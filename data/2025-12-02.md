*Di Feng,Kaixin Ma,Feng Nan,Haofeng Chen,Bohan Zhai,David Griffiths,Mingfei Gao,Zhe Gan,Eshan Verma,Yinfei Yang,Zhifeng Chen,Afshin Dehghan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SO-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to generate structured outputs conforming to JSON schemas from visual inputs across four domains (UI screens, natural images, documents, charts).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used in real-world agentic settings where outputs must be both correct and conform to predefined data schemas, but there's no systematic benchmark for evaluating schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs.

Method: Created SO-Bench with over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality across four visual domains. Conducted benchmarking experiments on open-source and proprietary models, plus training experiments to improve structured output capability.

Result: Benchmarking revealed persistent gaps in models' ability to predict accurate, schema-compliant outputs from visual inputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Training experiments showed significant improvements in structured output capability.

Conclusion: There's a significant need for better multimodal structured reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. SO-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, and training can substantially improve structured output performance. The benchmark will be made available to the community.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world, agentic settings where outputs must not only be correct, but also conform to predefined data schemas. Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.

### [2] [Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Wilson Fearn,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Saddle-Free Guidance (SFG) uses positive curvature of log density estimates to guide score-based models without labeled data or additional training, achieving state-of-the-art image generation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Auto-Guidance require labeled data or training additional models, making them impractical when labeled data is unavailable or training new models is infeasible.

Method: SFG leverages the discovery that positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance. It maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature to guide individual score-based models without additional training.

Result: SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When combined with Auto-Guidance, it achieves general state-of-the-art FD-DINOv2 scores. SFG also boosts diversity in FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 while maintaining prompt adherence and image fidelity.

Conclusion: SFG provides an effective guidance method for score-based models that doesn't require labeled data or additional training, offering computational efficiency comparable to CFG while working with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models.

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

*Bu Jin,Weize Li,Songen Gu,Yupeng Zheng,Yuhang Zheng,Zhengyi Zhou,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image, using unified latent representation for geometry, texture, segmentation, and kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated 3D objects are essential for realistic simulation and robotics, but manual creation is costly and difficult to scale. Existing methods are multi-stage and lack unified representation.

Method: UniArt uses diffusion-based framework with unified latent representation encoding geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. Introduces reversible joint-to-voxel embedding for spatial alignment of articulation features with volumetric geometry. Formulates articulation type prediction as open-set problem for generalization to novel joint categories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy on PartNet-Mobility benchmark. Demonstrates ability to generalize to novel joint categories and unseen object types.

Conclusion: UniArt provides an end-to-end solution for articulated 3D object synthesis from single images, overcoming limitations of multi-stage approaches and enabling scalable creation of articulated assets for simulation and robotics.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [4] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning is a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates Whole Slide Images through self-reflection and reasoning to find diagnostically relevant regions without dense annotations, outperforming existing methods on cancer analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole Slide Images are crucial for cancer diagnosis but extremely large (over 10 billion pixels), making manual navigation challenging and time-consuming. Pathologists use sampling, reasoning, and self-reflection to navigate WSIs, inspiring an automated approach.

Method: PathReasoning is a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates WSIs through multiple rounds: starting with random candidate regions, reviewing selections with self-reflection, reasoning over visual-clinical correspondence, and proposing new regions to explore. It builds a reasoning chain that directs attention to relevant areas, turning each slide into a sequence of question-guided views.

Result: PathReasoning outperforms strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs support accurate breast cancer report generation, significantly outperforming standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy.

Conclusion: PathReasoning enables efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability by prioritizing question-specific regions and constructing interpretable reasoning chains, addressing the challenge of navigating gigapixel WSIs in digital pathology.

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

*Cecilia G. Morales,Fanurs Chi En Teh,Kai Li,Pushpak Agrawal,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM algorithm enables adaptive, training-free rPPG monitoring that matches supervised methods' performance through online parameter optimization based on signal quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG methods use fixed parameters optimized for specific lighting/camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse real-world deployment environments.

Method: Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) - a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment.

Result: State-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods: MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, with 97.3% and 97.5% accuracy at 5 bpm threshold. Statistically equivalent to leading supervised methods (p > 0.2).

Conclusion: Adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG performance across diverse conditions, enabling real-time CPU operation without training while matching supervised methods.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.

*Yupei Zhang,Yating Huang,Wanming Hu,Lequan Yu,Hujun Yin,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal prototyping framework integrating histology and genomics for precision oncology, handling incomplete genomics data through biological prototyping, multiview alignment, bipartite fusion, and semantic genomics imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal integration of histology and genomics is promising for precision oncology, but phenotypic/genotypic heterogeneity and real-world scenarios with missing genomics data limit current methods' effectiveness.

Method: Four-component framework: 1) Biological Prototyping with text prompting and prototype-wise weighting, 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments, 3) Bipartite Fusion for shared and modality-specific information, 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation for missing data.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed flexible multimodal prototyping framework effectively integrates whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing real-world clinical scenarios with missing data.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

*Junwei Zhou,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D is a generative framework for reconstructing complete 3D objects from sparse, unposed, partially occluded views by inferring both visible and hidden geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based 3D reconstruction methods struggle with sparse, unposed, and partially occluded views, often producing incomplete or geometrically inconsistent results. There's a need for robust reconstruction in real-world scenarios where object surfaces are never directly observed.

Method: Integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning. Uses View-Wise Cross Attention for sparse-view feature fusion and Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention for inferring unobserved structure. Jointly models visible and hidden regions.

Result: Achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Faithfully reconstructs 3D objects consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts.

Conclusion: AmodalGen3D addresses the pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications by enabling complete 3D reconstruction from challenging sparse, occluded inputs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

### [8] [TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21946)
*Finlay G. C. Hudson,James A. D. Gardner,William A. P. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPVid-360 is a new task for predicting 3D directions to queried scene points across video sequences, even when points are outside the camera's field of view, enabling allocentric scene understanding without requiring 4D ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision systems lack persistent, panoramic understanding and struggle with object permanence beyond visible regions. Existing Track Any Point (TAP) methods fail to track points outside the field of view, limiting scene understanding capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce TAPVid-360 task that predicts 3D directions to scene points across video sequences. They use 360° videos as supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across full panoramas using a 2D pipeline. They adapt CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates.

Result: Created TAPVid360-10k dataset with 10k perspective videos and ground truth directional point tracking. Their baseline method outperforms existing TAP and TAPVid 3D approaches.

Conclusion: TAPVid-360 enables learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models, advancing persistent panoramic understanding in computer vision systems.

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

*Shilong Xiang,JangHyeon Lee,Min Namgung,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP: A multimodal framework that integrates satellite imagery, street view imagery, and population dynamics to predict urban walkability, outperforming single-source approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional walkability assessments are costly and difficult to scale. Existing single-source approaches (satellite imagery, street view, population data) each capture only one dimension of the walking environment, lacking comprehensive perspective.

Method: WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines them with a spatial aggregation module for neighborhood context, and fuses these with representations from a population dynamics foundation model.

Result: Evaluated at 4,660 locations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment.

Conclusion: Integration of visual (satellite and street view) and behavioral (population dynamics) signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment, demonstrating the value of multimodal approaches for urban walkability assessment.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAT3D is the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics simulation to create physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D generation methods often produce scenes with physical inconsistencies, object intersections, and lack of simulation readiness, limiting their practical applications in downstream tasks like robotic manipulation and scene editing.

Method: PAT3D generates 3D objects from text prompts, infers spatial relations, organizes them into hierarchical scene trees, converts them to simulation initial conditions, and uses a differentiable rigid-body simulator to achieve static equilibrium. It also includes simulation-in-the-loop optimization for physical stability and semantic consistency.

Result: PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality, and uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream applications.

Conclusion: PAT3D represents a significant advancement in text-to-3D scene generation by integrating physics simulation, producing physically plausible scenes that are ready for practical applications like robotic manipulation and scene editing.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

*Futian Wang,Chaoliu Weng,Xiao Wang,Zhen Chen,Zhicheng Zhao,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new large-scale dataset RPM-10K with 10,730 meter images addresses challenges in pointer meter reading, and a novel vision-language model MRLM uses physical relation injection for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pointer meter reading approaches are fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and difficulty distinguishing thin pointers from scale markings. The field lacks large-scale datasets to support robust algorithm development.

Method: Proposes MRLM (Meter Reading Language Model), a vision-language model based on physical relation injection. Instead of learning image-level correlations, it explicitly encodes geometric and causal relationships between pointers and scales, aligning perception with physical reasoning. Uses cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection to interpret dial configurations.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the new RPM-10K benchmark dataset containing 10,730 meter images that reflect real-world challenges.

Conclusion: The paper addresses key challenges in pointer meter reading by introducing a large-scale dataset and a novel vision-language model that incorporates physical reasoning, advancing robust meter reading recognition for smart power systems.

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPBoost transforms weak text prompts into strong visual bounding boxes for zero-shot medical image segmentation, outperforming text/visual-prompted baselines and few-shot models without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-prompted models lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift, while visual-prompted models need costly precise bounding boxes. Need a zero-shot method that converts weak text signals into strong spatial guidance without segmentation labels.

Method: Uses vision-language model to generate initial pseudo-bboxes from text, filters unreliable predictions with uncertainty-aware criterion, trains pseudo-labeled detector on retained pairs, expands bboxes during inference, then uses enhanced bboxes to guide segmentation models.

Result: Consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance across three diverse datasets, surpasses text- and visual-prompted baselines, and outperforms few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data.

Conclusion: PPBoost effectively bridges text and visual prompting by amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance, enabling zero-shot medical image segmentation that generalizes across modalities and anatomies without labeled data.

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundational benchmark and model for developing real-time interactive coaching systems, addressing critical gap in multi-modal LLM capabilities for practical AI assistants.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

*Sen Fang,Hongbin Zhong,Yalin Feng,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New acceleration pipeline for Rectified Flow models achieves 611% speedup for 512x512 image generation, far surpassing existing 18% acceleration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow and Flow Matching models have improved generative model performance but existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied due to theoretical and design differences from diffusion models.

Method: Comprehensive acceleration pipeline using batch processing with new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for flow-based models.

Result: Achieves 611% acceleration for 512x512 image generation, significantly outperforming existing public methods that typically achieve only 18% acceleration.

Conclusion: The proposed acceleration pipeline successfully addresses the unique challenges of Rectified Flow models and delivers substantial performance improvements beyond current non-generalized acceleration approaches.

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Shen Chen,Yijun Wang,Jianxin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedEyes is a reinforcement learning framework that models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to medical image regions, using off-policy expert guidance and dual-mode exploration to improve medical VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models using chain-of-thought reasoning via RLVR tend to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths due to purely on-policy learning, failing to capture the progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning of clinical workflows.

Method: 1) Incorporates off-policy expert guidance by converting expert visual search trajectories into structured behavioral signals; 2) Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) with dual-mode exploration (scanning for abnormality localization and drilling for regional analysis); 3) Confidence Value Sampler (CVS) using nucleus sampling and adaptive termination for diverse yet credible exploration; 4) Dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decoupling on-policy and off-policy learning signals.

Result: Achieves average performance improvement of +8.5% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior clinical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MedEyes successfully models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning, balances expert imitation with autonomous discovery, and shows potential for building interpretable medical AI systems through its reinforcement learning framework with off-policy guidance.

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: Training-free uncertainty estimation method for vision-language models using visual feature consistency and probabilistic embeddings to detect erroneous predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP have strong open vocabulary classification but assign high confidence to misclassifications, limiting reliability in safety-critical applications.

Method: Training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation using visual feature consistency within classes via feature projection and multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings.

Result: State-of-the-art error detection performance on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD, outperforming deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Conclusion: The method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, robust to distribution shift, works with few training images, and improves reliability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

*Joel Alberto Santos,Zongwei Wu,Xavier Alameda-Pineda,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Direct audio-visual object grounding without text transcription outperforms text-based methods in robustness to linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based object grounding pipelines are inefficient and lack robustness, especially with diverse accents. The authors question whether direct audio-visual alignment is possible without text transcription.

Method: Simplified task to single-word spoken instructions, created new audio-based grounding dataset with diverse objects and accents, adapted and benchmarked audio-visual models from related fields.

Result: Direct audio grounding is feasible and sometimes outperforms transcription-based methods, particularly in robustness to linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Direct audio-visual grounding shows promise for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems, encouraging renewed research in this direction.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple UDA method using frequency-domain style adaptation for object detection, with lightweight pre-processing only during training and no inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state-of-the-art UDA methods are overly complex, relying on adversarial training or elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models. There's a need for simpler yet effective approaches that reduce domain discrepancy without computational overhead.

Method: Learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce source-target domain discrepancy. Uses only a lightweight pre-processing module during training that is entirely discarded at inference time, incurring no additional computational overhead.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains on multiple domain-adaptive object detection benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in adapting from normal-weather/synthetic source domains to adverse weather/low-light target domains.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical and effective UDA method that simplifies domain adaptation through frequency-domain style adaptation, offering performance improvements without inference-time computational costs.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

*Jiayuan Du,Yiming Zhao,Zhenglong Guo,Yong Pan,Wenbo Hou,Zhihui Hao,Kun Zhan,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based architecture for 3D scene occupancy forecasting that directly predicts future occupancy from raw image features without BEV projection or discrete tokenization, achieving SOTA on nuScenes benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: VAE-based approaches use discrete occupancy tokens that limit representational capacity, while BEV-based methods rely on explicit geometric priors that may constrain modeling flexibility. The paper aims to overcome these limitations for more effective spatiotemporal dependency capture.

Method: Uses attention-based transformer architecture with sparse occupancy representation that bypasses intermediate BEV projection. Predicts multi-frame future occupancy end-to-end directly from raw image features, avoiding both discrete tokenization and BEV structural limitations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by significant margin. Demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding with high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by avoiding discrete tokenization and BEV constraints, enabling more effective spatiotemporal modeling and superior occupancy forecasting performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

### [21] [ICM-SR: Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization for Image Super-Resoultion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22048)
*Junoh Kang,Donghun Ryu,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM (image-conditioned manifold regularization) improves Real-ISR by using sparse structural information (colormap + Canny edges) instead of text conditioning, addressing misalignment and instability issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods use text-conditioned diffusion model manifolds, which are conceptually misaligned with the task (should be tied to LQ images) and practically flawed (produce color distortions/blurred edges). Dense image conditioning is unstable due to high information density.

Method: Proposes ICM (image-conditioned manifold regularization) that regularizes outputs toward a manifold conditioned on sparse structural information: combination of colormap and Canny edges, providing task-aligned and stable regularization.

Result: ICM significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating effectiveness for real-world applications. The method avoids instability of dense conditioning while improving final SR quality.

Conclusion: Using sparse structural information (colormap + edges) for manifold regularization provides better conceptual alignment and stability than text conditioning, leading to improved Real-ISR performance with enhanced perceptual quality.

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

TL;DR: TPCNet: A Retinex-based low-light enhancement method using Triple Physical Constraints derived from Kubelka-Munk theory, incorporating specular reflection and feature-space constraints for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based methods ignore specular reflection and use image-space constraints, limiting generalization. Need to incorporate specular reflection and reformulate physical constraints for better low-light enhancement.

Method: Proposes Triple Physical Constraints (TPCs) theory based on Kubelka-Munk theory, preserving specular reflection coefficient. Builds TPCNet with physical constraints constructed in feature space rather than image space, without introducing new parameters.

Result: TPCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets, with improved performance metrics and visual quality. Constraints effectively enhance performance without adding parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed TPCs theory and TPCNet successfully address limitations of previous Retinex-based methods by incorporating specular reflection and feature-space constraints, achieving superior low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online handwriting generation methods fail to handle unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting real-world application.

Method: Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA) with adaptive style branch for stroke attributes and adaptive content branch that decomposes characters into structural information and texture details.

Result: DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance for unseen OHG setting, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen writers and characters.

Conclusion: The proposed DNA model effectively addresses the challenge of generating handwriting for unseen writers and characters, making online handwriting generation more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Current video diffusion models lack seamless translation between different perspectives (egocentric vs exocentric), which is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models.

Method: WorldWander uses in-context learning with video diffusion transformers, integrating In-Context Perspective Alignment and Collaborative Position Encoding to model cross-view synchronization. Also created EgoExo-8K dataset with synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets.

Result: WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between egocentric and exocentric video perspectives, advancing video generation capabilities for cross-view applications.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for brain age estimation often fail to capture continuous neuromorphological changes, leading to suboptimal feature representation. Brain age estimation could serve as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss on T1w structural MRI data, combined with ResNet backbone. Employs Grad-RAM for visual explanation of regression results.

Result: Achieved MAE of 4.27 years and R² of 0.93 with limited training data, outperforming conventional deep regression with same backbone and comparable to state-of-the-art methods using larger datasets. Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced age-related features.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows superior performance for brain age estimation and demonstrates potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders, with brain age gap correlating with disease severity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: Previous multi-modal fusion methods use single dense networks that struggle with significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance in 3D understanding tasks.

Method: Proposes MoE3D integrating Mixture of Experts (MoE) with specialized expert networks for specific modalities/cross-modal interactions, MoE-based transformer for complementary visual features, information aggregation module, top-1 gating for efficiency, and progressive pre-training strategy leveraging semantic and 2D priors.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks, notably surpassing top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer benchmark.

Conclusion: MoE3D effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in multi-modal 3D understanding through specialized experts and efficient gating, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

*Chen Zhang,Yilu An,Ying Chen,Hao Li,Xitong Ling,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Yuxiang Lin,Zihui Wang,Rongshan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperST is a hyperbolic space-based framework that learns multi-level representations from spatial transcriptomics data to better align histology images with gene expression for improved prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting gene expression from histology images fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of spatial transcriptomics data, particularly on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. There's also an information asymmetry problem where gene expression contains molecular details lacking visual correlates in histology images.

Method: HyperST uses hyperbolic space to model the inherent hierarchy of ST data. It employs: 1) Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture spot-level and niche-level representations from both modalities, and 2) a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module to unify these representations while performing spatial alignment and structuring embeddings hierarchically.

Result: HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, demonstrating improved cross-modal prediction accuracy for spatial transcriptomics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the modality gap between histology images and gene expression by leveraging hyperbolic geometry to capture hierarchical relationships, enabling more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

### [29] [PROMPTMINER: Black-Box Prompt Stealing against Text-to-Image Generative Models via Reinforcement Learning and Fuzz Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22119)
*Mingzhe Li,Renhao Zhang,Zhiyang Wen,Siqi Pan,Bruno Castro da Silva,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMPTMINER is a black-box prompt stealing framework that recovers text prompts from generated images using RL optimization for subjects and fuzzing search for stylistic modifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality prompts for text-to-image models have become valuable digital assets, but are vulnerable to security and IP risks through prompt stealing attacks. Existing methods have limitations: they require white-box access, large labeled datasets, or rely only on captioning without optimization, making them impractical and non-adaptive.

Method: PROMPTMINER uses a two-phase approach: (1) Reinforcement learning-based optimization to reconstruct the primary subject from images, and (2) Fuzzing-driven search to recover stylistic modifiers. The framework operates in black-box settings without requiring gradient access or large supervised datasets.

Result: PROMPTMINER achieves CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. It outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5% in CLIP similarity on in-the-wild images with unknown generators, demonstrating better generalization. The method also maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations.

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER provides an effective black-box solution for prompt stealing that addresses limitations of existing approaches, offering superior performance, better generalization to unknown generators, and robustness against defensive measures, while supporting both malicious and beneficial applications like data attribution and watermark validation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

TL;DR: GoPrune: An accelerated structured pruning method using ℓ₂,ₚ-norm for sparse network learning with efficient optimization algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs suffer from increasing storage and computational costs as depth grows, hindering deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing ℓₚ-norm pruning methods only consider unstructured pruning with p∈(0,1) and have low computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes GoPrune method using ℓ₂,ₚ-norm for sparse network learning, extending p to [0,1). Develops efficient optimization algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization (PAM) with closed-form solutions for subproblems.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate superior performance in network pruning compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GoPrune provides an effective structured pruning approach with improved computational efficiency for CNN compression, enabling better deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cue3D is a model-agnostic framework that quantifies how different image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, etc.) influence single-image 3D generation across various state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent deep generative models have advanced single-image 3D generation, it's unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. Traditional computer vision relies on diverse monocular cues, but modern methods' cue dependencies remain unknown.

Method: Cue3D systematically perturbs seven different image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, local continuity) and measures their impact on 3D output quality across seven state-of-the-art methods spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms.

Result: Analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness (not texture) dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. Models show over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues like perspective and local continuity across different model families.

Conclusion: Cue3D advances understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

*Bin Wang,Ruotong Hu,Wenqian Wang,Wentong Li,Mingliang Gao,Runmin Cong,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework that improves VLM generalization in video tasks by preventing semantic space narrowing through competitive prompting and generic attribute anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on video tasks impairs generalization to unseen classes due to semantic space narrowing. Existing methods that regularize hand-crafted vs soft prompts weaken learning ability.

Method: 1) Textual prompts: introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard tokens, concatenated with soft tokens via learnable mapping layer for competitive prompting. 2) Visual prompts: use irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain pre-trained semantic space relevance.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction in video tasks.

Conclusion: The coupling prompt learning framework effectively mitigates semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning, preserving VLM generalization ability while maintaining learning capacity.

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIN (Virtual Inking Network) is an AI system that autonomously identifies surgical resection margins on whole-slide pathology images without physical ink, using cautery artifacts as markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current margin assessment relies on physical inking which is inconsistently applied and can be obscured by cautery artifacts, leading to variable and potentially inaccurate margin evaluation that impacts patient outcomes.

Method: VIN uses a frozen foundation model as feature extractor with a compact two-layer MLP for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. Trained on 120 H&E slides from 12 tonsil tissue blocks (~2TB data) with pathologist annotations.

Result: In blind testing on 20 unseen slides, VIN produced coherent margin overlays qualitatively aligned with expert annotations. Quantitative region-level accuracy was ~73.3%, with errors confined to limited areas not disrupting whole-slide margin continuity.

Conclusion: VIN successfully captures cautery-related histomorphology and provides reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into digital pathology workflows and downstream margin distance measurements.

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualVLA addresses action degeneration in generalizable Vision-Language-Action models by using dual-layer data pruning and dual-teacher adaptive distillation to balance action performance with reasoning capability, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When building generalizable VLA models, there's a trade-off: fine-tuning specialist VLAs with multimodal data to restore reasoning capabilities often leads to degraded action performance (action degeneration). The paper aims to solve this problem by maintaining both precise action execution and strong reasoning abilities.

Method: 1) Dual-layer data pruning to remove redundant embodied reasoning that interferes with action learning. 2) Dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that provides different supervision signals for different data domains while preserving reasoning ability. 3) VLA Score evaluation framework that decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions.

Result: DualVLA achieves 61.0% average success rate in SimplerEnv and 65.4 average score across eight multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating superior balance between action execution and multimodal understanding compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed DualVLA framework successfully addresses the action degeneration problem in generalist VLAs through careful data pruning and adaptive distillation, enabling models to maintain both reliable manipulation skills and strong reasoning capabilities simultaneously.

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: EASL is an emotion-aware sign language generation system that integrates multi-emotion guidance into LLM-based sign language synthesis, addressing the lack of emotional expressiveness in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based sign language generation focuses on semantic accuracy but overlooks emotional expressions, resulting in unnatural and inexpressive outputs that fail to capture the full communicative richness of sign language.

Method: Proposes EASL with emotion-semantic disentanglement modules using progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition.

Result: EASL achieves superior pose accuracy compared to all baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Conclusion: The proposed emotion-aware approach successfully addresses the emotional expressiveness gap in sign language generation, creating more natural and expressive sign language videos that better serve the Deaf community's communication needs.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

*Aiyinsi Zuo,Zhaoliang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-enabled network improves object detection in diverse weather conditions by using semantics for image enhancement and detection, achieving 1.47-8.80% mAP improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-based perception models for autonomous driving are trained on clear weather data and struggle with diverse weather conditions. Existing weather-specific models lack adaptability and focus too much on weather removal rather than comprehensive object detection.

Method: Two-stage architecture: Preprocessing Unit (PPU) uses U-shaped net enriched with semantics to refine degraded images, and Detection Unit (DTU) integrates semantic information for object detection using modified YOLO network. Semantics help generate plausible content for missing areas, understand boundaries, and maintain visual coherency.

Result: Achieves 1.47% to 8.80% improvement in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather conditions. Demonstrates the effectiveness of semantics for all-weather image transformation and object detection.

Conclusion: Semantic information is powerful for both image enhancement and object detection in diverse weather conditions. The approach offers a comprehensive solution for improving autonomous driving perception systems across varying weather scenarios.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stacked ensemble model using fine-tuned CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) with CatBoost meta-learner achieves 73% accuracy for multiclass KL grading and 87.5% for binary KOA detection, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee Osteoarthritis severity assessment using X-ray images and KL grading is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is subjective, leading to potential diagnostic inaccuracies that need automated solutions.

Method: Developed a stacked ensemble model combining fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) as base learners with CatBoost as meta-learner for binary KOA detection and multiclass KL grading classification.

Result: Achieved 73% balanced test accuracy for multiclass KL grading (5 levels) and 87.5% for binary KOA detection, outperforming previous works in literature.

Conclusion: The stacked ensemble approach provides an effective automated solution for KOA severity assessment, reducing subjectivity and improving diagnostic accuracy compared to manual KL grading.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian splatting has become mainstream for 3D reconstruction but is vulnerable to computation cost attacks that cause resource exhaustion and denial-of-service, threatening reliable deployment of 3DGS services.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) detector identifies attacked input images with poisoned textures, 2) purifier recovers benign images from attacked counterparts. Incorporates adversarial training to align distributions between recovered and original natural images.

Result: Effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety (defense effectiveness) and utility (reconstruction quality).

Conclusion: RemedyGS provides the first comprehensive black-box defense framework for 3DGS systems, enabling reliable deployment by protecting against computation cost attacks while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMTalker is a novel talking face generation framework that uses implicit motion transfer with cross-attention instead of traditional optical flow warping, achieving high-fidelity results with better identity preservation and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking face generation methods rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. There's a need for more robust motion rendering and better identity preservation.

Method: IMTalker uses implicit motion transfer with cross-attention mechanism to model motion discrepancy and identity alignment in a unified latent space. It includes an identity-adaptive module for motion-identity disentanglement and a lightweight flow-matching motion generator that takes audio, pose, and gaze cues as input.

Result: IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization. It achieves state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: IMTalker presents an effective framework for talking face generation that addresses limitations of flow-based methods through implicit motion transfer, achieving high-quality results with excellent efficiency and identity preservation.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRPO with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to improve PM concentration forecasting in East Asia, reducing false alarms by 47.3% while maintaining competitive F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for PM forecasting lack region-specific dynamics and real-time capability for East Asia's complex terrain. Standard point-wise objectives don't account for asymmetric operational costs where false alarms harm public trust while missed events endanger populations.

Method: 1) Created CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia with real-time observations; 2) Introduced Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities.

Result: Reduced regional error by 59.5% with new dataset; GRPO reduced False Alarm Rate by 47.3% compared to SFT-only baseline while achieving competitive F1-score for 48-120 hour forecasts.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves forecast reliability for practical air quality warning systems in East Asia by addressing operational cost mismatches through reinforcement learning alignment.

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS-CBM introduces a Partially Shared Concept Bottleneck Model that improves interpretability by addressing visual grounding, concept redundancy, and compactness metrics through multimodal concept generation, concept merging, and a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Concept Bottleneck Models using LLMs/VLMs face three key challenges: poor visual grounding (concepts not well-aligned with visual features), concept redundancy (overlapping concepts), and lack of principled metrics to balance accuracy and concept compactness.

Method: PS-CBM has three core components: (1) multimodal concept generator combining LLM semantics with exemplar-based visual cues, (2) Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness, and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA) metric that jointly captures predictive accuracy and concept compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show PS-CBM outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts.

Conclusion: PS-CBM effectively addresses fundamental limitations of existing CBMs, achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability through better visual grounding, reduced redundancy, and principled compactness-accuracy tradeoffs.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepGPT is a single-stage autoregressive framework for CAD boundary representation generation using Voronoi Half-Patch representation and dual VQ-VAEs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and versatile applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing B-rep generative methods rely on cascaded multi-stage networks due to the intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements, leading to error accumulation and computational inefficiency.

Method: Proposes Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation that decomposes B-reps into unified local units, uses dual VQ-VAEs to encode vertex topology and VHPs into vertex-based tokens, and trains a decoder-only Transformer for autoregressive token prediction.

Result: BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation and demonstrates versatility in conditional generation from various inputs (category labels, point clouds, text, images) as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

Conclusion: The single-stage autoregressive framework with VHP representation successfully addresses the limitations of multi-stage approaches, providing efficient and accurate B-rep generation with broad applicability across different CAD tasks.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

*Zhaoyang Wei,Wenchao Ding,Yanchao Hao,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRiP is a two-stage training framework that combines guided perception and reasoning to improve visual grounded reasoning in multimodal AI, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual reasoning are trapped between unstable end-to-end RL and rigid supervised fine-tuning, leading to models that either struggle to learn or lack cognitive flexibility for complex real-world scenes.

Method: GRiP uses a two-stage framework with cognitive-enhanced RL featuring: 1) Salience-Weighted IoU Reward to prioritize mission-critical object localization, and 2) Multi-Heuristic Reward to encourage diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways.

Result: GRiP achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on challenging benchmarks like TreeBench and V* Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains from Qwen2.5-VL-7B initialization.

Conclusion: Guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence, moving beyond simplistic rewards.

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

*Adnan Ferdous Ashrafi,Hasanul Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Graph Convolutional Network model combining Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks achieves 74.82% accuracy in classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder using multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data from the ABIDE I dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with varied symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely challenging. There is a need for improved diagnostic methods that can leverage multimodal data to better understand the condition.

Method: The paper proposes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model that incorporates Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to classify ASD. The model uses multimodal data from the ABIDE I dataset including resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and phenotypic variables from 870 patients. A multi-branch architecture processes each modality individually before merging via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to create a population graph. Chebyshev polynomial filters enable localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, while GAT layers enhance node representations through attention-weighted aggregation of neighboring information.

Result: The model achieved a test accuracy of 74.82% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire ABIDE I dataset, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art baselines including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs. The model was trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal GCN model with Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks demonstrates superior performance in ASD classification compared to existing methods, offering a promising approach for early and objective diagnosis of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder.

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTR-VP: Vision-based trajectory planning using ViT encoder to replace map features with learned visual representations, trained to align with motion prediction frameworks, evaluated on Waymo dataset showing multi-future prediction improves planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a vision-based trajectory planning method that can replace traditional map-based features with learned visual representations from camera images, enabling autonomous driving without reliance on detailed maps.

Method: Uses ViT encoder to process raw images and past kinematic state, producing context embeddings inspired by MTR encoder. Replaces MTR's learnable intention queries with cross-attention on intent and context embeddings. Evaluated on Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset for 5-second trajectory prediction.

Result: Transformer-based methods combining visual and kinetic features were not effective at producing useful scene context embeddings, even with CLIP/DINOv2 augmentations. However, predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single trajectory boosted planning performance.

Conclusion: While vision-based approaches can replace map features, current transformer architectures struggle to effectively combine visual and kinetic modalities for scene understanding, but multi-future prediction remains a valuable strategy for improving planning performance.

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

TL;DR: FECO framework learns dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images using shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning to overcome challenges of shoe appearance diversity and monotonous ground features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foot contact is critical for human movement and interaction, but existing methods approximate it with zero-velocity constraints and focus on joint-level contact, missing detailed foot-world interaction. Dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images is underexplored despite being crucial for accurate modeling.

Method: FECO framework with two key components: 1) shoe style adversarial training to enforce style-invariant features for contact estimation, overcoming shoe appearance diversity; 2) ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context to effectively utilize ground information despite its monotonous appearance.

Result: The proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: FECO framework successfully addresses the challenges of dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images through style-invariant and ground-aware learning, advancing accurate modeling of foot-world interaction. Code will be released for further research.

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

TL;DR: ARPGNet is a facial expression recognition model that learns spatial-temporal representations by fusing appearance and relation information through parallel graph attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous facial expression recognition methods rely on pre-trained CNNs for appearance features but overlook relationships between facial regions, which are crucial for capturing expression dynamics.

Method: Builds facial region relation graph with graph attention to model region relationships, then uses parallel graph attention fusion module to combine relational representations with CNN-based appearance representations, exploring both inter-sequence complementarity and intra-sequence temporal dynamics.

Result: Outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on three facial expression recognition datasets.

Conclusion: ARPGNet effectively learns mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations by modeling both appearance and relational information, demonstrating the importance of facial region relationships for expression recognition.

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual inversion methods for 3D object generation require additional training time and lack control ability. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by developing a more efficient and controllable approach.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) Uses off-the-shelf image adapters to generate 3D objects without textual inversion, enabling enhanced control over depth, pose, and text conditions. (2) Implements a depth conditioned warmup strategy to improve 3D consistency.

Result: Qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance to text-inversion-based alternatives with improved 3D consistency. User study confirms better input image matching and 3D consistency maintenance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Control3D-IP method successfully addresses limitations of textual inversion approaches by providing more efficient training, better control over generation conditions, and improved 3D consistency, validated through comprehensive experiments and user studies.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views, which is problematic for editing 3D representations like NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion framework with a consistency loss that guides diffusion sampling toward coherent edits.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively enforces multi-view consistency during image editing, making it suitable for editing 3D representations while maintaining geometric and photometric coherence across views.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications by enabling multi-image understanding across modalities and time points.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing high-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting models from low-resolution inputs rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution models, which suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity due to cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models.

Method: IE-SRGS jointly leverages external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. It uses 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employs multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy integrates these two sources to guide 3D Gaussian optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS effectively addresses the 3D Gaussian ambiguity problem by synergistically exploiting complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features through mask-guided fusion, enabling high-fidelity 3DGS super-resolution reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: A novel tampering detection method using adversarial perturbations on SAM to create a "blank canvas" that reveals forged regions when images are modified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC-based image editing simplifies realistic image modification, creating serious risks of image forgery that need effective detection methods.

Method: Instead of training SAM to detect tampering, the approach transforms images into "blank canvases" using adversarial perturbations that prevent SAM from seeing anything. A frequency-aware optimization strategy is introduced to thoroughly deceive SAM's powerful perception capabilities.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for tamper localization.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial perturbation approach with frequency-aware optimization successfully enables SAM to identify forged regions by creating a baseline "blank canvas" state that reveals modifications.

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: TTSnap improves test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models by pruning low-quality noise seeds early using noise-aware reward models trained via self-distillation, reducing computational costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods require fully denoising multiple noise seeds to compute rewards, which is computationally expensive and limits exploration under fixed budgets. The challenge is that reward models work in the clean image domain, making intermediate estimates unreliable for early pruning.

Method: Train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align rewards for intermediate noisy estimates with final clean images. Use curriculum training that progressively shifts from clean to noisy images for stability. Prune low-quality candidates early without full denoising.

Result: Improves performance by over 16% compared to existing methods, enables more efficient test-time scaling, provides orthogonal gains with post-training techniques and local optimization, and introduces a new metric for reward alignment and budget utilization.

Conclusion: TTSnap offers an effective framework for computationally efficient test-time scaling in text-to-image diffusion models by enabling early pruning through noise-aware reward models, significantly improving performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

### [56] [Semantic Anchoring for Robust Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22245)
*Seoyun Yang,Gihoon Kim,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic anchoring method for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, addressing the trade-off between subject fidelity and text-image alignment when adapting to new concepts from few reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with personalization - adapting to user-specific subjects from few reference images. There's a fundamental trade-off: focusing on subject fidelity causes overfitting to reference images and loses pretrained semantic priors, while emphasizing prior preservation prevents learning new personalized attributes.

Method: Proposes semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. Reformulates personalization as learning rare concepts guided by their frequent counterparts through semantic anchoring, enabling stable and controlled adaptation while expanding pretrained distribution toward personalized regions.

Result: Achieves stable adaptation with consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of the anchoring strategy.

Conclusion: Semantic anchoring provides an effective solution to the personalization challenge in diffusion models, enabling controlled adaptation that balances learning new concepts with preserving pretrained semantic structure.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

TL;DR: FreqWarm: A frequency warm-up curriculum that improves generation quality in latent diffusion models by increasing early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during training, addressing the reconstruction-generation trade-off in high-dimensional autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models show a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off where higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality declines. This is traced to different behaviors in high-frequency encoding vs decoding - decoders need high-frequency latent components for detail recovery, but encoders under-represent high-frequency content, leading to insufficient exposure and underfitting in diffusion training.

Method: FreqWarm is a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. It explicitly manages frequency exposure to make high-dimensional latent spaces more diffusible targets.

Result: FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality across several high-dimensional autoencoders: decreases gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32. The method is architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

Conclusion: Explicitly managing frequency exposure through curriculum learning can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets, addressing the fundamental reconstruction-generation trade-off in latent diffusion models without requiring autoencoder modifications.

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

TL;DR: UMind-VL is a unified ultrasound foundation model that bridges low-level perception (segmentation, localization) with high-level interpretation (diagnosis, reasoning) using a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ultrasound domain lacks comprehensive solutions that can integrate both pixel-level structural understanding and complex clinical reasoning, creating a gap between low-level perception and high-level interpretation tasks.

Method: 1) Created UMind-DS dataset with 1.2M ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. 2) Developed UMind-VL with lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. 3) Used task-specific tokens to unify segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis within one framework.

Result: UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: UMind-VL successfully bridges the gap between ultrasound perception and interpretation, providing a unified foundation model that synergizes pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning in a single comprehensive framework.

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

TL;DR: GSPure is the first watermark purification framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that removes watermarks while preserving scene integrity by isolating watermark-related Gaussian primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS watermarking approaches may not guarantee robust protection, and conventional 2D image watermark removal techniques don't generalize well to 3DGS due to its specialized rendering pipeline and unique Gaussian primitive attributes.

Method: GSPure analyzes view-dependent rendering contributions and uses geometrically accurate feature clustering to precisely isolate and remove watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity.

Result: Achieves best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Consistently outperforms existing methods in effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: GSPure demonstrates vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS watermarking frameworks and provides an effective purification method, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking approaches for 3D Gaussian Splatting assets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

*Xiaosong Jia,Yanhao Liu,Junqi You,Renqiu Xia,Yu Hong,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVGGT adapts feed-forward reconstruction (VGGT) for autonomous driving by incorporating AD-specific priors like minimal view overlap, known camera parameters, and fixed relative camera positions, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of VGGT to autonomous driving systems yields suboptimal results due to different task priors. AD systems have unique characteristics: minimal camera view overlap, known camera intrinsics/extrinsics, and fixed relative camera positions despite ego motion.

Method: Proposes DriveVGGT with three key components: 1) Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module for independent multi-camera video processing leveraging spatiotemporal continuity, 2) Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module with normalized relative pose embeddings for cross-camera consistency, 3) Extended heads including absolute scale head and ego vehicle pose head.

Result: DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, and fastVGGT on autonomous driving datasets. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Conclusion: DriveVGGT successfully integrates AD-specific priors into a feed-forward reconstruction framework, demonstrating superior performance for autonomous driving applications through specialized attention mechanisms and extended output heads.

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "patch collapse" - a quantum mechanics-inspired concept where observing certain image patches reduces uncertainty in others, and uses this to optimize patch ordering for better vision efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vision efficiency by understanding how patch dependencies work in images, similar to quantum wave function collapse, and leverage this to optimize patch ordering for various vision tasks.

Method: Learn an autoencoder that softly selects patches to reconstruct each target patch, then use PageRank on the learned dependency graph to determine optimal patch collapse order.

Result: 1) Boosted autoregressive image generation by retraining MAR model; 2) Achieved high classification accuracy with only 22% of high-rank patches using Vision Transformers; 3) Demonstrated benefits for various masked image modeling methods.

Conclusion: Patch collapse provides a novel perspective for efficient image modeling that improves vision efficiency across multiple tasks, with promising applications in image generation and classification.

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Match-and-Fuse is a zero-shot, training-free method for generating consistent image sets that share common visual elements while varying in viewpoint, time, and surrounding content, using graph-based pairwise generation with feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods work on individual images or densely sampled videos, but lack the ability to generate consistent unstructured image sets that share common visual elements while varying in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content.

Method: Models the task as a graph where each node is an image and each edge triggers joint generation of image pairs. Uses feature fusion across image pairs guided by dense input correspondences without requiring masks or manual supervision. Leverages an emergent prior in text-to-image models for coherent multi-view generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, enabling new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse provides an effective zero-shot, training-free framework for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets, advancing content creation from image collections.

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

TL;DR: MVMAE is a self-supervised framework that uses multi-view radiology data and text reports to learn robust medical image representations, outperforming baselines on disease classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ML systems need pretraining strategies that exploit clinical data structure. Radiology studies naturally have multi-view organization (different imaging projections) that can be leveraged for learning view-invariant and disease-relevant representations.

Method: MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, using clinical redundancy across projections as self-supervision. MVMAE-V2T extends this by incorporating radiology reports as auxiliary text-based learning signals while maintaining vision-only inference.

Result: MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines on disease classification across three large-scale public datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, PadChest). MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, especially in low-label regimes where textual supervision is most beneficial.

Conclusion: Structural (multi-view) and textual supervision are complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models. Exploiting clinical data organization and incorporating text reports enhances representation learning for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

TL;DR: A Swin Transformer-based neck architecture with adjusted window sizes improves small object detection for sparse bird targets where traditional methods struggle due to limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection is challenging due to size, blur, and occlusion. Current methods work well for small dense objects (crowds, remote sensing) but fail for small sparse objects like birds where training data is limited, making feature learning difficult.

Method: Propose a specialized method for bird detection using Swin Transformer in the neck (between backbone and prediction head) with hierarchical design. Adjust shifted window sizes to better capture small object features, combined with CenterNet framework.

Result: Experiments show Swin Transformer-based neck with CenterNet improves performance when window sizes are adjusted. Smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAP for small object detection.

Conclusion: Adapting Swin Transformer window sizes in the neck architecture effectively addresses small sparse object detection challenges, particularly for bird detection where traditional methods underperform.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

Motivation: Existing video colorization methods suffer from temporal flickering or require extensive manual input, creating a need for automated, high-fidelity solutions.

Method: Uses language-conditioned diffusion model with automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; employs optical flow (RAFT) for temporal warping of color information from previous frames, plus a correction step to fix inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS30 and VIDEVO20 benchmarks in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully automates high-fidelity video colorization using semantic guidance from language and segmentation, solving temporal flickering issues without requiring manual color input.

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations, beyond the known answer choice order sensitivity.

Method: Large-scale study with 7 MLLMs and 5 VQA datasets, testing 48 distinct prompt format variations to analyze impact of three key variation factors in prompt formatting.

Result: Multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes even when semantically neutral; biases persist independently of known order biases or model confidence; existing mitigation strategies fail to address these new biases.

Conclusion: Current MLLM evaluations on multiple-choice VQA benchmarks are unreliable due to unexplored prompt format biases that require new mitigation approaches beyond existing strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

TL;DR: A novel alignment strategy for Normalizing Flows that leverages invertibility to align generative pass features with vision foundation models, improving training speed, generative quality, and classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Normalizing Flows have limited generative quality due to poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. The authors aim to improve NF performance by better leveraging their invertible architecture for representation learning.

Method: Proposes an alignment strategy that aligns intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, rather than regularizing the forward pass. Also introduces a training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification to better evaluate semantic knowledge.

Result: Achieves 3.3× faster training of NFs while significantly improving both generative quality and classification accuracy. Establishes new state-of-the-art results for NFs on ImageNet 64×64 and 256×256.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment strategy effectively leverages the invertibility of NFs to improve semantic representations, leading to faster training and better performance across both generative and discriminative tasks.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16-64x64), combining super-resolution, localization, and semantic alignment with vision-language models for interpretable forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions (downsampling, compression, cross-domain shifts) and operate as opaque classifiers without providing explanations, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.

Method: INSIGHT combines: 1) hierarchical super-resolution to amplify subtle forensic cues without artifacts, 2) Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions with generative patterns, 3) CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors, and 4) a vision-language model with structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought prompting for consistent explanations verified through dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline.

Result: INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation across diverse domains (animals, vehicles, abstract synthetic scenes), outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines.

Conclusion: INSIGHT provides a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establishes a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification by addressing both detection robustness and interpretability challenges.

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

TL;DR: AnchorFlow is a training-free 3D editing method that uses latent anchor consistency to produce stable, semantically faithful edits without mask supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free 3D editing approaches struggle with producing strong or geometrically stable edits due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling.

Method: AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between source and target trajectories, enforcing coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss and anchor-aligned update rule to ensure stable transformations.

Result: Experiments on Eval3DEdit benchmark show AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types, without requiring mask supervision.

Conclusion: AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications while preserving geometric fidelity through latent anchor consistency, making it an effective mask-free solution for training-free 3D editing.

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

TL;DR: RS-EoT addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing vision-language models by introducing an iterative evidence-seeking paradigm that overcomes the "Glance Effect" through language-driven visual inspection cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models in remote sensing suffer from "pseudo reasoning" - they narrate reasoning processes rather than genuinely reasoning based on visual evidence, caused by the "Glance Effect" where single, coarse perceptions lead to incomplete understanding.

Method: Proposes RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. Implements SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. Uses a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks, then RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader scenarios.

Result: RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses confirm clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, showing RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed RS-EoT paradigm effectively addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing by promoting genuine evidence-seeking behavior through iterative language-driven visual inspection, overcoming limitations of single-glance perception in large-scale imagery analysis.

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world UAV data collection faces constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly.

Method: Created a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset with 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban, suburbs, forests, coastal) and weather conditions, featuring multiple UAV models and five modalities (RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, DVS).

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D offers a public benchmark with controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations to advance 3D perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments.

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

TL;DR: DiffStyle360 is a diffusion-based framework for 3D head stylization that generates multi-view consistent stylizations from a single style reference image without per-style training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D head stylization methods require computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning for new styles, limiting their practical application. The authors aim to create a more efficient and flexible solution.

Method: Builds on DiffPortrait360 architecture with two key components: Style Appearance Module for style-content disentanglement, and Style Fusion Attention for adaptive structure preservation vs. stylization balance. Uses 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for fine-tuning and temperature-based key scaling for stylization intensity control.

Result: Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 datasets show DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality compared to state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based methods across challenging style domains.

Conclusion: DiffStyle360 provides an effective framework for identity-preserving 3D head stylization that works across diverse artistic domains without requiring per-style training, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

*Minghao Yin,Yukang Cao,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WUKONG is a training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing using flow-based transformers, solving optimal transport barycenter problems for smooth shape transitions and using similarity-guided semantic consistency for texture preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 3D morphing methods rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation, which limits generalization and requires costly preprocessing. There's a need for a more efficient, high-fidelity approach to 3D morphing that can handle both geometry and texture transitions.

Method: WUKONG leverages flow-based transformers' generative prior for 3D transitions. It formulates morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem for smooth shape transitions, uses sequential initialization to prevent geometric distortions, and employs similarity-guided semantic consistency for texture preservation with selective high-frequency detail retention.

Result: Extensive evaluations show WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations with high-fidelity transitions and rich texture details.

Conclusion: WUKONG provides an effective training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that overcomes limitations of conventional methods, offering smooth transitions, preserved identity coherence, and faithful texture preservation without common artifacts.

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fin3R is a lightweight fine-tuning method that improves feed-forward 3D reconstruction models by distilling fine geometric details from a monocular teacher model using LoRA adapters, enhancing geometric accuracy without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to two main issues: 1) scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision, and 2) inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression.

Method: Freeze the decoder (handles view matching) and fine-tune only the image encoder using a lightweight LoRA adapter. Enrich the encoder with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only tiny LoRA weights that leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Conclusion: Fin3R provides a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method that significantly improves geometric accuracy of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models without compromising inference efficiency.

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkeletonAgent is a novel framework that bridges action recognition models with LLMs through cooperative agents to extract more discriminative skeletal representations for distinguishing similar actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use LLMs in isolation from recognition models without performance feedback, leading to insufficient discriminative cues for distinguishing similar actions in skeleton-based action recognition.

Method: Proposes SkeletonAgent with two cooperative agents: Questioner identifies confused classes for LLM context, and Selector parses LLM responses to extract joint-level constraints for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmarks: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human.

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent effectively bridges recognition models and LLMs through cooperative agents, enabling more targeted guidance and finer-grained cross-modal alignment for improved skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

TL;DR: ABounD: Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping to address data scarcity and ambiguous normal/abnormal boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection is challenging due to data scarcity that blurs boundaries between normal and abnormal states, causing missed subtle defects and rejection of atypical normal samples. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative.

Method: Proposes ABounD framework with two key components: 1) Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module that produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features; 2) Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) that sculpts precise decision margins by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training uses single-stage Concept-Boundary Loss with ABF as main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers for optimization stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets for few-shot multi-class anomaly detection. The method yields decision boundaries that closely follow normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment.

Conclusion: ABounD successfully addresses the challenges of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection through a unified framework that integrates semantic concept learning with adversarial boundary shaping, resulting in improved discrimination between normal and abnormal samples despite data scarcity.

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Motivation: Deepfake generation has advanced significantly, creating highly realistic manipulated media that raises serious misuse concerns. There's an urgent need for robust and reliable deepfake detection, particularly focusing on zero-shot detection (generalizable detection) that works across different generation techniques.

Method: Proposes FauxNet based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. Extracts temporal VSR features from videos to identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. Focuses on zero-shot detection (generalizable detection) and can attribute videos to specific generation techniques.

Result: FauxNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot detection setting. The network can successfully attribute videos to their specific generation techniques. Introduces new Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF datasets comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos created with six recent deepfake generation techniques.

Conclusion: FauxNet demonstrates superior performance on Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, providing robust deepfake detection with zero-shot generalization capability and attribution functionality. The Authentica datasets will be publicly available to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling quantum dot arrays requires automated tuning strategies that depend on accurate state identification from charge-stability diagrams, necessitating evaluation of machine learning approaches for this task.

Method: Benchmarked four ML architectures (U-Nets, ViTs, MDNs, CNNs) for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs across different data budgets and normalization schemes using synthetic and experimental data.

Result: U-Nets and ViTs achieved highest MSE scores on synthetic data (>0.98) but failed to generalize to experimental data. MDNs were computationally efficient with stable training but lower performance. CNNs offered best trade-off on experimental data with strong accuracy and far fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CNNs with min-max normalization provide the most practical approach for quantum dot charge-stability diagram analysis, offering good accuracy with computational efficiency for real-world experimental data.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a paradigm shift from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos, providing a benchmark and methodology for intent analysis that addresses the fundamental question of why videos are manipulated.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

TL;DR: ITS3D improves text-to-3D generation quality through inference-time scaling without retraining, using verifier-guided search to optimize Gaussian noise inputs with techniques for stability, efficiency, and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance generative quality in text-guided 3D diffusion models without additional training by exploring inference-time scaling, addressing the challenge of improving 3D generation quality through computational optimization rather than model retraining.

Method: ITS3D formulates the task as an optimization problem to find optimal Gaussian noise inputs. It uses a verifier-guided search algorithm with three key techniques: 1) Gaussian normalization to stabilize search by correcting distribution shifts, 2) SVD-based compression to reduce dimensionality of the 3D search space, and 3) singular space reset mechanism to prevent local minima by dynamically updating search space based on diversity measures.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, showing the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes without requiring additional model training.

Conclusion: The proposed ITS3D framework successfully improves 3D generation quality through inference-time optimization, demonstrating that efficient search methods can enhance generative processes without retraining, with source code made publicly available.

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Motivation: Fire reconstruction is challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and high-frequency features. The goal is to reconstruct dynamic fire from only three views, which creates an under-constrained geometry problem that needs to be solved.

Method: Separates static background from dynamic fire using dense multi-view stereo with monocular depth priors. Initializes fire as 3D flow field from fused per-view dense optical flow projections. Uses 3D Gaussians with lifetime and linear velocity encoding to capture high-frequency features. Employs custom hardware synchronization for sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios using affordable commodity hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully reconstructs dynamic fire in 3D from limited camera views by combining Gaussian-based representation with optical flow fusion and hardware synchronization, enabling practical fire reconstruction with accessible equipment.

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

*Ahmad Mohammadshirazi,Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi,Dheeraj Kulshrestha,Rajiv Ramnath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocVAL is a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers spatial reasoning ability from large teacher models to deployable student VLMs for DocVQA, achieving strong performance without text detection/OCR at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DocVQA systems face a sharp accuracy-efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance.

Method: Three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter/denoise training signals, (2) multi-module validator (VAL) enforcing answer correctness and geometric consistency with pixel-level error feedback, (3) two-stage student training: first learns from validated CoT traces, then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback.

Result: Student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4% ANLS and 82.4% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain, iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement.

Conclusion: DocVAL successfully transfers spatial reasoning ability to deployable student models, releasing 95k high-quality validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on perception tasks (detection/segmentation) but overlook reasoning capabilities needed to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. There's a gap in evaluating mid-level road semantics that link low-level perception to high-level planning.

Method: 1) RoadSceneBench benchmark: lightweight, information-rich dataset emphasizing relational understanding and structural consistency. 2) HRRP-T training framework: Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency for VLMs, using adaptive reward signals to promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. The benchmark provides compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and structure-aware autonomous perception.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench addresses the gap in reasoning capabilities for road scene understanding, enabling models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning for autonomous driving and digital map construction.

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models for autonomous driving suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and oversimplified input-output mappings, which hinder performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning.

Method: CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. It explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action Chain-of-Thought during training to align reasoning and action spaces across multiple driving tasks, and performs implicit CoT reasoning during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world (nuScenes) and simulated (Bench2Drive) benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations.

Conclusion: CoT4AD successfully enhances numerical and causal reasoning in VLA models for autonomous driving through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieving superior performance across multiple driving tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: Existing approaches for text-based person anomaly retrieval rely on complex deep-learning techniques, raising the question of how to optimize models for greater fine-grained feature extraction.

Method: 1) Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with Vision-Language Model (VLM) to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained features. 2) Unified Image-Text (UIT) model with multiple loss functions (ITC, ITM, MLM, MIM). 3) Novel iterative ensemble strategy. 4) Feature selection algorithm guided by LHP model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of extracting fine-grained features for text-based person anomaly retrieval through hybrid perspective modeling, multi-loss training, and innovative ensemble strategies.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frozen DINOv3 foundation model shows strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning, relying on global low-frequency structures as transferable authenticity cues rather than generator-specific artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to poor performance on unseen generators. The paper aims to understand and leverage foundation models' inherent cross-generator detection capabilities.

Method: Systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives reveal DINOv3's reliance on global low-frequency structures. A training-free token-ranking strategy selects authenticity-relevant tokens, followed by a lightweight linear probe for detection.

Result: DINOv3 exhibits strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning. The token subset selection consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets, providing an efficient baseline.

Conclusion: Foundation models generalize across diverse generators by relying on global low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues. The approach offers a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

TL;DR: Visual CoT designs mainly speed up convergence but don't improve final performance; concise grounding-focused CoT with minimal essential steps generalizes best across different maze sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of generalizable visual reasoning ability in VLMs, and determine which CoT formats truly support generalizable reasoning rather than just accelerating convergence.

Method: Systematic evaluation using a controlled maze-solving benchmark with fully visual reasoning rules, tunable difficulty via grid size, and automatically generated intermediate steps. Tested three CoT formats (Language CoT, Grounding CoT with spatial coordinates, Visual CoT with image manipulations) on Qwen2.5-VL-7B under standard SFT-then-RL pipeline.

Result: Visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but don't lift final performance ceiling; concise CoT with only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; CoT retaining only minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes.

Conclusion: Findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning - minimal, essential grounding-focused CoT yields best generalization.

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

TL;DR: Dimitra++ is a new audio-driven talking head generation framework that uses a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer to generate realistic facial motion including lip movement, expressions, and head pose from audio input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create more realistic talking head generation that goes beyond just lip sync to include comprehensive facial motion including expressions and head pose, which are crucial for natural-looking talking avatars.

Method: Uses a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) that models facial motion sequences in 3D representation. The model is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image for appearance and an audio sequence to drive the motion.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ datasets in both quantitative/qualitative evaluations and user studies, generating realistic talking heads with synchronized lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

Conclusion: Dimitra++ successfully demonstrates a diffusion-based approach for comprehensive audio-driven talking head generation that produces more realistic results than previous methods by modeling complete facial motion including expressions and head pose.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we propose a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) to model facial motion sequences, employing a 3D representation. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

*Haoxi Zeng,Haoxuan Li,Yi Bin,Pengpeng Zeng,Xing Xu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HarmoCLIP addresses CLIP's limited fine-grained understanding by harmonizing global and region representations through explicit local alignment without disrupting global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP lacks region-level supervision, limiting its fine-grained semantic understanding. Existing methods to improve local perception unintentionally disrupt global alignment, creating a persistent trade-off between local and global representations.

Method: Introduces explicit fine-grained semantic supervision to directly align textual segments with corresponding visual regions. Uses Region-Language Alignment supervision to promote fine-grained learning without compromising global consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 69.78% improvement on global retrieval tasks and 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP provides a balanced, efficient, plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP, effectively bridging image region space and textual space while maintaining both fine-grained and global semantic understanding.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing demand for effective research communication through posters, but a gap exists in understanding how papers correspond to poster layouts. Current approaches lack large-scale datasets with paired paper-layout annotations.

Method: Introduces SciPostGen dataset and a Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation framework that retrieves layouts consistent with given papers and uses them as guidance for layout generation. Experiments conducted with and without layout constraints.

Result: Analyses show paper structures correlate with layout element counts. The retriever successfully estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and the framework generates layouts that satisfy given constraints.

Conclusion: SciPostGen bridges the gap in paper-layout understanding, and the proposed framework effectively generates poster layouts that align with paper structures while accommodating user constraints.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

Motivation: Current gaze accuracy in VR/AR applications is insufficient for spatial computing requirements, necessitating better datasets and methods for precise gaze tracking.

Method: 1) Created GazeTrack dataset using high-precision equipment with diverse demographics; 2) Proposed shape error regularization for pupil ellipse fitting; 3) Developed novel coordinate transformation method (paper unfolding analogy); 4) Built gaze vector generation model with optimized computational complexity.

Result: Achieved reduced gaze angle error compared to other methods while maintaining lower computational complexity, demonstrating improved accuracy for spatial computing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, dataset, and methods significantly advance gaze tracking accuracy for VR/AR applications, addressing the precision requirements of spatial computing through innovative regularization and transformation techniques.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

*Hyakka Nakada,Marika Kubota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses text removal from document images with dense text, creating benchmark data and developing a Bayesian optimization method for flexible mask profile tuning, finding character-wise masks work best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text removal methods focus on simple scene text in outdoor images, but there's little research on complex document images with dense text. Industrial applications need accurate text removal from documents, but performance is vulnerable to mask profile perturbations.

Method: Created benchmark data for dense text removal, developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The approach focuses on precise tuning of mask shapes rather than using minimum cover of text regions.

Result: Found that text-removal performance is vulnerable to mask profile perturbation, character-wise masks are optimal (not minimum cover of text regions), and Bayesian optimization can effectively learn flexible mask parameters.

Conclusion: The research provides a user-friendly guideline for manual masking in practical text-removal tasks, paving the way for better text removal from complex document images with dense text through precise mask profile tuning.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes ReAG with: 1) Coarse- and fine-grained retrieval, 2) A critic model to filter irrelevant passages, 3) Multi-stage training using reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, and 4) Supervised fine-tuning only as a cold start.

Result: Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek show ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

Conclusion: ReAG effectively addresses limitations of current retrieval-augmented MLLMs by combining improved retrieval with enhanced reasoning capabilities, resulting in better performance on knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D diffusion models suffer from computationally expensive iterative denoising. While caching methods work for 2D and video generation, directly applying them to 3D models disrupts geometric consistency due to accumulated numerical errors in cached latent features, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes Fast3Dcache with two key components: 1) Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas based on voxel stabilization patterns, and 2) Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion.

Result: Achieves up to 27.12% speed-up and 54.8% reduction in FLOPs with minimal degradation in geometric quality: only 2.48% increase in Chamfer Distance and 1.95% decrease in F-Score.

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache provides an effective training-free solution to accelerate 3D diffusion inference while maintaining geometric fidelity, overcoming the limitations of direct application of 2D/video caching techniques to 3D models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

Motivation: Domain shifts in computational pathology (from staining protocols, scanners, imaging settings) hinder model generalization. Vision-language models like PLIP have limited zero-shot performance due to prompt sensitivity, and histopathology lacks semantic descriptors for domain-specific prompts, requiring a data-driven approach.

Method: Proposes Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) that learns multiple input tokens per domain, trains them separately for each domain, then averages across domains to create domain-invariant prompts. A student model distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder using these prompts to align visual features with domain-invariant embeddings.

Result: Significant improvement in average F1-score over existing state-of-the-art knowledge distillation approaches for domain generalization on histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: DIPT enables robust computational pathology model deployment in real-world clinical settings with heterogeneous data sources by enhancing domain generalization through domain-invariant prompt learning and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

### [96] [Diff-ICMH: Harmonizing Machine and Human Vision in Image Compression with Generative Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22549)
*Ruoyu Feng,Yunpeng Qi,Jinming Liu,Yixin Gao,Xin Li,Xin Jin,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-ICMH is a generative image compression framework that harmonizes machine and human vision by ensuring both semantic fidelity for intelligent tasks and perceptual realism for human viewing through diffusion models and semantic consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image compression methods are optimized separately for either human perception or machine analysis tasks, but there are fundamental commonalities between these objectives. Preserving accurate semantic information is crucial for both intelligent tasks and human understanding, while perceptual quality benefits both visual appeal and semantic feature extraction.

Method: Proposes Diff-ICMH framework with: 1) Generative priors for perceptual realism, 2) Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) to guarantee semantic fidelity, 3) Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that uses image-level tags to stimulate diffusion model capabilities with minimal bit rate overhead. The system supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec without task-specific adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks while maintaining visual appeal for human perception. The framework achieves harmonization between machine and human vision objectives in image compression.

Conclusion: Diff-ICMH successfully bridges the gap between machine-oriented and human-oriented image compression by leveraging generative models and semantic consistency mechanisms, enabling a unified approach that serves both intelligent analysis tasks and human visual experience simultaneously.

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

TL;DR: TCEAD: A text-guided AI framework for automated dental implant abutment design that improves localization accuracy by 0.8%-12.85% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dental implant abutment design is time-consuming and error-prone, with inappropriate designs potentially causing complications like peri-implantitis. There's a need for automated AI-assisted design to improve efficiency and adaptability.

Method: TCEAD extends MeshMAE self-supervised learning with a text-guided localization module using CLIP text encoder. The framework pre-trains on oral scan data for better feature extraction and uses text descriptions to locate small abutment areas within larger oral scans.

Result: TCEAD achieves 0.8%-12.85% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) over mainstream methods on a large abutment design dataset, demonstrating superior localization accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed TCEAD framework shows strong potential for automated dental abutment design by effectively combining text guidance with self-supervised learning for precise abutment area localization.

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

TL;DR: Three-channel DDPM generates realistic dual-view mammograms (CC & MLO) with good cross-view consistency; sum/absolute difference channel encodings perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop synthetic mammogram generation for dataset augmentation, evaluating different channel representations for image fidelity and cross-view consistency.

Method: Fine-tuned pretrained 3-channel DDPM on 11,020 mammograms, tested three channel encodings (sum, absolute difference, zero), generated 500 synthetic pairs, evaluated with quantitative metrics (IoU, DSC, EMD, KS tests) and qualitative visual Turing test.

Result: Synthetic mammograms comparable to real images (EMD: 0.020, KS: 0.077); sum/absolute difference encodings outperformed others (p<0.001); 6-8% artifacts consistent with training data; good cross-view consistency maintained.

Conclusion: Three-channel DDPMs can generate realistic, anatomically consistent dual-view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation for medical imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

### [100] [AnoRefiner: Anomaly-Aware Group-Wise Refinement for Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22595)
*Dayou Huang,Feng Xue,Xurui Li,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoRefiner improves zero-shot industrial anomaly detection by refining patch-level anomaly maps to pixel-level using anomaly score maps, achieving up to 5.2% gain in pixel-AP metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot industrial anomaly detection methods produce coarse anomaly maps due to patch-level features from ViTs. Recent attempts to predict finer anomalies struggle with missed detections due to the gap between synthetic training anomalies and real ones. The authors observed that anomaly score maps provide complementary spatial cues missing from ZSAD's image features.

Method: Proposes AnoRefiner with two key components: 1) An anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing reliance on synthetic anomaly data; 2) A progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for refinement in the next group, compatible with any ZSAD method.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets show AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to 5.2% gain in pixel-AP metrics, with improvements directly observable in visualizations.

Conclusion: AnoRefiner effectively bridges the gap between patch-level and pixel-level anomaly detection in zero-shot industrial settings by leveraging anomaly score maps as complementary spatial cues, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and models.

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

### [101] [Leveraging Textual Compositional Reasoning for Robust Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22903)
*Kyu Ri Park,Jiyoung Park,Seong Tae Kim,Hong Joo Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORTEX is a novel framework that integrates textual cues from Vision Language Models with visual features to better capture subtle changes in image pairs for change captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change captioning methods rely solely on visual features, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack explicit structured information like object relationships and compositional semantics.

Method: CORTEX consists of three modules: 1) Image-level Change Detector for low-level visual differences, 2) Reasoning-aware Text Extraction module using VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions, and 3) Image-Text Dual Alignment module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning.

Result: The framework enables reasoning over both visual and textual features to capture changes that are ambiguous in visual features alone, enhancing change understanding through complementary textual cues.

Conclusion: Integrating textual knowledge from VLMs with visual features provides richer signals for change captioning, allowing the system to capture subtle changes through compositional reasoning that pure visual approaches miss.

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MG-Nav is a dual-scale zero-shot visual navigation framework that combines global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control using a Sparse Spatial Memory Graph and VGGT-adapter for 3D-aware feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of zero-shot visual navigation in complex environments, where agents need to navigate to visual targets without prior training in those specific scenes. Existing approaches often struggle with long-horizon planning, viewpoint diversity, and dynamic scene changes.

Method: MG-Nav uses a dual-scale framework: 1) Global planning with Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG) that aggregates multi-view keyframes and object semantics, enabling image-to-instance hybrid retrieval for waypoint planning; 2) Local control with a navigation foundation policy that switches between point-goal and image-goal modes, enhanced by VGGT-adapter for 3D-aware feature alignment; 3) Periodic re-localization to correct errors.

Result: MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks, demonstrating robustness under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-scale framework effectively unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control, providing a robust solution for zero-shot visual navigation that handles long-horizon tasks and adapts to environmental changes.

Abstract: We present MG-Nav (Memory-Guided Navigation), a dual-scale framework for zero-shot visual navigation that unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control. At its core is the Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG), a compact, region-centric memory where each node aggregates multi-view keyframe and object semantics, capturing both appearance and spatial structure while preserving viewpoint diversity. At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space. MG-Nav operates global planning and local control at different frequencies, using periodic re-localization to correct errors. Experiments on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks demonstrate that MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and remains robust under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting severely limits AI deployment in medical imaging where models need to continually adapt to new hospital data without losing established diagnostic knowledge from previous hospitals.

Method: Introduces latent drift-guided replay that quantifies representational instability via latent drift (change in internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation). Aggregates drift at patient level and stores per-patient slices with greatest multi-layer representation shift in memory buffer for replay.

Result: Evaluated on cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, the method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

Conclusion: Latent drift serves as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real-world medical settings, addressing the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting in medical AI deployment.

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models freeze MLLM encoders during training, limiting their reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to unlock MLLM's reasoning power to better handle abstract instructions and improve editing accuracy.

Method: Proposes a thinking-editing-reflection loop: 1) Thinking mechanism interprets abstract instructions using MLLM's world knowledge, 2) Editing performs the manipulation, 3) Reflection reviews results, corrects unintended manipulations, and determines stopping criteria.

Result: Significant performance improvements: ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing from Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S). Also outperforms previous open-source methods on GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Conclusion: Unlocking MLLM reasoning capabilities through thinking and reflection mechanisms significantly enhances image editing performance, demonstrating the value of integrating reasoning loops into editing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Motivation: Current remote sensing MLLMs rely on expensive, human-curated CoT data which introduces biases and limits reasoning diversity. There's a need for more efficient, unbiased geospatial reasoning approaches.

Method: Proposes GeoZero framework with two datasets: GeoZero-Instruct for supervised fine-tuning and GeoZero-Hard for reinforcement learning. Introduces Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A²GRPO) that regularizes reasoning using model's own answers to encourage diverse thinking.

Result: GeoZero surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks and fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Conclusion: GeoZero demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve effective geospatial reasoning without predefined CoT supervision, offering a more efficient and less biased alternative to current approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

TL;DR: Proposes Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss to mitigate task conflicts in unified multimodal models without model decoupling, improving both generation and understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models face inherent conflicts between understanding and generation tasks. Current solutions use model decoupling (e.g., separate encoders, MOE architectures) which can compromise the unified model's original interleave generation capability. The paper aims to address task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling.

Method: Analyzes why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying cross-modal attention behavior, observing that decoupling drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns. Proposes Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss that explicitly learns task-specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. Applied AIA to Emu3 and Janus-Pro models during SFT and post-training stages respectively.

Result: AIA loss refines cross-modal attention patterns and boosts both generation and understanding performance without requiring model decoupling. Demonstrates generalizability across different models and training stages.

Conclusion: The proposed AIA loss effectively mitigates task conflicts in unified multimodal models while preserving their interleave generation capability, offering a promising alternative to model decoupling approaches.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMM-X is a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations in medical imaging by minimizing mutual information, enabling predictions based on true causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often suffer from shortcut learning (spurious correlations), leading to poor generalization across environments. Multiple spurious correlations can coexist in medical imaging, and misclassifications can have severe consequences for patient care.

Method: MIMM-X disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. This framework enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts.

Result: Evaluated on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Conclusion: MIMM-X provides an effective framework for addressing shortcut learning in medical imaging by disentangling causal features from multiple spurious correlations, leading to more robust and generalizable models that rely on true causal relationships.

Abstract: Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

### [109] [VaMP: Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22664)
*Silin Cheng,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VaMP is a variational multi-modal prompt learning framework that generates instance-specific, uncertainty-aware prompts for vision-language models by sampling from learned posterior distributions, improving few-shot and domain generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods use fixed, shared prompts with deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation and model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. There's a need for more flexible, adaptive prompting that can personalize to individual inputs.

Method: Proposes Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) that generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution. Introduces class-aware prior from instance representation and class prototype. Formulates prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and trains end-to-end through reparameterized sampling.

Result: Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure.

Conclusion: VaMP effectively addresses limitations of fixed prompt learning by enabling sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning, leading to improved generalization in vision-language models under limited supervision settings.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

### [110] [From Illusion to Intention: Visual Rationale Learning for Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23031)
*Changpeng Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xi Chen,Junhan Liu,Taofeng Xue,Chong Peng,Donglian Qi,Fangzhen Lin,Yunfeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRL introduces visual rationalization as core reasoning primitives (visual Chain-of-Thought) and trains models end-to-end with process supervision and reward shaping to ensure visual actions meaningfully contribute to correct reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat visual actions as optional tools, creating an "illusion of thinking with images" where models appear visually grounded but actually use context-agnostic actions that don't refine perception or guide reasoning toward correct answers.

Method: Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL) reframes visual actions as core reasoning primitives (visual rationalization). It uses: (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions.

Result: ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning when trained purely with end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Visual rationalization establishes a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models that "get the right answer for the right visual reason."

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

### [112] [Decoupled DMD: CFG Augmentation as the Spear, Distribution Matching as the Shield](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22677)
*Dongyang Liu,Peng Gao,David Liu,Ruoyi Du,Zhen Li,Qilong Wu,Xin Jin,Sihan Cao,Shifeng Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Steven Hoi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the conventional understanding that Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) works primarily through distribution matching, revealing instead that CFG Augmentation is the core "engine" while Distribution Matching acts as a "regularizer."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional understanding of why DMD and its variants work so well for few-step diffusion model distillation, particularly in complex tasks like text-to-image generation where CFG is typically required.

Method: Rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective to analyze its components, followed by experimental validation showing that simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can replace the Distribution Matching term as effective regularizers.

Result: Revealed that CFG Augmentation (CA) is the primary driver of few-step distillation, not distribution matching, and that the Distribution Matching term functions mainly as a regularizer. This understanding enabled principled modifications like decoupling noise schedules, leading to performance gains.

Conclusion: The conventional understanding of DMD is incomplete; CFG Augmentation serves as the core distillation engine while Distribution Matching acts as a regularizer. This decoupling enables more principled analysis and improvements to distillation methods, as validated by adoption in the Z-Image project.

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

*Felipe Akio Matsuoka,Eduardo Moreno J. M. Farina,Augusto Sarquis Serpa,Soraya Monteiro,Rodrigo Ragazzini,Nitamar Abdala,Marcelo Straus Takahashi,Felipe Campos Kitamura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative inpainting for artifact removal in pediatric hand radiographs significantly degrades AI performance for bone age estimation and gender classification, despite appearing visually realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether generative foundation model-based inpainting for removing non-anatomical artifacts in medical images preserves clinically relevant features needed for downstream AI tasks like bone age and gender prediction.

Method: Used RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset with 200 original radiographs, generated 600 inpainted versions using gpt-image-1 with natural language prompts targeting non-anatomical artifacts. Assessed downstream performance with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation (MAE) and gender classification (AUC), plus pixel intensity distribution analysis.

Result: Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images showed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies indicating structural modifications.

Conclusion: Despite visual realism, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, highlighting the need for rigorous task-specific validation before clinical AI integration.

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

*Yiwen Zhang,Joseph Tung,Ruojin Cai,David Fouhey,Hadar Averbuch-Elor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D foundation models show emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry without training for it. A lightweight alignment scheme improves pose estimation under extreme viewpoints while maintaining depth quality. New MegaUnScene benchmark introduced for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D foundation models have advanced 3D vision, their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains unexplored. The paper investigates whether these models can handle challenging viewpoint scenarios they weren't explicitly trained for.

Method: 1) Study internal representations of 3DFMs to understand emergent extreme-view geometry capabilities. 2) Introduce lightweight alignment scheme that refines internal 3D representations by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms while keeping decoder heads frozen. 3) Create MegaUnScene benchmark with test splits for relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction.

Result: 3DFMs exhibit emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry despite no explicit training. The lightweight alignment scheme substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality.

Conclusion: 3D foundation models possess latent capabilities for extreme-view reasoning that can be enhanced with minimal parameter tuning. The MegaUnScene benchmark provides a new evaluation framework for testing 3DFMs on unseen scenes and challenging viewpoint conditions.

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. All code and data will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD), a large-scale benchmark for Indian language scene text recognition, addressing the lack of high-quality datasets for 11 Indian languages and English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indian language scene text recognition remains challenging due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, varying writing styles, and lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models, despite English scene text recognition being nearly solved.

Method: Created BSTD with over 100K words spanning 11 Indian languages and English from 6,500+ scene images across India, with meticulous annotations supporting multiple tasks: text detection, script identification, cropped word recognition, and end-to-end recognition.

Result: Evaluated state-of-the-art English models adapted for Indian languages, highlighting challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. All models and data are open source.

Conclusion: BSTD represents a significant step toward advancing Indian language scene text recognition research by providing comprehensive benchmark data and open-source resources.

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

TL;DR: Ar2Can is a two-stage framework for reliable multi-human image generation that separates spatial planning from identity rendering to prevent face duplication, identity merging, and miscounting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals.

Method: Two-stage framework: Architect module predicts structured layouts specifying where each person should appear, then Artist module synthesizes photorealistic images guided by spatially-grounded face matching reward combining Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. Two Architect variants integrated with diffusion-based Artist model, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with compositional rewards.

Result: Evaluated on MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably achieves these results using primarily synthetic data without requiring real multi-human images.

Conclusion: Ar2Can successfully addresses multi-human generation challenges through disentangled spatial planning and identity rendering, demonstrating that reliable multi-human scenes can be generated using synthetic data without real multi-human images.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Z-Image is a 6B-parameter open-source image generation model that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm, achieving SOTA results with significantly reduced computational cost compared to existing 20B-80B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-performance image generation is dominated by proprietary systems, while open-source alternatives are too large (20B-80B parameters) for practical inference and fine-tuning on consumer hardware. There's a need for efficient, accessible alternatives.

Method: Built on Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture. Uses systematic optimization across the entire model lifecycle: curated data infrastructure, streamlined training curriculum, few-step distillation with reward post-training (for Z-Image-Turbo), and omni-pre-training paradigm for editing capabilities.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or surpassing leading competitors across various dimensions. Exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering. Z-Image-Turbo offers sub-second inference on H800 GPU and runs on consumer hardware (<16GB VRAM). Full training completed in 314K H800 GPU hours (~$630K).

Conclusion: State-of-the-art image generation results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. The model demonstrates that efficient, accessible, budget-friendly generative models can rival top-tier commercial systems, with code, weights, and demo publicly released.

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceMind is a multimodal LLM for 3D spatial reasoning from RGB images alone, using camera-guided modality fusion instead of auxiliary 3D data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning tasks like distance estimation and cross-view consistency, and existing methods either require auxiliary 3D information or use shallow feature fusion with geometry encoders.

Method: Dual-encoder architecture with VGGT as spatial encoder and InternViT as 2D visual encoder. Key innovation: Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module that treats camera representation as active guiding modality, applying camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens and using camera embedding to gate fused representations.

Result: New SOTA on VSI-Bench, SQA3D, and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins, and achieving SOTA on SQA3D.

Conclusion: Camera-guided modality fusion is an effective inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence, enabling strong 3D reasoning from RGB inputs alone.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

TL;DR: Splat-SAP is a feed-forward method for novel view synthesis of human-centered scenes from sparse binocular cameras using Gaussian Splatting with pixel-wise point map reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods require dense input views and per-scene optimization, while recent feed-forward approaches still need largely overlapped views. There's a gap in handling large sparsity between input views.

Method: Two-stage learning: Stage 1 uses iterative affinity learning to transform point maps into real space for camera control. Stage 2 projects point maps from two views onto target plane, refines geometry via stereo matching, and anchors Gaussian primitives for rendering.

Result: The method improves both stability of point map reconstruction and visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering on collected multi-view human-centered data.

Conclusion: Splat-SAP enables feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering from sparse binocular cameras through robust point map reconstruction and two-stage learning, addressing the sparsity challenge in human-centered scene rendering.

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

TL;DR: REVEAL-Bench is the first reasoning-enhanced benchmark for AI-generated image detection using chain-of-evidence from expert models, and REVEAL is a forensic framework that integrates detection with expert-grounded reinforcement learning to produce verifiable reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images are becoming indistinguishable from authentic ones, threatening social trust and information integrity. Current explainable forensic methods rely on post-hoc rationalizations or surface-level pattern matching, lacking verifiable evidence chains and suffering from poor generalization.

Method: 1) Create REVEAL-Bench benchmark with chain-of-evidence from multiple lightweight expert models, recording step-by-step reasoning traces. 2) Develop REVEAL framework with expert-grounded reinforcement learning that jointly optimizes detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence using explicit forensic evidence.

Result: REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for explainable image forensics.

Conclusion: The proposed REVEAL framework addresses critical limitations in current explainable forensic methods by providing fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside detection outcomes, advancing the field of trustworthy AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes.

### [121] [Vision Bridge Transformer at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23199)
*Zhenxiong Tan,Zeqing Wang,Xingyi Yang,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViBT is a 20B/1.3B parameter Bridge Model using Transformer architecture for efficient image/video translation via data-to-data trajectories instead of noise-to-data diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models transform noise into data, which can be inefficient. Bridge Models offer a more direct approach by modeling trajectories between inputs and outputs for conditional generation tasks like image editing and video translation.

Method: 1) Scale Bridge Models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, 2) Use Transformer architecture to support large scale, 3) Propose variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training, 4) Model direct trajectories between inputs and outputs rather than noise-to-data transformations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness for image and video translation tasks, showing the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation applications.

Conclusion: Scaling Bridge Models with Transformer architecture and improved training objectives enables efficient data-to-data translation, highlighting their potential for advanced conditional generation tasks compared to traditional diffusion approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.

*Silvia Zuffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First method to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) from a single ground-based RGB image using deep learning and synthetic forest data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AGB estimation methods are labor-intensive (field measurements) or limited in dense vegetation (remote sensing). Need scalable, cost-effective forest monitoring solutions for carbon storage assessment and wildfire fuel load management.

Method: Frame AGB estimation as dense prediction task using AGB density maps (pixels represent tree biomass normalized by plot area and image area). Use synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset with realistic forest scenes, tree attributes, and segmentation masks. Compute AGB via allometric equations and train model to predict density maps, then integrate for scene-level AGB.

Result: Achieves median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m² on synthetic SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m² on real-image dataset. First method to estimate AGB directly from single RGB image.

Conclusion: Proposes scalable, interpretable, cost-effective solution for forest monitoring that enables citizen science participation and advances biomass estimation from ground-based imagery.

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining visible and thermal infrared aerial imagery with deep learning improves automated detection of great blue herons and nests, with late fusion achieving best results (93% F1 score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient wildlife monitoring methods for biodiversity conservation; combining VIS and TIR imagery can provide complementary information to improve automated detection compared to single-source approaches.

Method: Used synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery aligned with deep learning; tested early fusion (PCA fusion of image pairs) and late fusion (CART processing of VIS-only and TIR-only model detections) with YOLO11n model for great blue heron detection.

Result: Both fusion methods improved F1 scores over VIS-only model; late fusion achieved 93.0% F1 score for occupied nests (vs 90.2% VIS-only) and identified false positives with 90% recall.

Conclusion: Fusion methods improve detection but face limitations from TIR FOV and alignment constraints; very high-resolution visible sensors could be more practical for operational surveys despite fusion benefits.

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

*Mahdieh Behjat Khatooni,Mohsen Soryani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining CNNs, Vision Transformers, and BiLSTMs achieves 95.05% accuracy in predicting MCI progression to Alzheimer's using longitudinal MRI data and biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is crucial since it's irreversible. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage, but predicting which MCI patients will progress to AD remains challenging, as not all MCI cases convert to AD.

Method: Proposed an end-to-end deep learning model using ADNI data. Combines CNNs and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from MRI scans. Uses BiLSTM networks to process features from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with non-image biomarkers for temporal progression analysis, predicting cognitive status at 48 months.

Result: Achieved 95.05% average accuracy in distinguishing between stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI), outperforming existing studies and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining spatial and temporal modeling is highly effective for early Alzheimer's disease detection, showing superior performance in predicting MCI progression to AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

### [125] [Simultaneous Image Quality Improvement and Artefacts Correction in Accelerated MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23274)
*Georgia Kanli,Daniele Perlo,Selma Boudissa,Radovan Jirik,Olivier Keunen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USArt is a dual-model deep learning method that simultaneously addresses MRI acceleration (up to 5x) and artifact correction (noise/motion) in under-sampled 2D brain images with Cartesian sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition is time-consuming, especially when multiple sequences are needed or patients can't stay still. While deep learning methods exist for either acceleration (under-sampling) OR artifact correction, no approach addresses both simultaneously when these degradation factors occur together, limiting real-world performance.

Method: USArt employs a dual sub-model approach customized for 2D brain anatomical images with Cartesian sampling. It recovers high-quality images from under-sampled data while simultaneously correcting noise and motion artifacts. The method explores various under-sampling strategies, with gradient under-sampling yielding best results.

Result: The model achieves up to 5x acceleration with simultaneous artifact correction without significant degradation. Results show remarkable increase in SNR and contrast in restored images. The method demonstrates robustness in real-world settings across various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels.

Conclusion: USArt successfully addresses the gap in simultaneously handling MRI acceleration and artifact correction, showing promising performance for real-world clinical applications where both degradation factors occur together.

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with culture mixing scenarios where multiple cultural elements appear together, showing poor preservation of individual cultural identities and strong background reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In a globalized world, cultural elements frequently appear together in visual scenes, but how Large Vision-Language Models perceive these culture mixing scenarios remains underexplored. This is a critical challenge for LVLMs operating in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Method: Constructed CultureMix, a food VQA benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks. Evaluated 10 LVLMs and explored three robustness strategies including supervised fine-tuning with diverse culture mixing datasets.

Result: LVLMs show consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings, with strong background reliance (accuracy drops 14% when cultural backgrounds are added) and produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. Supervised fine-tuning substantially improves model consistency and reduces background sensitivity.

Conclusion: Culture mixing scenarios represent a critical challenge for LVLMs. The research calls for increased attention to these scenarios as a necessary step toward developing models capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

*Yiming Chen,Junlin Han,Tianyi Bai,Shengbang Tong,Filippos Kokkinos,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs lack human-like subjective perception of images (memorability, humor, aesthetics, emotion). CogIP-Bench benchmark reveals this gap, but post-training can bridge it, enabling better image generation aligned with human cognitive properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at objective image understanding (identifying objects, describing scenes) but fail to capture subjective human cognitive properties like memorability, humor, aesthetics, and emotional evocativeness.

Method: 1) Introduce CogIP-Bench benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on subjective image cognitive properties. 2) Use post-training phase to align models with human perception. 3) Integrate cognitively-aligned MLLM into image generation pipeline to guide synthesis.

Result: 1) Significant gap found between current MLLMs and human perception of subjective image properties. 2) Post-training effectively bridges this gap, enhancing alignment with human judgments. 3) Cognitive alignment transfers to downstream creative tasks, enabling generation of more memorable and visually appealing images.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark for measuring human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and demonstrates that cognitive alignment enables more human-centric AI applications, particularly in creative image generation.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC4-DViT combines text-guided diffusion for generating balanced training data with a deformable Vision Transformer for land-cover classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on aerial imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely, accurate land-cover maps are critical for environmental applications, but remote sensing classification faces challenges with scarce/imbalanced annotations and geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes.

Method: A two-part framework: 1) Generative data creation using GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced training images, and 2) DViT architecture combining DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with Vision Transformer encoder to capture both fine-scale geometry and global context.

Result: Achieved 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen's Kappa on AID dataset, outperforming ViT baseline and other models. Cross-dataset experiments showed good transferability (0.9333 OA). LLM-based evaluation confirmed DViT's attention aligns with hydrologically meaningful structures.

Conclusion: Description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping, addressing annotation scarcity and geometric distortion challenges.

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

TL;DR: LVLMs fine-tuned on synchronized driver/road camera data can generate safety-aware driving instructions, but struggle with subtle/complex event detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs focus on road-facing views for autonomous driving safety, but comprehensive safety monitoring requires processing synchronized driver-facing views to detect risky behaviors like mobile phone use while driving.

Method: Constructed a dataset with synchronized driver-facing and road-facing camera inputs, then developed and evaluated LVLMs on this dataset, including both pre-trained and fine-tuned models.

Result: Pre-trained LVLMs had limited effectiveness, but fine-tuned LVLMs could generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. However, challenges remain in detecting subtle or complex events in videos.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LVLMs on synchronized multi-view data enables safety-aware instruction generation, but further improvements are needed for detecting subtle/complex events. The findings provide valuable insights for improving LVLM-based safety systems.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Safari introduces a pose-conditioned world engine with persistent memory retrieval for generating 3D-consistent videos along challenging camera trajectories, outperforming existing methods on a new in-the-wild FPV dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world engines struggle with aggressive 6-DoF camera trajectories and complex outdoor scenes, losing long-range geometric coherence, deviating from target paths, or being overly conservative in motion.

Method: Uses pose-conditioned world memory with a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens from persistent memory, which then condition video generation along camera trajectories. Also introduces OpenSafari dataset with multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation.

Result: Substantially outperforms SOTA camera-controlled generators: reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, lower FVD than all baselines. In human study, 67.6% preferences favor Captain Safari across all axes.

Conclusion: Pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation. OpenSafari serves as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

Motivation: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), it's unclear if they are robust to contradicting modalities. The paper aims to rigorously study this fundamental question about MLLMs' cross-modal reasoning reliability.

Method: 1) Introduce MMA-Bench with videos and tasks probing model reliance on specific modalities. 2) Use black-box and white-box interpretability techniques to analyze MLLM brittleness. 3) Propose modality alignment tuning strategy to teach models when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues.

Conclusion: This work provides interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. The alignment tuning approach addresses the brittleness identified in current models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: Re-MeanFlow enables efficient one-step image generation by modeling mean velocity along rectified trajectories with just one reflow step, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based models face trade-offs: Rectified Flow needs multiple expensive reflow iterations for straight paths, while MeanFlow suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision when trained on curved flows.

Method: Proposes Rectified MeanFlow that models the mean velocity field along rectified trajectories using only a single reflow step, plus a truncation heuristic to reduce residual curvature.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Re-MeanFlow provides an efficient framework for one-step generation that eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETINA benchmark to address visual shortcuts in MKB-VQA, and proposes MIMIR model with multi-image augmentation for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MKB-VQA benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts" where query images match primary subject entities, allowing models to exploit visual cues alone without understanding multimodal knowledge.

Method: 1) Create RETINA benchmark using LLM-driven pipeline with 120k training and 2k human-curated test queries referencing secondary subjects paired with related entity images. 2) Propose MIMIR model that enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities.

Result: Existing models show significantly degraded performance on RETINA, confirming their reliance on visual shortcuts. MIMIR effectively handles RETINA challenges unlike prior single-image approaches.

Conclusion: RETINA exposes limitations of current MKB-VQA benchmarks, and MIMIR demonstrates effectiveness of multi-image augmentation for handling complex multimodal knowledge reasoning without visual shortcuts.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: SLEUTH is a multi-agent framework that improves document understanding by distilling evidence-dense multimodal context from retrieved pages, achieving state-of-the-art results on long document benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on single-page tasks but struggle with long documents where clues are scattered across pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs impairs model judgment. Existing retrieval-augmented generation still contains substantial redundancy.

Method: SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse-to-fine process: identifies key textual/visual clues, filters salient visual evidence (tables/charts), analyzes queries to devise reasoning strategies, and synthesizes distilled evidence-dense multimodal context for final prediction.

Result: When paired with advanced VLM backbones, SLEUTH consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies verify each module's effectiveness and confirm benefits of the hierarchical refinement paradigm.

Conclusion: SLEUTH is a model-agnostic, scalable framework that effectively addresses redundancy and scattered evidence issues in long document understanding through multi-agent collaboration and hierarchical refinement.

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

*Jiaye Wu,Saeed Hadadan,Geng Lin,Peihan Tu,Matthias Zwicker,David Jacobs,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOW is a neural inverse rendering framework that handles complex indoor scenes with co-located light-camera setups by modeling global illumination and addressing challenges like inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, and moving specular highlights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes suffers from reflectance-lighting ambiguity, especially with inter-reflections. Co-located light-camera setups help but introduce new challenges like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights that existing methods can't handle.

Method: GLOW integrates neural implicit surface representation with neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination. It uses joint optimization of geometry and reflectance with regularization and initialization, plus a dynamic radiance cache for lighting discontinuities and surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts.

Result: GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination setups.

Conclusion: GLOW successfully addresses the challenges of inverse rendering with co-located light-camera setups by modeling global illumination and handling complex lighting phenomena, achieving superior reflectance estimation compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

TL;DR: CoordSpeaker is a framework for generating co-speech gestures with coordinated multimodal control, addressing semantic gaps through gesture captioning and using a conditional latent diffusion model for synchronized, caption-empowered gesture synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-speech gesture generation methods are limited because they omit text-driven non-spontaneous gestures and face two key challenges: 1) semantic prior gap due to lack of descriptive text annotations in datasets, and 2) difficulty achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation.

Method: 1) First bridges semantic gap through novel gesture captioning framework using motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. 2) Proposes conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and hierarchically controlled denoiser for coordinated gesture generation.

Result: Produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker pioneers gesture understanding and captioning to tackle semantic gap in gesture generation while offering novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping, enabling comprehensive coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

*Shisir Shahriar Arif,Md. Muhtashim Shahrier,Nazmul Haque,Md Asif Raihan,Md. Hadiuzzaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework classifies pedestrian age and gender from intersection footage using CNNs, achieving 86% accuracy with ResNet50, enabling demographic monitoring for safety interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian safety is critical in congested urban intersections, especially in low/middle-income countries with multimodal traffic. Current systems lack demographic data (age/gender) that influences vulnerability, and facial recognition/high-resolution imagery aren't feasible for far-view surveillance.

Method: Proposed CNN-based framework for age/gender classification from far-view intersection footage. Uses full-body visual cues without facial recognition. Implemented ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet) and custom lightweight CNN. Tested 8 variants with different pooling strategies and optimizers on video data from 3 high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Result: ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved highest accuracy (86.19%). Custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. Both enable real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, cost-effective demographic monitoring using existing camera infrastructure. Outputs can inform intersection design, signal timing optimization, and targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups. Enables more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

TL;DR: ClearGCD improves Generalized Category Discovery by reducing shortcut learning through semantic view alignment and shortcut suppression regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: ClearGCD uses two complementary mechanisms: 1) Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations, and 2) Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones.

Result: ClearGCD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed ClearGCD framework effectively mitigates reliance on non-semantic cues in GCD, addressing prototype confusion and improving generalization while preventing forgetting of known classes.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DM³T is a novel multimodal tracking framework that reformulates feature fusion as an iterative diffusion-based alignment process between visible light and thermal infrared modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VT-MOT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal MOT integrating visible light and thermal infrared is essential for robust autonomous driving, but existing fusion methods like concatenation or addition fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between heterogeneous modalities, leading to modality conflicts and degraded tracking accuracy.

Method: Proposes DM³T framework with Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module that performs iterative cross-modal harmonization, projecting features onto a shared consistent manifold. Includes Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance unified features and Hierarchical Tracker for adaptive confidence estimation. Unifies detection, state estimation, and data association into comprehensive online tracking.

Result: Achieves 41.7 HOTA on VT-MOT benchmark, representing 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DM³T effectively addresses multimodal fusion challenges through diffusion-inspired iterative feature alignment, demonstrating superior performance for robust autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2C reframes multimodal prompt learning from optimizing static point representations to learning semantic clouds via diffusion-inspired dynamic denoising, achieving better generalization across 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal prompt learning methods are limited by optimizing single static point representations, which leads to brittleness, overfitting on base classes, and poor generalization to novel or ambiguous categories.

Method: Introduces Points-to-Clouds (P2C) framework with dual denoising: Dynamic Prompt Denoising perturbs text prompts with annealed noise to learn smoother semantic landscapes, and auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder for robust cross-modal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 datasets show consistent outperformance over strong baselines. On base-to-novel generalization benchmark, achieves Harmonic Mean of 79.7% (1.4% relative improvement over baseline).

Conclusion: Learning semantic clouds via diffusion-inspired denoising is superior to static point representations for multimodal prompt learning, enabling more robust generalization to novel and ambiguous categories.

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

Motivation: Existing methods treat text queries and video clips as black-boxes, overlooking the importance of individual words, which hinders contextual understanding in video moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks.

Method: Proposes a novel approach integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image-text scene understanding, with a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from queries and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on word relevance.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing point cloud registration methods only use geometric information, while recent RGB-D methods focus on feature fusion or improved feature learning, limiting their ability to fully exploit image information and hindering practical applicability.

Method: ViGG uses a mutual guidance strategy: (1) geometric guidance to suppress ambiguous cliques in visual-geometric combination alignment, and (2) visual-guided geometric matching that uses visual priors to determine search space for extracting high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences.

Result: The method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on 3DMatch, ScanNet, and KITTI datasets in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

Conclusion: The mutual guidance strategy provides superior robustness, making ViGG applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

TL;DR: VLMs can recognize content and emotions in artworks but struggle with abstract/symbolic images and show inconsistency in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well current vision language models can detect emotional expression in artworks, given the abstract nature of emotions in art and the need for art history expertise.

Method: Case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) with four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks, followed by qualitative expert evaluation.

Result: VLMs recognize image content well and often detect depicted emotions and their expression. Performance is best for concrete images but fails for highly abstract or symbolic images. Symbol recognition remains fundamentally difficult, and models show inconsistency in related questions.

Conclusion: Current VLMs show promising capabilities for emotion detection in artworks but have limitations with abstraction, symbolism, and consistency, indicating areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuMatC is a neural framework that learns continuous, low-rank mappings for parametric matrix operations, enabling efficient computation across parameter variations with significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional matrix operations (inversion, SVD) are performed independently for each parameter value, ignoring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along parameter dimensions, leading to redundant computations in applications like wireless communication and signal processing.

Method: NeuMatC learns an unsupervised low-rank, continuous mapping from parameters to matrix operation results using neural networks. Once trained, it computes results at arbitrary parameters using only basic operations like matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations.

Result: Experiments show over 3× speedup for parametric inversion and 10× speedup for parametric SVD compared to NumPy baseline in wireless communication applications, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: NeuMatC effectively exploits low-rankness and continuity in parametric matrix operations, significantly reducing computational redundancy while maintaining accuracy, making it promising for real-world applications with continuously varying parameters.

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data.

*Yongsen Cheng,Yuanhao Cai,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenoiseGS is a novel burst denoising framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves 250× faster inference than NeRF-based methods while handling large motion and preserving fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing burst denoising methods struggle with large motion or have prohibitive computational costs. There's a need for efficient, high-quality denoising that can handle challenging motion scenarios while preserving fine details.

Method: Leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiency for burst denoising. Introduces two key components: 1) Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss that regularizes geometry from noisy inputs using high-quality Gaussian point clouds generated from clean inputs, and 2) log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss that adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in logarithmic manner to preserve high-frequency details.

Result: Significantly exceeds state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving 250× faster inference speed.

Conclusion: DenoiseGS successfully addresses key challenges in applying feedforward Gaussian reconstruction to noisy inputs, offering an efficient and effective solution for burst denoising that outperforms existing methods while being dramatically faster.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

TL;DR: One-to-All Animation is a unified framework for character animation and image pose transfer that handles references with arbitrary layouts and spatial misalignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based character animation methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures, leaving the problem of reference-pose misalignment unsolved.

Method: The framework includes: 1) self-supervised outpainting training to handle misaligned references, 2) a reference extractor for partial visibility, 3) hybrid reference fusion attention for varying resolutions and sequence lengths, 4) identity-robust pose control to decouple appearance from skeletal structure, and 5) token replace strategy for long-video generation.

Conclusion: One-to-All Animation successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by handling spatially misaligned references and arbitrary layouts, providing a unified solution for high-fidelity character animation and pose transfer.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.

*Taeyeong Kim,SeungJoon Lee,Jung Uk Kim,MyeongAh Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLEX-Seg transforms diffusion-based data generation limitations into opportunities for robust domain generalization in semantic segmentation by exploiting inherent misalignment between generated images and masks through adaptive boundary learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, especially under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks, which traditional methods try to fix. The paper proposes to leverage this misalignment as an opportunity rather than a limitation.

Method: FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that capture boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. The framework transforms misalignment into a learning opportunity.

Result: Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich datasets respectively.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations, validating the approach of transforming limitations into opportunities.

TL;DR: RobotSeg is a foundation model for robot segmentation in images/videos that addresses challenges of robot diversity, appearance ambiguity, and structural complexity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate robot segmentation is crucial for robotic perception but remains challenging due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Current segmentation models struggle with these robot-specific challenges.

Method: Built on SAM 2 foundation model with three key innovations: 1) structure-enhanced memory associator for articulated robots, 2) robot prompt generator to eliminate manual prompts, and 3) label-efficient training strategy reducing annotation needs. Also created VRS dataset with 2.8k videos (138k frames).

Result: RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video robot segmentation, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

Conclusion: RobotSeg provides a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution for robot segmentation that addresses fundamental challenges in robotic perception, enabling applications like visual servoing, data augmentation, real-to-sim transfer, and safety monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SolarCHIP introduces contrastively pretrained visual backbones for SDO solar imaging that address multimodal sensing, weak inter-class separability, and strong intra-class variability through multi-granularity contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for solar image analysis either train task-specific encoders from scratch or use natural-image pretraining that ignores unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data, failing to address key challenges in solar imaging.

Method: Multi-granularity contrastive pretraining framework that jointly aligns: (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs for temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices for position-consistent modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across spatial locations to preserve fine-grained structure.

Result: SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet and full-disk flare classification, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited.

Conclusion: SolarCHIP provides a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor for the heliophysics community that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

*Chen Li,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with vision-language models using multi-view images and text descriptions with spatial coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based 3D scene understanding approaches use implicit alignment of 3D features with VLM embedding space, which yields suboptimal performance due to 3D data scarcity and spatial relationship complexity.

Method: Hierarchical multimodal representation that explicitly aligns with VLMs at input space using multi-view images (top-down + four directional views) and text descriptions with 3D object coordinates. Hierarchical feature aggregation from patch-level to view-level to scene-level representations.

Result: Experimental results on situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Explicit alignment at input space with hierarchical multimodal representation improves 3D scene reasoning compared to implicit feature alignment approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Yurong Qian,Zhenhong Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic SLAM framework with illumination invariance using proactive appearance normalization and reactive radiance balancing for extreme exposure conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme exposure degrades 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly harmful to tightly-coupled SLAM systems that need illumination invariance for robust performance.

Method: Two key designs: 1) Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module that proactively disentangles scene's intrinsic properties (albedo) from transient lighting, learning a standardized illumination-invariant appearance model; 2) Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) that reactively handles frames with extreme exposure, activating only when exposure is poor to guide targeted optimization without affecting normal conditions.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on public datasets in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy, showing unprecedented robustness to extreme lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The synergy between proactive invariance (IAN) and reactive correction (DRB-Loss) creates a semantic SLAM framework with exceptional robustness to extreme exposure, achieving illumination invariance while maintaining high performance across all metrics.

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlockVid introduces a novel block diffusion framework with semantic-aware sparse KV cache and Block Forcing training to generate high-quality, coherent minute-long videos, addressing error accumulation in semi-autoregressive video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) video generation methods face two main challenges: 1) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation that degrades video quality over time, and 2) lack of fine-grained benchmarks and metrics specifically designed for evaluating long-video coherence.

Method: BlockVid proposes a block diffusion framework with semantic-aware sparse KV cache to reduce memory and error propagation, Block Forcing training strategy, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to enhance temporal consistency. Also introduces LV-Bench benchmark with new coherence metrics.

Result: BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods on both VBench and LV-Bench, achieving 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: BlockVid successfully addresses key limitations in minute-long video generation through its novel architecture and training strategies, demonstrating significant improvements in video quality and coherence while providing a comprehensive benchmark for future long-video research.

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: McSc is a three-stage RL framework for aligning text-to-video generation with human preferences, addressing bias toward low-motion content through motion-corrective alignment and hierarchical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or proxy metrics, lack understanding of human preference logic, and often bias models toward low-motion content by ignoring conflicting dimensions like motion dynamics vs. visual quality.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains generative reward model with per-dimension assessments using self-critic reasoning chains; 2) Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) enables structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision; 3) Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) optimizes T2V models using RM-preferred videos while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate low-motion bias.

Result: McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic content.

Conclusion: The proposed McSc framework effectively addresses limitations in existing T2V preference alignment methods by providing robust preference modeling through hierarchical reasoning and motion-corrective optimization, resulting in better-aligned videos with improved motion dynamics.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF) for noise reduction in segmentation networks, treating convolutional features as Gaussian-distributed signal matrices and applying a low-amplitude pass filter to minimize noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise reduction is often neglected in convolutional feature processing for segmentation networks, which can cause butterfly effects that impair subsequent outcomes in the entire feature system. The authors aim to address this gap by developing a feature-level noise reduction method.

Method: The authors treat convolutional features as Gaussian-distributed feature signal matrices and propose a Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF), which is essentially a low-amplitude pass filter designed to minimize noise in feature signal inputs. They also develop a binarization equation to calculate information entropy for numerical analysis of noise reduction.

Result: Experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets validated CFF's effectiveness, demonstrating decreased noise in feature signal matrices. The binarization equation enabled numerical observation and analysis of the noise reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed CFF provides a simple and effective solution for noise reduction in convolutional features, addressing a previously neglected aspect of segmentation network processing that can significantly impact overall system performance.

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

TL;DR: MultiBanana is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-reference text-to-image generation models, addressing limitations of existing datasets by covering diverse multi-reference scenarios including varying reference counts, domain mismatches, scale mismatches, rare concepts, and multilingual text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for text-to-image generation focus on single or few reference images, failing to properly measure model capabilities in multi-reference scenarios. Current task definitions are vague and don't capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings, preventing comprehensive evaluation of model performance and identification of weaknesses.

Method: The authors introduce MultiBanana benchmark with carefully designed evaluation scenarios: (1) varying number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts, and (5) multilingual textual references. The benchmark assesses model capabilities across these diverse multi-reference conditions.

Result: Analysis of various text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. The benchmark provides standardized evaluation for multi-reference generation and editing tasks.

Conclusion: MultiBanana addresses the gap in multi-reference text-to-image evaluation by providing a comprehensive benchmark that covers diverse challenging scenarios. It will be released as an open benchmark to establish standardized fair comparison and push the boundaries of multi-reference image generation research.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is widely used for improving generation quality and condition alignment, but existing approaches are fundamentally tied to diffusion model assumptions. The authors want to extend CFG-like capabilities to visual autoregressive models without architectural changes or retraining.

Method: Uses invertible spectral transformations to preserve information while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum for controlled information reduction. Performs spectrum selection along channel dimension of internal representations, avoiding diffusion model constraints. Introduces two spectrum renormalization strategies for numerical stability during weakening process.

Result: Extensive experiments on both discrete and continuous AR models with text or class conditioning show the method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

Conclusion: The spectrum-weakening framework successfully extends classifier-free guidance capabilities to visual autoregressive models without requiring retraining, specific conditions, or architectural modifications, providing a flexible approach for both unconditional and conditional generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

Motivation: Multi-modal rendering incorporating thermal infrared imagery remains underexplored in NeRF/3DGS research, with existing approaches neglecting distinctive thermal characteristics like heat conduction and Lambertian properties.

Method: MrGS uses orthogonal feature extraction from a single appearance feature for RGB/thermal information, employs view-dependent/independent embedding strategies based on Lambertian reflectance, and integrates Fourier's law of heat conduction and Stefan-Boltzmann/inverse-square laws for physics-based thermal modeling.

Result: Experimental results show MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians needed.

Conclusion: MrGS successfully bridges the gap in multi-modal thermal-RGB reconstruction by incorporating physics-based thermal modeling into 3D Gaussian Splatting framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: JarvisEvo is a unified image editing agent that addresses instruction hallucination and reward hacking through multimodal reasoning and self-improvement, outperforming existing methods on editing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based editing models face two critical challenges: (1) instruction hallucination where text-only reasoning leads to factual errors due to information bottlenecks, and (2) reward hacking where agents exploit flaws in static reward functions during policy optimization.

Method: JarvisEvo emulates human designers with iterative editing, tool selection, evaluation, and reflection. It features: (1) interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning for better instruction following, (2) synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) for self-improvement without external rewards, and (3) integration with Adobe Lightroom for global and local fine-grained editing.

Result: On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, with a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo effectively addresses the limitations of current agent-based editing models through its multimodal reasoning and self-improvement framework, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining content fidelity during image editing tasks.

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GC-4DGS improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting for sparse input views by incorporating geometric consistency through MVS uncertainty reduction and monocular depth regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods degrade significantly with sparse input views due to incoherent 4D geometry learning, limiting practical AIoT applications like digital twins.

Method: Introduces dynamic consistency checking to reduce MVS estimation uncertainties across spacetime, and global-local depth regularization to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths.

Result: Outperforms RF-DeRF by 2.62dB and original 4DGS by 1.58dB in PSNR on N3DV and Technicolor datasets, maintaining real-time rendering and deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Conclusion: GC-4DGS successfully integrates geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting, enabling high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views while preserving efficiency for practical AIoT applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

*Hyunjin Kim,Kunho Kim,Adam Lee,Wonkwang Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex is a diffusion-based 3D mesh texturing method that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces using occlusion-aware layering and visibility control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D texturing methods perform well on visible regions but lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams.

Method: Uses occlusion-aware framework with hit levels (quantifying relative depth via multi-view ray casting) to partition mesh faces into visibility layers. Applies two-stage visibility control: progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, then textures each layer using pretrained diffusion model. Uses soft UV-space blending to seamlessly merge textures across layers based on view-dependent visibility confidence.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Operates without costly fine-tuning of pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior/interior regions.

Conclusion: GOATex addresses the interior texturing problem through occlusion-aware layering and visibility control, enabling complete, high-quality textures for both exterior and interior mesh surfaces with fine-grained appearance control.

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to quantify individual image contributions to NeRF-based 3D reconstructions, assessing which images are most valuable for reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-the-wild image sets for 3D scene reconstruction often contain images of varying quality, with occlusions and transient objects, making some images more valuable than others. There's a need to quantify individual image contributions to understand data value in applications like XR and digital media.

Method: Uses reconstruction quality metrics (PSNR and MSE) to assess each image's contribution to NeRF-based reconstructions. Validates by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Result: The method successfully quantifies individual image contributions, allowing identification of high-value vs. low-value images for 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: Provides a practical approach for data valuation in 3D reconstruction contexts, enabling more efficient training by focusing on high-contributing images and understanding data monetization potential.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REP (REplay Prompting) is a lightweight method that improves multimodal model robustness to missing modalities by caching early-layer features in modality-wise buffers and replaying them in deeper layers, with private-shared feature decoupling and task-aware dynamic initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities cause significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing methods either synthesize missing modalities (computationally expensive) or use prompt-based fine-tuning that only uses adjacent-layer features and misses long-distance contextual information that could provide tolerance to missing modalities.

Method: 1) Construct modality-wise feature buffers via residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers; 2) Employ private-shared feature decoupling where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; 3) Design task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure buffers differently for stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions.

Result: Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks show REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, with only negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: REP establishes a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

TL;DR: ENSEL is an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system that improves diagnostic accuracy for atopic dermatitis by integrating multiple deep learning models, achieving high recall and fast processing speeds under real-world clinical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of digital healthcare in South Korea and challenges in diagnosing atopic dermatitis - which relies on subjective evaluations, risks misdiagnosis, resembles psoriasis, and lacks objective diagnostic methods. Existing systems use high-quality dermoscopic images not available in real clinical settings and need better accuracy and response times.

Method: Proposed ENSEL (ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system) that integrates various deep learning models through an ensemble approach. Performance was verified using actual user-taken skin lesion images, with accuracy and response time measured on randomly sampled skin disease images.

Result: ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and processing speed of less than 1 second. The system demonstrated effectiveness in skin lesion detection under real-world clinical conditions.

Conclusion: ENSEL contributes to objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes advancement of digital healthcare by providing accurate, fast diagnostic support for conditions like atopic dermatitis using real-world clinical images rather than high-quality dermoscopic datasets.

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text instructions alone lack precision for fine-grained control over edit intensity in image editing. Current methods don't allow users to specify exact numeric scales for attribute manipulation.

Method: Introduces NumeriKontrol framework with a Numeric Adapter that encodes numeric editing scales and injects them into diffusion models. Uses task-separated design for zero-shot multi-condition editing. Trains on synthesized data from rendering engines and DSLR cameras with the CAT dataset covering diverse attribute manipulations.

Result: Achieves accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across wide range of attribute editing scenarios. Functions as a powerful interactive editing studio with precise numeric control.

Conclusion: Advances instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable manipulation through numeric scale specification, addressing the precision limitations of text-only instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MathSight benchmark reveals VLMs rely more on text than vision for math reasoning, with visual contribution decreasing as problems get harder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how much visual information actually contributes to multimodal mathematical reasoning in VLMs, as existing benchmarks don't isolate the role of images and may overstate visual understanding.

Method: Created MathSight, a university-level multimodal math reasoning benchmark with controlled visual variants (original, hand-drawn, photo-captured) and text-only conditions to isolate visual input effects.

Result: VLMs show diminishing visual contribution with increasing problem difficulty; surprisingly, Qwen3-VL without images outperforms both its multimodal variants and GPT-5.

Conclusion: Current VLMs rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than genuine visual understanding, highlighting the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance true vision-grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling DiT inference via sequence parallelism is hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models with block-wise sparse attention, due to varying sparsity across attention heads and irregular dense block distribution.

Method: Proposes db-SP with: 1) formalized sparse imbalance ratio to quantify imbalance, 2) dual-level partitioning approach for near-perfect workload balance at head and block levels, and 3) dynamic parallel degree selection for evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers.

Result: db-SP achieves 1.25x end-to-end speedup and 1.40x attention-specific speedup over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Conclusion: db-SP effectively addresses workload imbalance in sparse attention models, enabling more efficient scaling of DiT inference through sparsity-aware sequence parallelism with dynamic adaptation to changing sparsity patterns.

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

TL;DR: ACIEC proposes using affective captioning to bridge the "affective gap" in image emotion classification by generating emotional text descriptions from images and using language models for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained visual models struggle with image emotion classification due to the "affective gap" - the difficulty in capturing emotional content from visual features. Psychology research shows language can effectively eliminate this gap due to its variability and rich information.

Method: 1) Hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss for detecting emotional concepts from images. 2) Emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning to generate affective sentences. 3) Using pre-trained language models to synthesize emotional concepts and sentences for classification. 4) Contrastive loss with semantic similarity sampling to handle dataset challenges. 5) Special consideration for images with embedded text.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively bridges the affective gap and achieves superior results on multiple benchmarks compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The ACIEC framework successfully addresses the affective gap in image emotion classification by leveraging language's emotional expressiveness through affective captioning, outperforming existing methods and handling previously ignored text-embedded images.

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image denoisers rely on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, limiting their usability in clinical settings with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data.

Method: DNA-Prior integrates: (1) implicit architectural prior through deep network parameterization, and (2) explicit spectral-spatial prior with frequency-domain fidelity term and spatial regularization functional, forming a dual-domain optimization problem.

Result: Experiments across multiple modalities show DNA-Prior achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Conclusion: DNA-Prior provides a universal unsupervised denoising framework that works across modalities without external training data or modality-specific tuning, addressing limitations of supervised approaches in clinical environments.

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation methods using ray-based camera pose representations lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness, limiting their ability to faithfully follow specified camera trajectories.

Method: Introduces a dual-branch framework that mutually generates RGB and depth sequences, with a Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism for semantics-guided RGB-depth fusion. Also analyzes depth and camera pose influence across denoising stages.

Result: Achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation with over 40% reduction in camera motion errors compared to prior methods, demonstrating better disentanglement of appearance and geometry modeling.

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl effectively addresses limitations in scene understanding and geometric awareness for camera-controlled video generation through its dual-branch framework and semantic-guided alignment, enabling more faithful adherence to specified camera trajectories.

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models lack fine-grained controllability over video generation, particularly at the instance level. They rely solely on textual conditions and cannot generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations with global semantic consistency.

Method: 1) Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism to utilize instance-level grounding information; 2) Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module for connecting local instances with global semantics; 3) Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during training/inference to prevent small instance disappearance; 4) InstanceBench benchmark combining general video quality with instance-aware metrics.

Result: InstanceV achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: InstanceV successfully addresses the fine-grained controllability challenge in text-to-video generation, enabling instance-level control while maintaining global semantic consistency, representing a significant advancement in controllable video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: A multi-stage document rectification framework that progressively corrects perspective, geometric, and content distortions, with new evaluation metrics for better assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world document rectification faces challenges from extreme camera perspective variations and physical distortions. Existing methods struggle with complex transformations and evaluation protocols have limitations.

Method: A coarse-to-fine multi-stage framework: 1) global affine transformation for perspective correction, 2) geometric deformation rectification for paper curling/folding, 3) content-aware iterative process for fine-grained distortions. Also introduces new metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks with 14.1%-34.7% reduction in AAD metric, demonstrating superior real-world efficacy.

Conclusion: The progressive decomposition approach effectively handles complex document distortions, and the new evaluation metrics provide more accurate assessment of rectification quality. The method shows strong practical value for real-world applications.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chaoyunwang/ArbDR.

### [176] [Learning to Refuse: Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Hard-Irrelevant Queries in Video Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23151)
*Jin-Seop Lee,SungJoon Lee,SeongJun Jung,Boyang Li,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-RFT method improves Video Temporal Grounding by refusing hard-irrelevant queries using reinforcement fine-tuning with multiple reward objectives and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models always predict segments even for irrelevant queries, and current approaches fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant to the video content.

Method: Proposes Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework with four reward objectives: format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction. Also constructs Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset.

Result: Method effectively refuses hard-irrelevant queries across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios (hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, human-annotated RA-VTG) and shows scalability with various LVLM-based VTG models.

Conclusion: RA-RFT successfully addresses the limitation of existing VTG models by enabling them to refuse hard-irrelevant queries through reinforcement fine-tuning with comprehensive reward objectives and a specialized dataset.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

*Masaki Kawamura,Nakamasa Inoue,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PowerCLIP introduces powerset alignment for contrastive vision-language pre-training, using efficient non-linear aggregators to align image region subsets with textual parse trees, improving compositional understanding and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive vision-language models like CLIP align individual text tokens with specific image patches, but struggle to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. There's a need for better fine-grained compositional understanding in vision-language tasks.

Method: PowerCLIP uses powerset alignment that exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing loss between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. To address exponential computational complexity, they introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) while maintaining accuracy.

Result: PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, demonstrating improved compositionality and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed powerset alignment framework with efficient NLAs effectively captures multi-region compositional semantics in vision-language models, leading to superior zero-shot performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [178] [Fast Multi-view Consistent 3D Editing with Video Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23172)
*Liyi Chen,Ruihuang Li,Guowen Zhang,Pengfei Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP3DE uses video generation models for efficient 3D editing by generating consistent multi-view edits in a single forward pass, avoiding iterative 2D-3D-2D updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven 3D editing methods are slow and produce over-smoothed results due to iterative 2D-3D-2D updates that average different editing signals from multiple views.

Method: Uses pre-trained video generation models with temporal consistency priors. Conditions on a single edited view to generate other consistent views. Introduces motion-preserved noise blending for predefined camera poses and geometry-aware denoising for enhanced multi-view consistency.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D editing results in a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Conclusion: ViP3DE demonstrates that leveraging video generation models' temporal consistency priors enables efficient, high-quality 3D editing without iterative updates.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

*Yuhao Wan,Lijuan Liu,Jingzhi Zhou,Zihan Zhou,Xuying Zhang,Dongbo Zhang,Shaohui Jiao,Qibin Hou,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoWorld improves image-to-3D scene generation by using geometry models with video frames instead of single-frame depth, achieving better geometric accuracy and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video-based image-to-3D generation methods suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content due to limited geometric information from single-frame inputs.

Method: First generate consecutive video frames, then use geometry models to extract full-frame geometry features (richer than single-frame depth maps), use these as geometric conditions for video generation, and add geometry alignment loss and adaptation module for consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show GeoWorld generates high-fidelity 3D scenes from single images and camera trajectories, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: GeoWorld successfully renovates image-to-3D scene generation by leveraging geometry models with video frames, achieving superior geometric accuracy and visual quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pathology foundation models with billions of parameters and high-dimensional embeddings are computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained research and clinical settings.

Method: Pathryoshka combines multi-teacher distillation (inspired by RADIO distillation) with Matryoshka Representation Learning to create smaller models with adaptable embedding dimensions while preserving representational richness.

Result: The distilled model achieves on-par performance with much larger teachers while reducing model size by 86-92%, and outperforms comparable single-teacher distillation models by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy across ten pathology benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology foundation models by enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, benefiting the broader research and clinical community.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

TL;DR: A zero-shot quality inspection framework using real-time Digital Twins for defect detection in industrial settings, achieving 63.3% IoU scores without extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage visual quality inspection is crucial for Zero-Defect Manufacturing, but current systems are complex and require extensive data, limiting adoption in semi-controlled industrial environments.

Method: Pose-agnostic, zero-shot framework comparing real scenes against real-time Digital Twins in RGB-D space. Uses object detection and pose estimation of CAD models for efficient DT rendering, with hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection.

Result: Achieved intersection-over-union (IoU) scores up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks using simple distance measurements in semi-controlled industrial conditions, specifically in automotive axial flux motor inspection.

Conclusion: The framework provides groundwork for generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings, enabling efficient quality inspection without extensive training data requirements.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

*Milad Abdollahzadeh,Abdul Raheem,Zilong Zhao,Uzair Javaid,Kevin Yee,Nalam Venkata Abhishek,Tram Truong-Huu,Biplab Sikdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instruction tuning with limited data (7K instructions) enables open-source LLMs to achieve GPT-4o-level tabular data generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular instruction tuning focuses only on question-answering and reasoning tasks, leaving tabular data generation largely unexplored. The authors aim to address this gap while working with limited data and computational resources.

Method: Created a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, then instruction-tuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on only 7K instructions using an A100 GPU for less than 6 hours.

Result: Achieved tabular data generation performance comparable to GPT-4o, demonstrating that effective instruction tuning for tabular data generation is possible with limited resources.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with carefully curated datasets can enable open-source LLMs to match state-of-the-art commercial models in tabular data generation, even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

### [183] [Robust 3DGS-based SLAM via Adaptive Kernel Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23221)
*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Wenjie Li,Piaopiao Yu,Yurong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CB-KNN improves 3DGS-SLAM tracking by using smooth kernel rendering to make pose estimation more robust to parameter errors, rather than just optimizing rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges conventional wisdom that rendering quality alone determines tracking accuracy in 3DGS-SLAM. Argues that robustness against parameter errors is more critical for stable camera pose tracking than perfect scene representation.

Method: Proposes Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN) that adaptively modifies RGB values and locations of K-nearest neighboring Gaussians to create smoother local rendering. Uses smooth kernel strategy to make rasterization more resilient to parameter imperfections, introducing controlled blur as regularization for pose optimization.

Result: Significantly improves robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking while maintaining overall scene reconstruction quality. Demonstrates that focusing on rasterization robustness rather than just rendering error minimization leads to better tracking performance.

Conclusion: Robustness of rasterization process against parameter errors is more important than perfect rendering quality for stable 3DGS-SLAM tracking. CB-KNN provides practical solution that can be integrated into existing frameworks to enhance tracking performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations is challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios.

Method: Proposes DAONet-YOLOv8 with three key improvements: (1) Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) combining convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling; (2) occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) learning relationships between visible and occluded parts; (3) C2f-DSConv module using dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes.

Conclusion: DAONet-YOLOv8 effectively addresses challenges in tea plantation pest/disease detection through attention mechanisms, occlusion handling, and adaptive convolutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

*Lihan Li,Haofeng Zhong,Rui Bu,Mingchao Sun,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen,Yangyan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointCNN++ is a novel 3D point cloud convolution method that generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points, achieving both high geometric precision and computational efficiency through native point-based operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a trade-off: point-based methods preserve geometric precision but suffer performance issues, while voxel-based methods are efficient but lose geometric fidelity through quantization. This precision loss is critical for tasks like point cloud registration.

Method: 1) Point-centric convolution with receptive fields centered on original high-precision point coordinates. 2) Native point-based computational strategy formulated as Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem. 3) Dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel implementation.

Result: PointCNN++ uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster than point-based methods. When replacing voxel-based backbones, it significantly improves point cloud registration accuracy while being more memory-efficient and faster.

Conclusion: PointCNN++ demonstrates that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with both high fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D functionality understanding requires identifying functional elements in scenes to complete actions, but real-world data collection is expensive and time-consuming, creating a data scarcity problem.

Method: SynthFun3D generates 3D indoor scenes using a furniture asset database with part-level annotations. It reasons about action descriptions to automatically identify and retrieve 3D masks of correct functional elements, enabling large-scale generation of annotated data.

Result: User studies show improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Generated data can replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance in 3D functionality understanding tasks.

Conclusion: SynthFun3D provides an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications by generating high-quality annotated synthetic data that addresses the data scarcity problem in 3D functionality understanding.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

TL;DR: MRRE is a training-free inference-time method that enhances multilingual reasoning in LLMs/LVLMs by injecting precomputed vectors to steer non-English reasoning toward English space while preserving language consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs/LVLMs show strong English reasoning but significantly underperform in low-resource languages, creating fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing solutions are either costly (multilingual training) or resource-intensive (prompting with translation tools).

Method: MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors during inference: (1) cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors that steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space, and (2) target-language output anchoring vectors that restore target language distribution to maintain input-output consistency.

Result: Experiments across 6 LLMs/LVLMs on 4 reasoning benchmarks show MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by average 5.48% gain (up to 7.54% in low-resource languages like Thai and Swahili) while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

Conclusion: MRRE provides an effective, training-free approach to enhance multilingual reasoning capabilities without additional data or tools, addressing fairness concerns in low-resource language applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

TL;DR: Feature-based domain randomization methods (especially perceptual hashing) outperform complex GenAI approaches for sim-to-real transfer, achieving high accuracy with better resource efficiency when sufficient synthetic seed data is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the cost and effort of data generation and annotation for machine learning in industrial/robotics settings, while addressing the sim-to-real gap without requiring expert intervention.

Method: Benchmarked various domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques including feature-based methods (brightness filtering, perceptual hashing), generative AI approaches, and classical rendering. Evaluated low-level/high-level feature alignment and controlled diffusion-based DA with real-world context prompts.

Result: When sufficient variable synthetic seed data exists, simpler feature-based methods outperform GenAI approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing achieved 98% mAP50 on industrial dataset and 67% on robotics dataset. GenAI methods showed significant time overhead without improving sim-to-real performance.

Conclusion: Feature-based domain randomization methods, particularly perceptual hashing, provide efficient and effective solutions for bridging sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from synthetic-only training without the overhead of complex GenAI approaches.

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

### [189] [FACT-GS: Frequency-Aligned Complexity-Aware Texture Reparameterization for 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23292)
*Tianhao Xie,Linlian Jiang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Tiberiu Popa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACT-GS introduces adaptive texture sampling for Gaussian Splatting that allocates texture density based on local visual frequency, improving detail preservation while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture-based Gaussian Splatting uses uniform sampling grids that inefficiently allocate texture resources - high-frequency regions are under-sampled (causing blur) while smooth regions waste capacity, leading to loss of fine structural detail.

Method: FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem using a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy. It replaces uniform textures with a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density, performing non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids while maintaining real-time performance.

Result: The method recovers sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget compared to uniform texture sampling approaches, preserving real-time rendering performance.

Conclusion: FACT-GS provides an efficient frequency-aligned texture parameterization for Gaussian Splatting that improves visual quality by adaptively allocating texture sampling density according to local visual complexity.

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variational formulation for color contrast enhancement inspired by human color vision phenomenology, with efficient O(N log N) computational algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color correction algorithms inspired by human color vision are difficult to characterize in terms of image features like contrast and dispersion. The authors aim to create a more principled, mathematically rigorous approach to perceptual color enhancement.

Method: Develops a variational formulation with specific perceptual requirements, identifies three explicit functionals satisfying these requirements, uses gradient descent for optimization, and proposes a computational reduction method from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Result: The paper presents a class of functionals that satisfy all perceptual requirements, identifies three specific functionals of basic interest, and demonstrates computational efficiency improvements through algorithmic optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed variational approach provides a mathematically principled framework for perceptual color enhancement with improved computational efficiency, bridging the gap between human color perception models and practical image processing algorithms.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Markov-VAR reformulates visual autoregressive modeling as a non-full-context Markov process using Markovian Scale Prediction with a sliding window to compress previous scales, achieving better performance with significantly reduced memory consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-context dependency in Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models causes computational inefficiency and high overhead, hindering practicality and scalability despite facilitating stable representation learning.

Method: Reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process (Markov-VAR) using Markovian Scale Prediction: treat each scale as a Markov state, introduce a sliding window to compress previous scales into a compact history vector, and combine with Markov state to create a dynamic state that evolves under Markov process.

Result: Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% on ImageNet (256×256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024×1024) compared to original VAR, while being simpler and more effective.

Conclusion: Markov-VAR provides an efficient and effective foundation for visual autoregressive generation and downstream tasks by addressing computational limitations of full-context VAR while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Computer vision pipeline using YOLOv11 and PaddleOCR to digitize vital signs from bedside monitor screens in low-resource healthcare settings, achieving over 98.9% accuracy for core parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource healthcare settings often have standalone bedside monitors without network connectivity, creating an interoperability gap that prevents integration of physiological data into EHR systems. Replacing hardware is costly, so a cost-effective solution is needed.

Method: Hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for monitor and ROI localization with PaddleOCR for text extraction. Includes geometric rectification module to standardize screen perspective across variable camera angles and lighting conditions before character recognition.

Result: Evaluated on 6,498 images from open-source corpora and real-world ICUs in Vietnam. Achieved 99.5% mAP@50-95 for monitor detection, 91.5% for vital sign ROI localization, and >98.9% end-to-end extraction accuracy for heart rate, SpO2, and arterial blood pressure.

Conclusion: Lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured screen data into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource healthcare settings without costly hardware replacement.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

Motivation: Real-world driving data lacks diversity in safety-critical and out-of-distribution scenarios, limiting autonomous driving system robustness and generalization.

Method: Uses neural rendering with reactive environments to synthesize multi-view observations from perturbed ego trajectories, plus pseudo-expert trajectory generation for action supervision. Employs co-training on real and simulated data.

Result: Significant improvements in planning methods: +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest benchmarks. Policy improvement scales smoothly with simulation data alone, without extra real-world data.

Conclusion: SimScale effectively addresses data diversity limitations in autonomous driving through scalable simulation, revealing crucial design insights for sim-real learning systems.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Conclusion: DEAL-300K dataset and proposed framework establish practical foundation for future DIML research, addressing the challenge of localizing realistic diffusion-based image edits.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

TL;DR: VQRAE is a unified tokenizer that produces continuous semantic features for image understanding and discrete tokens for visual generation within a single framework, achieving competitive performance across understanding, generation, and reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with unifying understanding, generation, and reconstruction representations in a single tokenizer. Previous approaches use separate encoders or contrastive losses, but there's a need for a unified representation that handles both continuous semantic features for understanding and discrete tokens for generation.

Method: VQRAE (Vector Quantization Representation AutoEncoder) builds on pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder. It uses a two-stage training strategy: 1) freeze encoder and learn high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction, 2) jointly optimize encoder with self-distillation constraints. This produces continuous semantic features for understanding and discrete tokens for generation.

Result: VQRAE achieves competitive performance on visual understanding, generation, and reconstruction benchmarks. The semantic VQ codebook achieves 100% utilization ratio at 1536 dimensions, showing promising scaling properties in autoregressive paradigms due to its discrete token advantages.

Conclusion: VQRAE successfully unifies multimodal understanding, generation, and reconstruction in a single tokenizer, demonstrating that high-dimensional semantic codebooks outperform previous low-dimensional approaches and enabling a unified representation framework for vision tasks.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

Motivation: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering that distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing terrestrial-trained trackers fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations.

Result: MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220), improving Success AUC by up to 6%, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

Conclusion: The physics-informed framework MANTA successfully addresses underwater tracking challenges by integrating representation learning with tracking design, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across diverse underwater conditions.

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V and I2V models lack explicit motion representations separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators who need motion transfer capabilities.

Method: Proposes DisMo paradigm that learns abstract motion representations directly from raw video data using image-space reconstruction objective. The representation is generic and independent of static information like appearance, object identity, or pose. Can be combined with existing video generators via lightweight adapters.

Result: Enables open-world motion transfer across vastly different categories without object correspondences. Outperforms state-of-the-art video representation models like V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on Something-Something v2 and Jester benchmarks. Maintains motion fidelity and prompt adherence better than prior methods.

Conclusion: DisMo provides a novel motion representation that disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate motion transfer and serving as effective features for downstream motion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 represents a new paradigm for instruction-driven interaction in generative game world modeling, overcoming limitations of rigid action schemas and enabling semantically rich user control.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Conclusion: Object-centric data synthesis methods effectively address the data scarcity problem for novel object detection, providing practical solutions for extending detection capabilities to new categories with limited training data.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

TL;DR: VGT (Visual Generation Tuning) is a novel paradigm that unlocks visual generation capabilities in existing vision-language models through efficient tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results in both image reconstruction and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, it's unclear whether their representations contain inherent potential for visual generation. The paper aims to explore whether VLMs optimized for understanding tasks can be adapted for generation without extensive retraining.

Method: VGT-AE aligns semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with latent representations of pixel decoders, avoiding entangled pixel-level VAEs. This enables efficient visual generation tuning that significantly reduces alignment costs and accelerates convergence (20x speedup) in autoregressive modeling of continuous space.

Result: Achieves 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at 28x compression ratio in image reconstruction (outperforming specialized VAEs). In visual generation: 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench (state-of-the-art among autoregressive models). Shows 20x convergence speedup.

Conclusion: VGT demonstrates that pretrained VLMs harbor inherent visual generation potential that can be unlocked through efficient tuning. The approach is versatile for endowing any VLM with generation capabilities, paving the way for next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: AnyTalker is a multi-person video generation framework that uses an extensible multi-stream architecture with identity-aware attention to drive multiple identities with coherent interactivity, trained primarily on single-person videos with minimal multi-person data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven multi-person talking video generation methods face challenges due to high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and difficulty in driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity.

Method: Proposes AnyTalker with extensible multi-stream processing architecture, extends Diffusion Transformer's attention block with identity-aware attention mechanism to iteratively process identity-audio pairs, and uses training pipeline that depends primarily on single-person videos with only a few real multi-person clips for interactivity refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability. Also contributes targeted metric and dataset for evaluating multi-person video naturalness and interactivity.

Conclusion: AnyTalker effectively addresses multi-person video generation challenges by enabling arbitrary scaling of drivable identities while minimizing data collection costs through innovative architecture and training approach.

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video CoM introduces interactive video reasoning where models actively manipulate videos through iterative visual actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat video as static context, creating a semantic bottleneck where models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning for fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding tasks.

Method: Proposes Interactive Video Reasoning paradigm with Video CoM model using Chain of Manipulations (CoM) for iterative visual actions. Uses Video CoM Instruct dataset (18K samples) for instruction tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with step-level reasoning rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 3.6% average improvement over SOTA on nine video reasoning benchmarks, trained on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO samples (significantly fewer than comparable models). Reasoning-aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: Interactive Video Reasoning transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos" through iterative visual manipulations, overcoming limitations of passive video understanding paradigms.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video R2: A reinforcement learning approach that improves temporal alignment and reasoning consistency in video understanding models by addressing issues of logical inconsistency and weak visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs for video reasoning generate convincing but often logically inconsistent reasoning traces that are weakly grounded in visual evidence, relying too heavily on linguistic priors rather than actual visual content.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning approach combining timestamp-aware supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR) to enhance temporal precision and reasoning consistency.

Result: Video R2 achieves consistently higher Think Answer Consistency (TAC), Video Attention Score (VAS), and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and reasoning coherence.

Conclusion: Improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding, with the model, code, and dataset being open-sourced.

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes fluid antenna system (FAS)-enabled UAV relaying networks in finite blocklength regime, deriving BLER expressions, asymptotic analysis, and proposing energy-efficient optimization with practical overhead considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a comprehensive performance analysis framework for FAS-enabled UAV relaying networks operating under practical finite blocklength constraints, addressing both theoretical characterization and practical energy efficiency optimization while considering realistic operational overheads.

Method: The method involves: 1) Deriving closed-form BLER expressions using eigenvalue-based approximation of spatially correlated UAV-to-user links with Nakagami-m fading, 2) Conducting high-SNR asymptotic analysis to reveal diversity order, 3) Formulating energy efficiency maximization problem accounting for FAS port selection overhead, and 4) Proposing hierarchical algorithm for joint parameter optimization.

Result: Results show: 1) FAS provides substantial power gains but with operational overhead trade-offs, 2) Different optimal number of ports for rural vs urban environments, 3) Fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies required for LoS-dominant rural vs probabilistic NLoS urban scenarios, 4) Validated analysis through extensive numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications, highlighting the critical trade-off between FAS benefits and operational overhead, and demonstrating environment-dependent optimization strategies for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework for the performance analysis of fluid antenna system (FAS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying networks operating in the finite blocklength regime. Our contribution lies in establishing a rigorous methodology for characterizing system reliability under diverse propagation environments. Closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER) are derived by employing a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation of the spatially correlated UAV-to-user link, whose underlying independent diversity components are modeled as Nakagami-$m$ fading. This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments. This work provides both foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications.

*Alessandro Nordio,Alberto Tarable,Francisco J. Escribano*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes two efficient IRS configuration techniques for ultrawideband downlink scenarios that exploit beam split effects through localized optimization over the IRS surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IRS are needed to overcome line-of-sight blocking in high frequency wireless scenarios, but current designs struggle with large bandwidths due to beam split dispersion effects. There's a need for practical IRS implementations that can handle ultrawideband signals effectively.

Method: Two configuration techniques based on localized optimization over the IRS surface, adapted for ultrawideband downlink scenarios. These techniques exploit the beam split effect while considering the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum.

Result: Simulations across different geometrical setups and signal spectra show the proposed techniques achieve increased signal power at the receiver compared to classical narrowband-based solutions or global optimization approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed localized optimization techniques effectively address beam split dispersion in ultrawideband IRS scenarios, outperforming existing methods by better exploiting frequency-dependent characteristics of wideband signals.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have become the subject of many current research efforts, as the ongoing wireless spectrum crunch has made the need to open higher frequency bands a priority. IRS are one of the alternatives proposed to overcome the problem of line-of-sight blocking in very high frequency wireless scenarios. The current state-of-the-art shows the difficulty of implementing practical IRS designs able to redirect large signal bandwidths, prone to the so-called beam split (BS) dispersion effect. In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface.

TL;DR: A flexible beamforming framework for 2D planar fluid antenna arrays that transforms beam-pattern synthesis into a sparse regression problem, solved via compressive sensing with FFT and phase retrieval for improved reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid antenna systems offer spatial diversity and resolution within fixed apertures for next-gen wireless. Both narrow and broad beam patterns are needed in practical networks, requiring flexible beamforming capabilities.

Method: Established unified framework connecting beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. Formulated as sparse regression problem solved with tailored compressive sensing algorithm using FFT. Added iterative FFT-based phase retrieval for physically consistent phase modeling.

Result: Simulations show fluid antennas significantly outperform conventional fixed arrays in beam-pattern reconstruction accuracy. The phase refinement procedure has low complexity (one FFT + one inverse FFT per iteration) and rapid convergence.

Conclusion: Fluid antennas demonstrate potential for high-resolution adaptive beamforming in future wireless systems, with the proposed framework enabling flexible beamforming through efficient computational methods.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems encompass a broad class of reconfigurable antenna technologies that offer substantial spatial diversity for various optimization objectives and communication tasks. Their capability to enhance spatial resolution within a fixed physical aperture makes fluid antennas particularly attractive for next-generation wireless deployments. In this work, we focus on the beamforming problem using a two-dimensional planar fluid antenna array. Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. The resulting formulation transforms beam-pattern reconstruction into a sparse regression problem, which is addressed using a tailored compressive sensing algorithm designed to operate efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, to ensure physically consistent phase modeling in the desired beam, we introduce an iterative FFT-based phase retrieval method. Owing to its structure, the proposed phase-refinement procedure exhibits low computational complexity and rapid convergence, requiring only one FFT and one inverse FFT per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flexible beamforming framework. Compared with conventional fixed-array architectures, fluid antennas exhibit significantly improved beam-pattern reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their potential for high-resolution and adaptive beamforming in future wireless systems.

*Hongwei Zhu,Xuantai Wu,Jingjie Lv,Qinshan Zhang,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper constructs block MDS LDPC codes that combine the block MDS property with no 4-cycles in Tanner graphs, achieving both excellent random error correction and burst error correction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create codes that possess both the block MDS property (like MDS array codes for burst error correction) and the 4-cycle-free Tanner graph structure (like LDPC codes for iterative decoding near Shannon limit), addressing limitations of existing codes where these properties don't coexist.

Method: Two construction approaches: 1) Using punctured circulant permutation matrices over F₂ to generate block MDS codes, and 2) Using circulant matrices with column weight >1 (CM(t)) to construct block MDS LDPC codes. Also provides Moore determinant formula for CM(t)s and sufficient conditions to avoid 4-cycles in Tanner graphs.

Result: The constructed block MDS LDPC codes show enhanced random-error-correction compared to existing codes at similar length and rate, while also effectively combating burst errors when considered as array codes. The paper also proves non-existence of binary block MDS CPM-QC LDPC codes.

Conclusion: The paper successfully constructs binary block MDS LDPC codes that combine the advantages of both MDS array codes and LDPC codes, providing superior error correction for both random and burst errors, with both construction methods applicable to binary fields.

Abstract: Low density parity check (LDPC) codes, initially discovered by Gallager, exhibit excellent performance in iterative decoding, approaching the Shannon limit. MDS array codes, with favorable algebraic structures, are codes suitable for decoding large burst errors. The Blaum-Roth (BR) code, an MDS array code similar to the Reed-Solomon (RS) code but has a parity-check matrix prone to $4$-cycles. Fossorier proposed constructing quasi-cyclic LDPC codes from circulant permutation matrices but are not MDS array codes. This paper aims to construct codes that possess both the block MDS property and have no $4$-cycles in the Tanner graph of their parity-check matrices, namely the so-called block MDS LDPC codes. Non-binary block MDS QC codes were first constructed by [Tauz {\it et al. }IEEE ITW, 2025] using circulant shift matrices. We first generate a family of block MDS codes over $\F_2$ from punctured circulant permutation matrices. Second, we construct a family of block MDS LDPC codes from circulant matrices with column weight $> 1$ (CM$(t)$). Additionally, we present the Moore determinant formula for CM$(t)$s and a sufficient condition to avoid $4$-cycles in CM\((t)\)-QC LDPC codes' Tanner graphs for $t> 1$. We also point out the non-existence of binary block MDS CPM-QC LDPC codes. Compared to the codes constructed in [Li {\it et al. }IEEE TIT, 2023] and [Xiao {\it et al. }IEEE TCOM, 2021], our block MDS LDPC codes show enhanced random-error-correction at a similar code length and rate. Meanwhile, these codes can effectively combat burst errors when considered as array codes. Both of our two types of constructions for block MDS LDPC codes are applicable to the scenario of the binary field.

### [210] [Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Conditioning Under Extended Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22375)
*Boning Yu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Bayesian conditioning aligns with Maximum Entropy when extending probability spaces to accommodate new information, but there's debate about whether this alignment is trivial or poses fundamental challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine when Bayesian conditioning aligns with Maximum Entropy, particularly when new information doesn't correspond to events in the original probability space, requiring space extension.

Method: Analyzes Skyrms' approach of extending probability spaces via product spaces to make new information events, and critiques from Seidenfeld using Friedman and Shimony's result.

Result: Argues that Friedman and Shimony's result is either a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach or poses a universal challenge to any space extension method.

Conclusion: If the second interpretation is correct, Bayesian conditioning cannot accommodate information beyond the original outcome space's probability space.

Abstract: This paper examines the conditions under which Bayesian conditioning aligns with Maximum Entropy. Specifically, I address cases in which newly learned information does not correspond to an event in the probability space defined on the sample space of outcomes. To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces. Accepting (2) would imply that Bayesian conditioning is incapable of accommodating information beyond the probability space defined on the original outcome space.

*Shuaishuai Han,Emad Alsusa,Arafat Al-Dweik*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Analysis of how localization errors affect symbol error rate in drone communication systems using ZF and MMSE equalizers, with derived approximations showing ZF is more sensitive to angle errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how localization inaccuracy impacts communication performance in drone-based systems, specifically evaluating the effects on ZF and MMSE equalizers in pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization systems.

Method: Adopted a PASCAL system with multiple drones transmitting to a BS, which estimates location parameters to reconstruct channel matrix. Used hybrid approximation method (Neumann + Taylor approximations) to derive tightly approximated SER expressions for ZF and MMSE equalizers.

Result: Derived closed-form SER approximations showing: 1) SER of each drone affected by all drones' localization errors, 2) ZF unaffected by range estimation errors while MMSE is affected, 3) Both most sensitive to angle estimation errors, 4) ZF highly sensitive to localization errors and can perform worse than MRC under significant errors.

Conclusion: Localization errors significantly impact communication performance, with ZF being particularly vulnerable to angle estimation errors. The analysis provides important design insights for drone communication systems using simultaneous communication and localization.

Abstract: In this paper, a symbol error rate (SER) analysis is provided to evaluate the impact of localization inaccuracy on the communication performance under Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) equalizers. Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors. Numerical simulation results verify our findings and also validate the accuracy of the analysis across a wide range of system parameters.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: TransCoder: A transformer-based neural transmission scheme that enhances reliability of existing error-correcting codes with comparable computational complexity to traditional decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based decoders show promise for improving ECC reliability but have high computational complexity that prevents practical deployment. There's a need for solutions that enhance existing ECCs without excessive computational overhead.

Method: TransCoder uses transformer architecture as a code-adaptive neural module that can be flexibly implemented at transmitter, receiver, or both. It employs iterative decoding with a block attention mechanism, processing both noisy channel information and updates from conventional ECC decoders.

Result: TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance across various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, Turbo) and channel conditions while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Particularly effective for longer codes (>64 block length) and lower code rates.

Conclusion: TransCoder establishes a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices by enhancing existing ECCs with neural processing while avoiding the high computational complexity of pure neural decoders.

Abstract: Reliable communication over noisy channels requires the design of specialized error-correcting codes (ECCs) tailored to specific system requirements. Recently, neural network-based decoders have emerged as promising tools for enhancing ECC reliability, yet their high computational complexity prevents their potential practical deployment. In this paper, we take a different approach and design a neural transmission scheme that employs the transformer architecture in order to improve the reliability of existing ECCs. We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length >64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity). The results establish TransCoder as a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coherent FSO communication is crucial for high-capacity wireless networks, but theoretical analysis of adaptive MQAM over terrestrial FSO channels with turbulence and pointing errors remains limited.

Method: First derive spectral efficiency limit of adaptive unconstrained MQAM over gamma-gamma turbulence with pointing error, then evaluate performance using only six square MQAM constellations.

Result: Adaptive transmissions with just six square MQAM constellations perform close to theoretical limit (within 0.10-0.12 bits/s/Hz) across wide range of SNR and channel conditions.

Conclusion: Practical adaptive MQAM with limited constellation sets can achieve near-optimal spectral efficiency for FSO communication, making it feasible for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Coherent free-space optical (FSO) communication is recognized as a key enabler for ultra-high-capacity fronthaul and backhaul links in next-generation wireless networks. Spectrally efficient $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) formats are well-suited for these links. However, theoretical analyses of adaptive MQAM transmissions over terrestrial FSO channels remain limited. In this letter, we first derive the spectral efficiency limit of adaptive unconstrained MQAM over gamma-gamma turbulence with pointing error. We then show that adaptive transmissions using only six square MQAM constellations performs close to the theoretical limit (within $0.10$-$0.12$ bits/s/Hz) across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and channel conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create fair data representations when sensitive attributes are latent and not directly accessible, ensuring statistical parity while maintaining task utility and controlling compression rate.

Method: Uses point-wise χ² statistical parity constraint instead of mutual information, assumes Markov chains S-X-Y and T-X-Y, approximates KL-divergence via information geometry for small ε, transforms fairness design into quadratic optimization with closed-form solutions based on singular value decomposition.

Result: Develops low-complexity fairness designs using maximum singular values/vectors, provides closed-form solutions under certain constraints, and obtains computational lower bounds when closed-form solutions aren't available.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient fair representation design with theoretical guarantees and practical computational feasibility, validated through numerical comparisons with optimal solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation under a bounded point-wise statistical (demographic) parity constraint. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\in\cal Y$, we have $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\leq ε$. In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \leq r$. Finally, $Y$ satisfies the point-wise bounded statistical parity constraint $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\leq ε$. When $ε$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information. To design the representation $Y$, we utilize this approximation and show that the main complex fairness design problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has simple closed-form solution under certain constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity. Here, we provide simple fairness designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix. Finally, in a numerical example we compare our obtained results with the optimal solution.

### [215] [Leveraging Channel Knowledge Map for Multi-User Hierarchical Beam Training Under Position Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22902)
*Xu Shi,Haohan Wang,Yashuai Cao,Hengyu Zhang,Sufang Yang,Jintao Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses location uncertainty and integrates partial position info with CKM, featuring hierarchical strategies for single-user and correlation-driven schemes for multi-user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CKM faces practical challenges: user location is typically unavailable before beam training, limiting CKM utility, and the interplay between CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies hasn't been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: For single-user: reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy integrating partial position info and CKM, modeling UE position uncertainty as pruned binary search tree with optimal hierarchical searching strategy and low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme. For multi-user: correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme exploiting sidelobe gains from inter-user interference for overhead reduction.

Result: Simulations validate superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CKM limitations in practical beam training applications, providing efficient solutions for both single-user and multi-user scenarios with reduced overhead and improved performance.

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) emerges as a promising framework to acquire location-specific channel information without consuming wireless resources, creating new horizons for advanced wireless network design and optimization. Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams. Simulations validate the superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training.

### [216] [Decoding Trombetti-Zhou codes: a new syndrome-based decoding approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23202)
*Chunlei Li,Angelica Piccirillo,Olga Polverino,Ferdinando Zullo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A new syndrome-based decoding algorithm for Trombetti-Zhou MRD codes using F_q^n-generator and parity-check matrices, reducing decoding to Gabidulin codes for t < (d-1)/2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trombetti-Zhou codes are F_q^n-linear MRD codes over F_q^{2n}, but not fully linear over the larger field, making traditional syndrome-based decoding challenging due to lack of proper parity-check matrices.

Method: Introduce F_q^n-generator and parity-check matrices for F_q^n-linear rank-metric codes, construct these for Trombetti-Zhou codes using trace almost dual basis, and develop syndrome-based decoding that converts to Gabidulin code decoding for t < (d-1)/2 or reduces to rank determination for t = (d-1)/2.

Result: Successfully developed a syndrome-based decoding algorithm for Trombetti-Zhou MRD codes that works for error rank weight t ≤ (d-1)/2, with complexity analysis provided.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical decoding approach for Trombetti-Zhou MRD codes by introducing appropriate F_q^n-linear algebraic structures and connecting their decoding to established Gabidulin code decoding techniques.

Abstract: In 2019, Trombetti and Zhou introduced a new family of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed.

### [217] [Efficient Estimation of Sum-Parameters for Multi-Component Complex Exponential Signals with Theoretical Cramer-Rao Bound Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23318)
*Huiguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Novel framework for multicomponent exponential signal estimation using low-dimensional sum-parameters to avoid permutation ambiguity and computational complexity, with efficient global estimation method approaching Cramer-Rao bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multicomponent exponential signal estimation faces challenges: permutation ambiguity when components are numerous, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. Need a simpler approach that captures global signal characteristics without these problems.

Method: Introduces low-dimensional sum-parameters: sum of amplitudes, power-weighted frequency, and phase-related sum. These capture essential global characteristics while avoiding permutation ambiguities. Develops Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) that leverages these sum-parameters and derives exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for both deterministic and stochastic signal models.

Result: Frequency sum-parameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while benefiting from power pooling across all components. EGEM demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across wide SNR ranges, outperforming Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Simulations with 2000 Monte-Carlo trials show EGEM approaches theoretical bounds even with small sample sizes (250 observations).

Conclusion: The sum-parameter framework provides an effective solution to multicomponent exponential signal estimation problems, avoiding traditional challenges while achieving near-optimal statistical performance. EGEM offers practical advantages over existing methods and closely approaches theoretical performance limits.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of parameter estimation for multicomponent complex exponential signals, commonly known as sums of cisoids. Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations.

### [218] [Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406)
*Mohamed Nomeir,Alptug Aytekin,Lei Hu,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Quantum-enhanced private distributed matrix multiplication reduces server requirements using entanglement and quantum channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum resources (entanglement and quantum channels) to improve the efficiency of private distributed matrix multiplication by reducing the number of servers needed while maintaining privacy constraints.

Method: Extends classical PDMM to quantum setting with entangled servers and quantum channels. For high-privacy regime: defines feasibility condition for GASP codes, addresses when unsatisfied via privacy-dimension relations and new quantum-compatible codes. For low-privacy regime: adapts feasibility condition to CAT/DOG codes and proposes additional quantum codes.

Result: Developed quantum feasibility conditions for existing classical codes (GASP, CAT, DOG) and created new quantum-compatible code families for both high and low privacy regimes when classical codes are infeasible.

Conclusion: Quantum resources enable more efficient private distributed matrix multiplication with reduced server requirements, with specific feasibility conditions and new code constructions for different privacy regimes.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.
  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.
  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for roughly 30\% of warming since pre-industrial times. A small number of large point sources account for a disproportionate share of emissions, creating an opportunity for substantial reductions by targeting relatively few sites. Detection and attribution of large emissions at scale for notification to asset owners remains challenging. Here, we introduce MARS-S2L, a machine learning model that detects methane emissions in publicly available multispectral satellite imagery. Trained on a manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images, the model provides high-resolution detections every two days, enabling facility-level attribution and identifying 78\% of plumes with an 8\% false positive rate at 697 previously unseen sites.

*Chi Zhang,Lin Wang*

TL;DR: PISNN framework combines physics-informed learning with spiking neural networks for energy-efficient, physically-consistent edge predictions using novel C-LIF neurons and CFQ strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices are critical for next-gen embodied AI systems, but current PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws, while naive SNN conversions degrade physical fidelity.

Method: Introduces Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework with Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neurons that structurally guarantee local mass preservation, and Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy that redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux to learn time-invariant physical evolution operators.

Result: PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks including 1D heat equation and 2D Laplace's Equation, accurately simulating system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design - a feat challenging for conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust framework for fusing scientific computing rigor with neuromorphic engineering efficiency, paving the way for complex, long-term, energy-efficient physics predictions for intelligent systems.

Abstract: Real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices is critical for the next generation embodied AI systems, yet it remains a major challenge. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs. This work establishes a robust framework for fusing the rigor of scientific computing with the efficiency of neuromorphic engineering, paving the way for complex, long-term, and energy-efficient physics predictions for intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DINR addresses spectral bias in INRs by modeling feature evolution as continuous-time dynamical systems rather than discrete layers, improving high-frequency detail capture and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) suffer from spectral bias that limits their ability to capture high-frequency details in visual and geometric signals. Existing approaches don't fully address this fundamental challenge.

Method: DINR treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system instead of a discrete stack of layers. This dynamical formulation enables richer, more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature evolution, with regularization of the underlying dynamics complexity.

Result: Theoretical analysis using Rademacher complexity and Neural Tangent Kernel shows DINR enhances expressivity and improves training dynamics. Experiments on image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression demonstrate more stable convergence, higher signal fidelity, and stronger generalization than conventional static INRs.

Conclusion: DINR provides a principled framework that mitigates spectral bias in INRs through dynamical systems modeling, offering better expressivity-generalization tradeoffs and superior performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a powerful continuous framework for modeling complex visual and geometric signals, but spectral bias remains a fundamental challenge, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details. Orthogonal to existing remedy strategies, we introduce Dynamical Implicit Neural Representations (DINR), a new INR modeling framework that treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system rather than a discrete stack of layers. This dynamical formulation mitigates spectral bias by enabling richer, more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature evolution. Theoretical analysis based on Rademacher complexity and the Neural Tangent Kernel demonstrates that DINR enhances expressivity and improves training dynamics. Moreover, regularizing the complexity of the underlying dynamics provides a principled way to balance expressivity and generalization. Extensive experiments on image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression confirm that DINR delivers more stable convergence, higher signal fidelity, and stronger generalization than conventional static INRs.

*Edoardo Legnaro,Sabrina Guastavino,Francesco Marchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that replaces softmax with geometric thresholds on simplex, enabling post-training optimization via threshold tuning and introducing ROC clouds for multiclass evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multiclass classification uses argmax on softmax outputs, which lacks the ability to tune thresholds like in binary classification. The authors want to enable threshold tuning for multiclass problems to refine network predictions after training.

Method: Replace probabilistic interpretation of softmax with geometric interpretation on multidimensional simplex. Use multidimensional thresholds for classification decisions. Introduce ROC clouds for multiclass ROC analysis and Distance From Point (DFP) score to summarize performance.

Result: Multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. The proposed framework allows a posteriori optimization of classification scores through threshold tuning, refining prediction capabilities of any trained network.

Conclusion: The threshold-based framework provides a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest curves and enables threshold tuning for multiclass classification similar to binary settings, leading to measurable performance gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained classification network an \textit{a posteriori} optimization of the classification score by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting, thus allowing for a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network. Our experiments show indeed that multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. Moreover, we derive a multiclass ROC analysis based on \emph{ROC clouds} -- the attainable (FPR,TPR) operating points induced by a single multiclass threshold -- and summarize them via a \emph{Distance From Point} (DFP) score to $(0,1)$. This yields a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest (OvR) curves and aligns with the observed tuning gains.

*Ethan Hsu,Harry Chen,Chudi Zhong,Lesia Semenova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rashomon sets (multiple near-optimal ML models) create a trade-off: they enable reactive robustness against attacks and stability under distribution shifts, but increase privacy risks through information leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ML pipelines produce multiple near-optimal models (Rashomon sets), but their impact on trustworthiness aspects like robustness and privacy is not well understood. The paper aims to characterize how this multiplicity reshapes key trustworthiness considerations.

Method: Theoretical analysis combined with empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models to examine how Rashomon sets affect robustness and privacy. The research investigates individual-model properties vs. set-level diversity effects.

Result: Sparse interpretable models preserve privacy but are fragile to attacks. Rashomon set diversity enables reactive robustness (other models remain accurate when one is attacked) and stability under distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage as more models provide richer views of training data.

Conclusion: Rashomon sets play a dual role in trustworthy ML: they serve as a resource for robustness and stability, but also pose privacy risks through increased information leakage. The paper characterizes this robustness-privacy trade-off inherent in model multiplicity.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines rarely produce a single model; instead, they produce a Rashomon set of many near-optimal ones. We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage, as disclosing more near-optimal models provides an attacker with progressively richer views of the training data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models, we characterize this robustness-privacy trade-off and highlight the dual role of Rashomon sets as both a resource and a risk for trustworthy ML.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across diverse sectors has significantly enhanced operational efficiency, yet concurrently elevated cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to increased exposure to cyber threats. Given the limitations of traditional signature-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS) in identifying emerging and zero-day threats, this study investigates the effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score. Furthermore, Isolation Forest demonstrated a markedly superior computational footprint, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. These findings underscore Isolation Forest's robustness in high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT environments and highlight its practical viability for real-time anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Energy and control constraints are critical for accurate modeling of musculoskeletal motor control, providing evidence that these biological constraints are essential for realistic simulation of embodied control systems.

Abstract: The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of two variants of the XGBoost regression model, the full-capacity and lightweight (tiny) versions, for predicting the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Using the AirQualityUCI dataset collected over one year in an urban environment, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on widely accepted metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, we assessed resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. The full XGBoost model achieved superior predictive accuracy for both pollutants, while the tiny model, though slightly less precise, offered substantial computational benefits with significantly reduced inference time and model storage requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying simplified models in resource-constrained environments without compromising predictive quality. This makes the tiny XGBoost model suitable for real-time air-quality monitoring in IoT and embedded applications.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 6 out of 12 domains from The Well benchmark, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. Demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems.

Conclusion: Large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes yields transferable representations of dynamics, marking progress toward unified foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present PDE-FM, a modular foundation model for physics-informed machine learning that unifies spatial, spectral, and temporal reasoning across heterogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) systems. PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes. These results suggest that large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes can yield transferable representations of dynamics, marking a step toward unified, foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Transformers (EqT) introduce closed-loop prediction via iterative refinement of latent representations before token commitment, addressing open-loop bottlenecks in autoregressive transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive transformers operate in open loop where hidden states are computed once without revision, causing error propagation and failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning.

Method: Augment standard transformer layers with Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space, enforcing bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence without external supervision.

Result: +3.28% average improvement on binary parity task, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance; benefit scales with task difficulty.

Conclusion: Closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward more capable language models, unifying deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training.

Abstract: Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.

TL;DR: GM-VAE framework with EM-inspired training and spectral interpretability metric extracts physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to extract compact, physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data with complex nonlinear structures inherent in physical systems.

Method: Gaussian Mixture VAE with EM-inspired training using block-coordinate descent strategy (alternating expectation and maximization steps), plus novel spectral interpretability metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness.

Result: Demonstrated on surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images; yields smooth physically consistent manifolds and accurate regime clustering.

Conclusion: GM-VAE offers robust data-driven tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems through physically interpretable representations.

Abstract: Extracting compact, physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data is a persistent challenge due to the complex, nonlinear structures inherent in physical systems. We propose a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GM-VAE) framework designed to address this by integrating an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-inspired training scheme with a novel spectral interpretability metric. Unlike conventional VAEs that jointly optimize reconstruction and clustering (often leading to training instability), our method utilizes a block-coordinate descent strategy, alternating between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes. To objectively evaluate the learned representations, we introduce a quantitative metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which measures the coherence of physical quantities across the latent manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on datasets of increasing complexity: surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images. The results show that our GM-VAE yields smooth, physically consistent manifolds and accurate regime clustering, offering a robust data-driven tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems.

*Regan Willis,Jason Bakos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Late fusion gives highest accuracy but slowest inference, early fusion gives fastest inference but lower accuracy - tradeoff between accuracy and latency in multimodal fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal ML models need to balance accuracy and latency requirements when fusing multiple data streams, as fusion strategy affects both performance metrics.

Method: Hybrid BERT+vision network framework with MobileNetV2 and ViT, testing three fusion strategies (late, intermediate, early) on CMU MOSI dataset, benchmarking latency on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX.

Result: Late fusion yields highest accuracy, early fusion offers lowest inference latency, demonstrating clear tradeoff between accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: Earlier data fusion in model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy, requiring careful strategy selection based on application requirements.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models often combine multiple input streams of data to more accurately capture the information that informs their decisions. In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency. We describe the three proposed model architectures and discuss the accuracy and latency tradeoffs, concluding that data fusion earlier in the model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy.

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient federated edge learning framework that jointly optimizes model pruning and client selection to improve generalization and resource utilization under energy and delay constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated edge learning suffers from limited heterogeneous local datasets and resource constraints that degrade model generalization and resource utilization, compromising learning performance.

Method: Proposes a parameter-efficient FEEL framework combining model pruning and client selection, with information-theoretic generalization analysis embedded into convergence analysis. Formulates a generalization-aware optimization problem solved via alternating optimization algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior learning performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses FEEL challenges by jointly optimizing pruning, client selection, and resource allocation, demonstrating improved generalization and efficiency in resource-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.

TL;DR: Proposes a task-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions in multi-modal foundation models using generative reconstruction and consensus-based aggregation to restore cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal foundation models that align images, text, and other modalities are vulnerable to adversarial illusions - imperceptible perturbations that disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks.

Method: Uses generative models (e.g., VAEs) to reconstruct inputs from attacker's perturbed inputs, combined with generative sampling strategy and consensus-based aggregation over generated samples to enhance defense.

Result: Substantially reduces illusion attack success rates to near-zero, improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) in unperturbed settings and 11% (32 to 43) in perturbed settings on state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders.

Conclusion: Provides an effective and model-agnostic defense mechanism against adversarial illusions in multi-modal foundation models, maintaining natural alignment through generative reconstruction and consensus aggregation.

Abstract: Multi-modal foundation models align images, text, and other modalities in a shared embedding space but remain vulnerable to adversarial illusions (Zhang et al., 2025), where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. To counteract the effects of adversarial illusions, we propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs the input from the attacker's perturbed input through generative models, e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to maintain natural alignment. To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders show that our approach substantially reduces the illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) and 11% (32 to 43) in unperturbed and perturbed input settings respectively, providing an effective and model-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions.

TL;DR: Electron density maps outperform atom-based representations in low-data protein-ligand binding prediction and quantum property modeling, offering better data efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atom-based representations for 3D molecular property prediction may miss subtle physical information. Electron density maps from experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM offer continuous, physically grounded alternatives that could capture richer structural and electronic information.

Method: Compared three voxel-based input types for 3D CNNs: atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude. Tested on two molecular tasks: protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). Used voxel-based CNNs as electron density is inherently volumetric and voxel grids provide natural representation for both experimental and computed densities.

Result: On PDBbind: All representations performed similarly with full data, but density-based inputs outperformed atom types in low-data regimes. Shape-based baseline performed comparably, suggesting spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9: Density-based inputs outperformed atom-based ones at scale, even when labels came from DFT but input densities from lower-level XTB method, reflecting rich structural and electronic information in density.

Conclusion: Electron density-derived inputs offer task- and regime-dependent advantages: improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling. They provide physically grounded representations that capture richer structural and electronic information than atom-based approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning models for 3D molecular property prediction typically rely on atom-based representations, which may overlook subtle physical information. Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.

*Hamid Shamszare,Avishek Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-modal ML framework combining facial video and GSR data predicts early user trust in AI recommendations for ADHD mHealth, achieving high accuracy with multimodal stacking ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting human trust in AI systems is crucial for safe integration in healthcare, especially in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

Method: Multi-modal ML framework combining image (facial video processed with OpenCV and transformer model) and GSR data (decomposed into tonic/phasic components). Two temporal windows: Early (6-3s before decision) and Proximal (3-0s before decision). Used unimodal models and multimodal stacking ensemble for trust prediction.

Result: Multimodal stacking achieved accuracy 0.83, F1 0.88, ROC-AUC 0.87 in Early Window; accuracy 0.75, F1 0.82, ROC-AUC 0.66 in Proximal Window. Combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: Bio signals serve as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust responses to maintain calibrated trust in mental health applications.

Abstract: Predicting human trust in AI systems is crucial for safe integration of AI-based decision support tools, especially in healthcare. This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

Motivation: Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics is complex and underexplored. The paper aims to analyze the impact of backdoor data on learning processes, focusing on differences between target class and clean classes.

Method: Leverages Information Bottleneck principle connected with clustering of internal representations to analyze mutual information signatures that evolve across training phases. Proposes a novel dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies attack integration at the model level.

Result: Finds that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information signatures that differ based on attack mechanism. Uncovers surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly than many visually imperceptible attacks.

Conclusion: The analysis provides new insights into backdoor attack dynamics and proposes a novel metric for evaluating attack stealthiness at the model level, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

Abstract: Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics remains a complex and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

TL;DR: ProPS integrates LLMs into RL's policy optimization loop, using both numerical rewards and semantic language inputs to achieve more sample-efficient learning across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL relies only on scalar rewards, missing rich semantic knowledge available in real-world tasks. Humans learn by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense, suggesting RL could benefit from similar integration.

Method: ProPS places a large language model at the center of the policy optimization loop, directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. The LLM performs numerical optimization in-context, incorporating semantic signals like goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints.

Result: ProPS outperforms seven baseline RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, TRPO, etc.) on 8 out of 15 Gymnasium tasks spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments. It shows substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge.

Conclusion: Unifying semantics and numerics enables more transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned reinforcement learning. LLMs can effectively perform numerical optimization in-context when combined with semantic signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally relies on scalar reward signals, limiting its ability to leverage the rich semantic knowledge often available in real-world tasks. In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO). It outperforms all baselines on eight out of fifteen tasks and demonstrates substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of unifying semantics and numerics for transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods focus on explaining model behavior but lack a baseline from the data itself to assess whether models truly reflect what the data says.

Method: Uses Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework to quantify feature separation between outcome groups in binary classification, creating data-derived feature rankings that are compared against model-based explanations.

Result: Provides an interpretable, model-agnostic method to assess model-data alignment by establishing a data-derived baseline for comparison.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to evaluate whether machine learning models say what the data says, moving beyond traditional model explanation to assess alignment with underlying data structure.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework to evaluate whether machine learning models align with the structure of the data they learn from; that is, whether \textit{the model says what the data says}. Unlike existing interpretability methods that focus exclusively on explaining model behavior, our approach establishes a baseline derived directly from the data itself. Drawing inspiration from Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework, we quantify how strongly each feature separates the two outcome groups in a binary classification task, moving beyond traditional descriptive statistics to estimate each feature's effect on the outcome. By comparing these data-derived feature rankings against model-based explanations, we provide practitioners with an interpretable and model-agnostic method to assess model--data alignment.

TL;DR: A heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework for automated feature transformation that addresses dynamic feature expansion and agent cooperation issues through shared critics and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature transformation remains crucial for structured data where deep models struggle with complex feature interactions. Existing automated approaches rely on inefficient heuristics or exhaustive searches, while RL-based methods face challenges with dynamic feature expansion and insufficient agent cooperation.

Method: Proposes a heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework with three agents grouped into two types for selecting features and operations. Uses shared critic mechanism for agent communication, multi-head attention-based feature agents to handle dynamic feature expansion, and state encoding for learning stability.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability in feature transformation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of previous RL-based feature transformation methods by enabling cooperative agent communication and handling dynamic feature spaces, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies.

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances downstream task performance by generating informative features through mathematical feature crossing. Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model.

TL;DR: Human defections in AI agent pricing ecosystems can destabilize algorithmic collusion and drive prices toward competitive levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human participation affects algorithmic collusion in mixed human-AI ecosystems, particularly in repeated pricing games where AI agents use equilibrium strategies while humans defect to no-regret strategies.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a stylized model of repeated pricing games where AI agents play equilibrium strategies and humans defect to no-regret strategies, examining how defections affect price sustainability.

Result: Even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices; multiple defections push prices closer to competitive levels. The nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents.

Conclusion: Algorithmic collusion is fragile in mixed human-AI ecosystems when humans defect, but persists under certain conditions with defection-aware AI agents, characterizing when collusion breaks down versus endures.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in ecosystems where they repeatedly interact not only with each other but also with humans. In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive BCIs based on C-VEPs need robust decoding methods to handle temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals, which traditional approaches struggle with.

Method: Proposed deep learning architectures including CNNs for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction/classification and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, compared against CCA baselines. Used Earth Mover's Distance and constrained EMD for distance-based decoding, with temporal data augmentation via small shifts.

Conclusion: Data-driven deep architectures, particularly multi-class Siamese networks, demonstrate strong potential for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems, offering superior robustness to EEG variability.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.

### [242] [ABLE: Using Adversarial Pairs to Construct Local Models for Explaining Model Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21952)
*Krishna Khadka,Sunny Shree,Pujan Budhathoki,Yu Lei,Raghu Kacker,D. Richard Kuhn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABLE (Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation) is a novel local explanation method that uses adversarial attacks to generate boundary-bracketing pairs, then trains linear models on these pairs for more stable and faithful explanations of black-box ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local explanation methods like LIME suffer from instability and poor local fidelity when explaining black-box machine learning models, which is problematic for critical applications requiring transparency.

Method: ABLE generates neighborhood points near test instances using bounded Gaussian noise, then applies two-step adversarial attacks to create adversarial pairs (A and A') that bracket the local decision boundary. Linear models are trained on these pairs to approximate the boundary.

Result: Experiments on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures show that ABLE achieves higher stability and fidelity than state-of-the-art explanation methods.

Conclusion: ABLE provides a more robust and faithful approach to local model explanations by leveraging adversarial attacks to better capture decision boundaries, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art.

*Hongyu Yang,Chunxi Wen,Jiyin Zhang,Nanfei Shen,Shijiao Zhang,Xiyan Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores CTR prediction using Taobao data, comparing traditional models (LR, Light-GBM) with deep learning approaches (MLPs, Transformer) that incorporate behavioral sequences, achieving significant AUC improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTR prediction is critical for advertising systems, but traditional supervised models have limited ability to capture complex user behavior patterns and temporal dynamics that drive clicks.

Method: Used large-scale Taobao dataset with static features and behavioral sequences. Compared logistic regression and Light-GBM with deep learning approaches including MLPs and a Transformer-based architecture with self-attention to model temporal dependencies in user interaction sequences.

Result: Transformer model improved AUC by 2.81% over logistic regression baseline, with largest gains for users with diverse or changing interests. MLPs also showed significant improvements over traditional models.

Conclusion: Deep learning models with behavioral sequence modeling outperform traditional CTR prediction methods. The approach has broader applications beyond e-commerce, including public health information targeting, and provides a roadmap for advancing CTR prediction systems.

Abstract: Click-through rates prediction is critical in modern advertising systems, where ranking relevance and user engagement directly impact platform efficiency and business value. In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance. Our research provides a roadmap for advancing click-through rate predictions and extending their value beyond e-commerce.

Conclusion: The study advances AI-assisted RFIC design automation and provides practical tools for designers, showing that ML surrogate models with transfer learning and evolutionary optimization can effectively solve inverse design problems for RF transformers.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic framework for securing agentic AI systems in enterprises, viewing safety/security as emergent properties from interactions, with novel risk taxonomy and AI-driven red teaming approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional safety and security approaches for individual models don't address emergent risks in agentic AI systems where multiple components interact dynamically. Need for unified framework that handles novel agentic-specific risks beyond conventional concerns.

Method: Develops operational agentic risk taxonomy unifying traditional and novel risks (tool misuse, cascading actions, control amplification). Creates dynamic safety/security framework using auxiliary AI models/agents with human oversight for contextual risk management. Implements sandboxed AI-driven red teaming for risk discovery.

Result: Framework demonstrated effective through case study of NVIDIA's AI-Q Research Assistant, discovering novel agentic risks that were contextually mitigated. Released dataset of 10,000+ realistic attack/defense execution traces to advance agentic safety research.

Conclusion: Safety and security in agentic AI systems require dynamic, contextual approaches that address emergent risks from component interactions. The proposed framework successfully identifies and mitigates novel agentic risks, advancing enterprise deployment security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic and actionable framework for securing agentic AI systems in enterprise deployment. We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning hypergraphs efficiently is important for applications like evolutionary tree reconstruction, where distance measurements degrade with increased distance, requiring bounded distance queries.

Method: Developed first provably optimal online algorithm for orderly hypertrees using shortest-path queries, transformable to optimal offline algorithm. Also analyzed bounded distance query model for general hypertrees.

Result: Achieved optimal query complexity for orderly hypertrees (subquadratic), positioned them within Fagin hierarchy, and established asymptotically tight complexity bounds for general hypertrees with bounded distance queries.

Conclusion: Orderly hypertrees represent the broadest learnable class in Fagin hierarchy with subquadratic complexity, and bounded distance queries enable efficient learning of general hypertrees with tight complexity bounds.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning hypergraphs with shortest-path queries (SP-queries), and present the first provably optimal online algorithm for a broad and natural class of hypertrees that we call orderly hypertrees. Our online algorithm can be transformed into a provably optimal offline algorithm. Orderly hypertrees can be positioned within the Fagin hierarchy of acyclic hypergraph (well-studied in database theory), and strictly encompass the broadest class in this hierarchy that is learnable with subquadratic SP-query complexity.
  Recognizing that in some contexts, such as evolutionary tree reconstruction, distance measurements can degrade with increased distance, we also consider a learning model that uses bounded distance queries. In this model, we demonstrate asymptotically tight complexity bounds for learning general hypertrees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) traditionally requires infinitesimal perturbations for gradient estimation, limiting practical applications. The paper aims to free EP from this constraint by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment.

Method: Model network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points. Prove gradient of Helmholtz free energy difference equals difference in expected local energy derivatives. Derive generalized EP algorithm based on path integral of loss-energy covariances.

Result: Validates Contrastive Hebbian Learning as exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging without infinitesimal approximations or convexity requirements. Enables learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

Conclusion: Establishes finite-nudge foundation for EP, liberating it from infinitesimal perturbation constraints and enabling more practical applications with stronger error signals while maintaining theoretical exactness.

Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based drowsiness detection suffers from inter-subject variability and domain shift problems, requiring cumbersome calibration and limiting generalization to unseen subjects.

Method: Proposes a driver drowsiness detection framework using online test-time adaptation (TTA) that updates batch normalization parameters while preserving pretrained statistics, incorporates a memory bank to manage streaming EEG segments based on reliability scores, and uses prototype learning for robustness against distribution shifts.

Result: Achieves average F1-score of 81.73% on sustained-attention driving dataset, outperforming all baselines with 11.73% improvement over best TTA baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios by effectively addressing domain shift through online test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Drowsy driving is a growing cause of traffic accidents, prompting recent exploration of electroencephalography (EEG)-based drowsiness detection systems. However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\%, an improvement of 11.73\% over the best TTA baseline. This demonstrates that our proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite regulatory progress, fossil fuels remain a major component of energy supply, causing significant air pollution and public health impacts. Current approaches lack advanced demand-side methods to reduce health impacts, creating a need for health-informed energy management systems.

Method: Three-component AI pipeline: 1) Fuel mix predictor estimates generation source contributions, 2) Air quality converter models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, 3) Health impact assessor translates pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Applied across multiple US regions with health-driven optimization framework.

Result: The health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors for public health impacts compared to fuel mix-driven baselines. Case study on EV charging schedules demonstrates public health gains and provides actionable guidance for health-informed energy management.

Conclusion: AI models can be explicitly designed to enable health-informed energy management, advancing public health and societal well-being. The approach offers practical guidance for demand-side management and demonstrates the potential of domain-specific AI for environmental health applications.

Abstract: The electric power sector is a leading source of air pollutant emissions, impacting the public health of nearly every community. Although regulatory measures have reduced air pollutants, fossil fuels remain a significant component of the energy supply, highlighting the need for more advanced demand-side approaches to reduce the public health impacts. To enable health-informed demand-side management, we introduce HealthPredictor, a domain-specific AI model that provides an end-to-end pipeline linking electricity use to public health outcomes. The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management. Overall, this work shows how AI models can be explicitly designed to enable health-informed energy management for advancing public health and broader societal well-being.

*Yiran Zhang,Weihang Xu,Mo Zhou,Maryam Fazel,Simon Shaolei Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of gradient descent for over-parameterized score matching on single Gaussian data, showing convergence depends on noise scale and initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of score matching in diffusion models, theoretical understanding of optimization behavior in over-parameterized regimes is limited, especially for Gaussian distributions.

Method: Analyze gradient descent dynamics for training over-parameterized student models on single Gaussian data using population score matching objective. Study multiple regimes: high-noise, low-noise, and different initialization strategies (exponentially small vs random Gaussian).

Result: 1) Global convergence proven for large noise scale. 2) Low-noise regime has stationary point, making global convergence hard. 3) With exponentially small initialization, all parameters converge to ground truth. 4) Without such initialization, parameters may not converge. 5) With random Gaussian initialization far from ground truth, only one parameter converges while others diverge, yet loss converges to zero with 1/τ rate, with nearly matching lower bound.

Conclusion: First work establishing global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under score matching framework. Shows optimization dynamics depend critically on noise scale and initialization, providing theoretical foundation for understanding score matching training.

Abstract: Score matching has become a central training objective in modern generative modeling, particularly in diffusion models, where it is used to learn high-dimensional data distributions through the estimation of score functions. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/τ$ rate, where $τ$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime. This is the first work to establish global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EV charging demand forecasting methods, especially graph neural networks, are limited to pairwise station relationships and fail to capture complex group-wise dynamics in urban charging networks, which is essential for stable grid operation and EV market participation.

Method: HyperCast uses hypergraphs to model higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies, integrating multi-view hypergraphs (static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities) with multi-timescale inputs. It employs hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and cross-attention mechanisms to fuse information from different views and timescales.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling collective charging behaviors.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling higher-order group-wise dynamics through hypergraphs enables more accurate EV charging demand forecasting, addressing limitations of existing pairwise relationship models and improving grid stability and market participation.

Abstract: Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.

TL;DR: ARES is an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal graph edge streams that combines GNNs for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees for anomaly scoring, validated on cyber-attack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for risk mitigation but challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and real-time requirements. Traditional methods struggle with these dynamic streaming scenarios.

Method: ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture spike and burst anomalous behaviors by embedding node/edge properties in latent space, with Half-Space Trees (HST) for efficient anomaly scoring. It also includes a supervised thresholding mechanism using statistical dispersion of scores with minimal labeled data.

Result: ARES was extensively evaluated on real-world cyber-attack scenarios, showing competitive performance against existing methods while maintaining efficient space and time complexity.

Conclusion: ARES provides an effective unsupervised framework for real-time edge anomaly detection in temporal graphs, addressing challenges of concept drift and scalability while demonstrating practical utility in cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios involving streaming information can be represented as temporal graphs, where data flows through dynamic changes in edges over time. Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains. We validate ARES through extensive evaluations across several real-world cyber-attack scenarios, comparing its performance against existing methods while analyzing its space and time complexity.

TL;DR: FedWMSAM addresses two failure modes in federated learning when combining momentum and SAM: local-global curvature misalignment and momentum-echo oscillation, using momentum-guided global perturbation and adaptive momentum-SAM coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated learning, models need to converge quickly under tight communication budgets while generalizing across non-IID client distributions. Simply combining momentum (for acceleration) and SAM (for flat solutions) fails in non-IID FL due to two structural issues: local-global curvature misalignment and momentum-echo oscillation.

Method: FedWMSAM addresses both failure modes: (1) constructs momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with global descent geometry, enabling single-backprop SAM approximation; (2) couples momentum and SAM via cosine-similarity adaptive rule, creating early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule.

Result: The paper provides a non-IID convergence bound that explicitly models perturbation-induced variance and its dependence on system parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of FedWMSAM, demonstrating superiority in addressing FL optimization challenges.

Conclusion: FedWMSAM successfully resolves the twin challenges of fast convergence and good generalization in non-IID federated learning by addressing the identified failure modes of momentum-SAM combination, offering both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), models must \emph{converge quickly} under tight communication budgets while \emph{generalizing} across non-IID client distributions. These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $σ_ρ^2=σ^2+(Lρ)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

*Jiayu Liu,Chong Liu,Trevor Rhone,Yinan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework improves aerospace fuselage assembly by using quantum algorithms for more efficient shape adjustment with fewer samples compared to classical Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart manufacturing needs better sample efficiency in aerospace fuselage assembly. Classical Monte Carlo methods require many samples for accurate estimation, while quantum algorithms can achieve similar accuracy with significantly fewer samples from distributions.

Method: Proposes Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework using quantum oracle based on FEA/surrogate models to estimate environment response with fewer queries. Uses Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function to strategically select inputs that maximize objective function.

Result: QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods using the same number of simulation queries. Experimental case study with force-controlled actuators shows improved gap reduction between fuselage sections.

Conclusion: Quantum Bayesian Optimization provides a promising approach for precise shape control in aerospace assembly with superior sample efficiency, enabling more accurate dimensional gap reduction with fewer manufacturing system queries.

Abstract: Recent efforts in smart manufacturing have enhanced aerospace fuselage assembly processes, particularly by innovating shape adjustment techniques to minimize dimensional gaps between assembled sections. Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation.

*Daniel Agyei Asante,Md Mokarram Chowdhury,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-rank compression of LLMs generally preserves or improves privacy and adversarial robustness but degrades ethical reasoning and fairness, with model scale and fine-tuning playing important roles in trustworthiness outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While low-rank factorization effectively compresses LLMs for resource-constrained deployment, its impact on trustworthiness aspects (privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, ethical alignment) remains poorly understood and requires comprehensive investigation.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs of different sizes compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, assessing trustworthiness across four dimensions: privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. Includes investigation of model scale and fine-tuning effects, plus gradient-based attribution analysis to identify layers contributing to adversarial robustness.

Result: (1) Low-rank compression preserves/improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection in conversations; (2) Adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced even under deep compression; (3) Ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) Fairness declines under compression. Model scale and fine-tuning significantly affect trustworthiness outcomes.

Conclusion: Low-rank compression has complex, dimension-specific effects on LLM trustworthiness, requiring careful consideration when deploying compressed models. The study provides guidance for trustworthy compression strategies and identifies key layers contributing to adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances across domains, yet their massive size hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness.

*Jonathan Ethier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural network predicts both mean and link-specific variance for path loss, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates that improve RF planning and model diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path loss models assume constant prediction variance, which doesn't capture the varying uncertainty across different wireless links. There's a need for models that can provide link-specific uncertainty estimates to improve RF planning, interference analysis, and model self-diagnostics.

Method: Proposes a neural network that jointly predicts mean and link-specific variance by minimizing Gaussian negative log-likelihood. Compares three architectures: shared-parameter, partially shared, and independent-parameter. Evaluates using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets.

Result: Shared-parameter architecture performs best with RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1% coverage for 95% prediction intervals, and mean interval width of 29.6 dB. The uncertainty estimates enable link-specific coverage margins and improve RF planning and interference analyses.

Conclusion: Heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation in path loss modeling provides valuable link-specific uncertainty information that supports better RF planning, improves interference analysis, and offers effective self-diagnostics for identifying model weaknesses.

Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.

*Bowen Wang,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DDAM-TOGD, a tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm for dynamic associative memory in multi-agent systems with time-varying data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend classical associative memory to distributed, multi-agent settings with time-varying data streams, addressing the need for selective information sharing among agents based on interest matrices.

Method: DDAM-TOGD algorithm: tree-based distributed online gradient descent where each agent maintains local associative memory, updates via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees, with combinatorial tree design to optimize communication delays.

Result: Proves sublinear static regret in stationary environments and path-length dependent dynamic regret in non-stationary environments. Numerical experiments show superior accuracy and robustness compared to consensus-based distributed optimization baselines.

Conclusion: DDAM-TOGD provides an effective framework for distributed dynamic associative memory with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits in dynamic, distributed environments.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.

*Quan Zhou,Shie Mannor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for selecting a small representative action subset from extremely large action spaces in RL environments, enabling efficient learning without exhaustive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct learning over entire large action spaces is intractable in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems. There's a need to identify fixed subsets that contain near-optimal actions for every environment in a family.

Method: Extends prior meta-bandit results to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Uses an existing algorithm that works under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model to accommodate environmental heterogeneity.

Result: Proves the algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. Provides theoretical guarantees for computationally and sample-efficient solutions in large-scale combinatorial decision-making.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient learning in large action spaces by selecting representative subsets, with theoretical guarantees extending from meta-bandits to MDPs under relaxed environmental models.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.

*Saad Masrur,Ismail Guvenc,David Lopez Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARL-DDQN framework for dynamic sleep mode optimization in mmWave networks achieves superior energy efficiency while maintaining QoS through distributed multi-agent learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sleep mode optimization approaches in mmWave networks rely on aggregated static traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework using Double Deep Q-Network (MARL-DDQN) for adaptive sleep mode optimization in 3D urban environments with time-varying community-based UE mobility. Integrates realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming for accurate EE quantification.

Result: MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies (All On, IT-QoS-LB, MARL-DDPG, MARL-PPO), achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The MARL-DDQN framework enables scalable, distributed decision-making for sleep mode optimization in mmWave networks, effectively balancing energy efficiency with QoS requirements while adapting to dynamic traffic conditions.

Abstract: Dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks is essential for maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. However, existing optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches rely on aggregated, static base station (BS) traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary traffic dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), referred to as MARL-DDQN, for adaptive SMO in a 3D urban environment with a time-varying and community-based user equipment (UE) mobility model. Unlike conventional single-agent RL, MARL-DDQN enables scalable, distributed decision-making with minimal signaling overhead. A realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming are integrated to accurately quantify EE, while QoS is defined in terms of throughput. The method adapts SMO policies to maximize EE while mitigating inter-cell interference and ensuring throughput fairness. Simulations show that MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies, including All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO, achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios.

*Zhou Biyan,Arindam Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes continuous learning approaches using Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Banditron and AGREL) adapted for Deep Spiking Neural Networks to address non-stationarity in implantable brain-machine interfaces, achieving stable performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As the number of recorded neurons in implantable BMIs increases exponentially, integrating neural decoders in implants becomes crucial for data compression in wireless systems. However, system non-stationarity makes decoder performance unreliable, requiring continuous learning approaches that avoid frequent retraining while ensuring user safety and comfort.

Method: The authors propose continuous learning approaches using Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Banditron and AGREL) adapted for Deep Spiking Neural Networks. These RL algorithms were chosen because they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively address non-stationary problems, and fit the energy constraints of implantable devices. Both open-loop and closed-loop experiments were conducted to assess effectiveness.

Result: Open-loop experiments showed stable accuracy over extended periods for both DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL. In closed-loop experiments with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to DSNN AGREL while achieving 98% reduction in memory access usage and 99% reduction in multiply-and-accumulate operations during training. Compared to previous continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron requires 98% less computation.

Conclusion: DSNN Banditron emerges as a prime candidate for future wireless iBMI systems due to its stable performance in non-stationary environments, comparable effectiveness to other RL approaches, and dramatically reduced computational requirements (98-99% reductions in memory access and MAC operations), making it suitable for resource-constrained implantable devices.

Abstract: The number of simultaneously recorded neurons follows an exponentially increasing trend in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). Integrating the neural decoder in the implant is an effective data compression method for future wireless iBMIs. However, the non-stationarity of the system makes the performance of the decoder unreliable. To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training. Compared to previous continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron requires 98% less computes making it a prime candidate for future wireless iBMI systems.

*Reza Mansouri,Dustin Kempton,Pete Riley,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFNO neural operator outperforms traditional HUX model for solar wind velocity prediction, enabling faster space weather forecasting with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar wind variations disrupt space systems, but traditional 3D MHD models are computationally expensive for investigating boundary condition uncertainty, limiting space weather forecasting capabilities.

Method: Developed a surrogate model using Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) for steady state solar wind modeling, comparing it against existing HUX numerical surrogate.

Result: SFNO achieves comparable or better performance than HUX across several metrics, though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness. SFNO enables efficient real-time forecasting and can improve with more data.

Conclusion: SFNO provides a flexible, trainable approach for solar wind modeling that outperforms traditional surrogates, highlighting the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than viewing its limitations as flaws.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Variations such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications, making accurate modeling essential for space weather forecasting. While 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are used to simulate and investigate these variations in the solar wind, they tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness in investigating the impacts of boundary condition uncertainty. In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO. As a flexible and trainable approach, SFNO enables efficient real-time forecasting and can improve with more data.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal%*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IVGAE is a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework for imputing missing data in heterogeneous tabular datasets using a bipartite graph representation and dual-decoder architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imputation methods struggle with capturing complex structural dependencies and effectively handling heterogeneous data (both numerical and categorical features) in real-world tabular datasets with missing values.

Method: IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships, uses graph representation learning to model structural dependencies, employs a dual-decoder architecture (one for feature reconstruction, one for missingness patterns), and introduces a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module for categorical variables.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 scores across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30% missing rates.

Conclusion: IVGAE provides an effective framework for robust imputation of incomplete heterogeneous data by leveraging graph representation learning and structural priors aware of missing mechanisms.

Abstract: Handling missing data remains a fundamental challenge in real-world tabular datasets, especially when data are heterogeneous with both numerical and categorical features. Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex structural dependencies and handle heterogeneous data effectively. We present \textbf{IVGAE}, a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework for robust imputation of incomplete heterogeneous data. IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships and applies graph representation learning to model structural dependencies. A key innovation is its \textit{dual-decoder architecture}, where one decoder reconstructs feature embeddings and the other models missingness patterns, providing structural priors aware of missing mechanisms. To better encode categorical variables, we introduce a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module that avoids high-dimensional one-hot encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show that IVGAE achieves consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30\% missing rates.

### [264] [A Variational Manifold Embedding Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22128)
*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variational framework for dimensionality reduction that generalizes PCA to nonlinear embeddings while maintaining interpretability through PDEs and symmetry properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods have limitations: PCA variants are linear and inflexible for nonlinear manifolds, autoencoders lack interpretability, and graph-based methods can distort manifold geometry.

Method: Proposes a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction as an optimal manifold embedding problem, allowing nonlinear embeddings while maintaining interpretability through partial differential equations and symmetry analysis.

Result: The framework produces flexible nonlinear embeddings, satisfies interpretable PDEs, reflects symmetries of the embedding objective, and can be analytically characterized in some cases. PCA is recovered as a special case.

Conclusion: The variational framework addresses key limitations of existing methods by providing flexible nonlinear dimensionality reduction with mathematical interpretability, generalizing PCA while overcoming its linearity constraints.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction algorithms like principal component analysis (PCA) are workhorses of machine learning and neuroscience, but each has well-known limitations. Variants of PCA are simple and interpretable, but not flexible enough to capture nonlinear data manifold structure. More flexible approaches have other problems: autoencoders are generally difficult to interpret, and graph-embedding-based methods can produce pathological distortions in manifold geometry. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction algorithms as solutions to an optimal manifold embedding problem. By construction, this framework permits nonlinear embeddings, allowing its solutions to be more flexible than PCA. Moreover, the variational nature of the framework has useful consequences for interpretability: each solution satisfies a set of partial differential equations, and can be shown to reflect symmetries of the embedding objective. We discuss these features in detail and show that solutions can be analytically characterized in some cases. Interestingly, one special case exactly recovers PCA.

TL;DR: BELA benchmark evaluates agents' ability to learn and adapt through experience in ambiguous, shifting real-world environments like product recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluations focus on unambiguous tasks and don't measure agents' ability to adaptively learn through accumulated experiences in dynamic environments.

Method: Created BELA benchmark combining: (1) real Amazon products, (2) diverse user personas with latent preferences, (3) LLM-powered user simulator for interactive dialogues.

Result: Current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, highlighting their poor in-context experiential learning capabilities.

Conclusion: There's a critical need for agentic systems with stronger in-context learning abilities to handle real-world ambiguity and shifting environments.

Abstract: To reliably navigate ever-shifting real-world environments, agents must grapple with incomplete knowledge and adapt their behavior through experience. However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of model-form errors in dynamical systems and enable trustworthy digital twins with systematic uncertainty propagation from diagnosis to prediction.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) to estimate model-form errors as latent forces, then trains Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to learn probabilistic nonlinear mappings from states to errors, enabling prediction via Kalman filtering with pseudo-measurements.

Result: Demonstrated on four nonlinear examples (SDOF oscillator, multi-DOF system, Bouc-Wen hysteretic system, Silverbox dataset) showing predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic uncertainty propagation from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins in systems with misspecified physics.

Abstract: This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of small language models (SLMs) for agentic tasks (function/tool/API calling) with a focus on running agents on edge devices without reliance on cloud infrastructure. We evaluate SLMs using the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) framework and describe parameter-driven optimization strategies that include supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and hybrid methods. We report results for models including TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM across BFCL categories (simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection), both in live and non-live settings, and in multi-turn evaluations. We additionally detail a DPO training pipeline constructed from AgentBank data (e.g., ALFRED), including our conversion of SFT data to chosen-rejected pairs using TinyLlama responses as rejected outputs and manual validation.

UTS successfully predicts model-specific properties, reveals architecture-driven similarities, links topological structure to ranking effectiveness, and accurately predicts document retrievability.

Conclusion: A holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential for understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings. UTS provides an effective framework for characterizing embedding spaces and connecting their topological structure to practical performance.

Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.

*Peiyu Yu,Suraj Kothawade,Sirui Xie,Ying Nian Wu,Hongliang Fei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve text-to-image generation by learning instance-level sampling schedules instead of modifying model weights, using a Dirichlet policy with a James-Stein estimator for better gradient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most post-training methods focus on modifying model weights (fine-tuning or distillation), but this paper explores rescheduling the sampling timeline of frozen samplers as an alternative model-agnostic approach to unlock additional generative potential.

Method: Proposes learning instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) sampling schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. Introduces a novel reward baseline using a principled James-Stein estimator to ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning.

Result: Rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across Stable Diffusion and Flux models. A 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with learned schedules achieves quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell.

Conclusion: The scheduling framework serves as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that can unlock additional generative potential in pretrained samplers without modifying model weights.

Abstract: Most post-training methods for text-to-image samplers focus on model weights: either fine-tuning the backbone for alignment or distilling it for few-step efficiency. We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.

*Junsung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiCQL-ML is a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes reward and Q-functions in a bi-level framework without explicit policy learning, showing improved reward recovery and downstream policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline IRL needs to recover reward functions from fixed demonstration data without online interaction, but existing methods may suffer from over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions and require explicit policy learning.

Method: Bi-level framework alternating between: (1) learning conservative Q-function via CQL under current reward, and (2) updating reward parameters to maximize expert Q-values while suppressing over-generalization. Based on maximum likelihood estimation under soft value matching principle.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of convergence to reward where expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirical improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks for both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: BiCQL-ML provides an effective policy-free offline IRL approach with theoretical guarantees and empirical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function that explains expert behavior using only fixed demonstration data, without any additional online interaction. We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRE is a federated learning framework that enables heterogeneous model collaboration using entangled representations and random weights to improve privacy, reduce communication, and prevent overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL assumes homogeneous models, but real-world clients have heterogeneous data and resources. Model-heterogeneous FL is needed but faces challenges in privacy, communication overhead, and model performance.

Method: Clients aggregate local representations into entangled representations using normalized random weights, apply same weights to one-hot labels to create entangled-label encodings. These are uploaded to server to train global classifier. Random weights are resampled each round for diversity.

Result: FedRE achieves effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. Mitigates representation inversion attacks and reduces communication while preventing global classifier overconfidence.

Conclusion: FedRE provides a practical solution for model-heterogeneous FL with entangled representations that balances performance, privacy, and efficiency, addressing key challenges in real-world federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across clients without compromising privacy. While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. The codes are available at https://github.com/AIResearch-Group/FedRE.

*Henrijs Princis,Arindam Sharma,Cristina David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeCoder is a flexible framework that treats code generation as tree search with constraints, enabling systematic optimization of decoding strategies to improve LLM code correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate code that violates syntactic or semantic constraints when guided only by natural language prompts, requiring better methods to enforce correctness during decoding rather than relying on prompt engineering.

Method: TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search over candidate programs, treating both decoding strategies and constraint functions (style, syntax, execution) as first-class, optimizable components that can be systematically explored and tuned using standard optimization techniques.

Result: Experiments on MBPP (Python) and SQL-Spider benchmarks show TreeCoder consistently improves accuracy across open-source models like CodeLlama, Mistral, and DeepSeek, often outperforming their unconstrained baselines by considerable margins.

Conclusion: TreeCoder provides a general and flexible framework for exploring decoding strategies and constraints in LLM code generation, enabling systematic optimization that significantly improves code correctness across different models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generate code, yet their outputs often violate syntactic or semantic constraints when guided only through natural language prompts. We introduce TreeCoder, the most general and flexible framework to date for exploring decoding strategies, constraints, and hyperparameters in LLMs, and use it in code generation to enforce correctness and structure during decoding rather than relying on prompt engineering. TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search over candidate programs, where both decoding strategies and constraint functions - such as style, syntax, execution - are treated as first-class, optimisable components. This design enables systematic exploration and automatic tuning of decoding configurations using standard optimisation techniques. Experiments on the MBPP (Python) and SQL-Spider benchmarks show that TreeCoder consistently improves accuracy across open-source models such as CodeLlama, Mistral and DeepSeek, often outperforming their unconstrained baselines by considerable margins.

*Ofir Schlisselberg,Uri Sherman,Tomer Koren,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inexact OMD analysis reveals regularizer smoothness determines robustness to approximation errors, with sharp separation between negative entropy (requires exponential error precision) vs log-barrier/Tsallis regularizers (robust to polynomial errors).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OMD analyses assume error-free settings, but practical implementations often use approximate solutions to optimization subproblems. There's a gap in understanding how approximation errors affect performance guarantees in real-world applications.

Method: Systematic study of inexact OMD, analyzing relationship between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. Examines different regularizers (negative entropy, log-barrier, Tsallis) over simplex and its subsets under both adversarial and stochastic loss settings.

Result: Uniformly smooth regularizers have tight bounds on excess regret from errors. For barrier regularizers: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, while log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust with polynomial errors. Stochastic losses on simplex restore negative entropy's robustness, but not for all subsets.

Conclusion: Regularizer choice critically impacts OMD's robustness to approximation errors. Negative entropy is fragile to errors in adversarial settings, while log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers are more robust. Stochastic losses mitigate some issues but not universally across domains.

Abstract: Online mirror descent (OMD) is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that underlies many algorithms in optimization, machine learning and sequential decision-making. The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret.

### [275] [Online Dynamic Pricing of Complementary Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22291)
*Marco Mussi,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic pricing algorithm for complementary products using online learning with heteroscedastic Gaussian processes and integer programming to capture product demand interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most dynamic pricing algorithms optimize prices independently, ignoring demand interactions between related products, which prevents sellers from capturing full revenue potential through coordinated pricing strategies.

Method: Online learning algorithm that identifies complementary relationships via integer programming, then optimizes pricing using multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes to handle both positive and negative demand interactions.

Result: The solution improves revenue compared to comparable learning algorithms that ignore product interactions, as validated in simulated environments.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling complementary product relationships through data-driven dynamic pricing algorithms can significantly enhance revenue optimization beyond independent pricing approaches.

Abstract: Traditional pricing paradigms, once dominated by static models and rule-based heuristics, are increasingly being replaced by dynamic, data-driven approaches powered by machine learning algorithms. Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands. The algorithm utilizes transaction data to identify advantageous complementary relationships through an integer programming problem between different items, and then optimizes pricing strategies using data-driven and computationally efficient multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. We validate our solution in a simulated environment, and we demonstrate that our solution improves the revenue w.r.t. a comparable learning algorithm ignoring such interactions.

TL;DR: Neural ODEs and UDEs are used to create adaptive tumor growth models that outperform classical Gompertz/Bertalanffy equations by learning patient-specific dynamics from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical tumor growth models (Gompertz, Bertalanffy) are too rigid and fail to capture patient-specific variability, especially with limited clinical data. There's a need for more adaptive models that can personalize predictions for better treatment optimization.

Method: Replace rigid terms in classical Gompertz model with adaptive neural networks using Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs). Implement in Julia programming language. Perform forecasting under data constraints and symbolic recovery to transform learned dynamics into explicit mathematical expressions.

Result: Models demonstrate improved predictive accuracy compared to classical approaches. The symbolic recovery capability allows transformation of learned neural dynamics into interpretable mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: The SciML approach using Neural ODEs/UDEs has potential to significantly improve tumor growth forecasting accuracy, enabling more dynamic and effective personalized treatment strategies for better clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Forecasting tumor growth is critical for optimizing treatment. Classical growth models such as the Gompertz and Bertalanffy equations capture general tumor dynamics but may fail to adapt to patient-specific variability, particularly with limited data available. In this study, we leverage Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), to construct adaptive tumor growth models capable of learning from experimental data. Using the Gompertz model as a baseline, we replace rigid terms with adaptive neural networks to capture hidden dynamics through robust modeling in the Julia programming language. We use our models to perform forecasting under data constraints and symbolic recovery to transform the learned dynamics into explicit mathematical expressions. Our approach has the potential to improve predictive accuracy, guiding dynamic and effective treatment strategies for improved clinical outcomes.

*Dario Fenoglio,Mohan Li,Pietro Barbiero,Nicholas D. Lane,Marc Langheinrich,Martin Gjoreski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLUX is a novel clustering-based federated learning framework that addresses four common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time without requiring prior knowledge of shift types or cluster numbers, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL methods assume IID data across clients, but real-world scenarios often involve non-IID distribution shifts that significantly degrade global model performance, limiting FL's practical applicability.

Method: FLUX uses privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to handle distribution shifts. It doesn't require prior knowledge of shift types or cluster numbers, and supports test-time adaptation for unseen/unlabeled clients to use appropriate cluster-specific models.

Result: Extensive experiments across 4 standard benchmarks, 2 real-world datasets, and 10 SOTA baselines show FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving up to 23 percentage points average accuracy gain over best-performing baselines while maintaining FedAvg-level overhead.

Conclusion: FLUX effectively addresses non-IID distribution shifts in FL through unsupervised clustering without prior knowledge requirements, enabling robust performance and test-time adaptation while maintaining practical efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, when this assumption does not hold, the global model accuracy may drop significantly, limiting FL applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

*Wenbin Wu,Kejiang Qian,Alexis Lui,Christopher Jack,Yue Wu,Peter McBurney,Fengxiang He,Bryan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeXposure is the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in DeFi networks, with 43.7M entries across 4.3K protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3K tokens from 2020-2025, plus benchmarks for ML research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of large-scale datasets for studying inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, which is crucial for understanding financial dependencies, risk monitoring, and market dynamics in DeFi.

Method: Curated DeXposure dataset using DefiLlama metadata, defined value-linked credit exposure between protocols based on TVL changes, developed token-to-protocol model to infer credit exposure from token stock dynamics.

Result: Dataset reveals: (1) rapid network volume growth, (2) concentration to key protocols, (3) declining network density, (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors. Created three ML benchmarks: graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal GNNs for link prediction.

Conclusion: DeXposure dataset and code publicly released to support ML research and financial applications including risk monitoring, policy analysis, and DeFi market modeling, providing valuable benchmarks for graph analysis and temporal modeling.

Abstract: We curate the DeXposure dataset, the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, covering global markets of 43.7 million entries across 4.3 thousand protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3 thousand tokens, from 2020 to 2025. A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SingleQuant is a single-pass quantization framework that eliminates gradient noise and non-smoothness issues in LLM quantization by decoupling from quantization truncation, achieving 1400× speedup and improved task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM quantization methods suffer from convergence pathology due to incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation, which prolongs quantization time and degrades task performance. The Straight-Through Estimator on Stiefel manifolds introduces non-smoothness and gradient noise that obstruct optimization convergence.

Method: SingleQuant decouples from quantization truncation to eliminate non-smoothness and gradient noise. It constructs two rotation transformations: Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) for smoothing outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) for reshaping distributions through geometric mapping. Both use strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles.

Result: SingleQuant demonstrates superiority over baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. It achieves 1,400× quantization speedup for LLaMA-2-13B while increasing average task performance by +0.57% compared to the best baseline. The method enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance with less quantization time.

Conclusion: SingleQuant provides an efficient single-pass quantization framework that overcomes convergence pathology in LLM quantization by eliminating gradient noise and non-smoothness factors, enabling high-fidelity quantized LLMs with significantly reduced quantization time and improved task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) quantization facilitates deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings, but existing methods that combine incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation lead to serious convergence pathology. This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization. For example, when quantizing LLaMA-2-13B, SingleQuant achieves 1,400$\times$ quantization speedup and increases +0.57\% average task performance compared to the selected best baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML-based power flow calculations offer computational advantages but often lack full physical consistency, struggling to maintain AC power flow equalities and operational constraints.

Method: PI-TTT performs few gradient-based updates at inference time to refine surrogate outputs, enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints through self-supervised learning without labeled data.

Result: Reduces power flow residuals and constraint violations by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely ML models on IEEE 14-, 118-, 300-bus systems and PEGASE 1354-bus network while preserving computational advantage.

Conclusion: PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

*Denis Huseljic,Marek Herde,Lukas Rauch,Paul Hahn,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE is an ensemble active learning method that combines multiple AL strategies without prior knowledge of which will perform best, using progressive filtering and coverage-based selection to outperform individual strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different AL strategies capture different notions of data value (uncertainty, representativeness, etc.), and their effectiveness varies across datasets, models, and AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance since no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process.

Method: REFINE operates in two stages per AL cycle: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool using an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates that capture different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for.

Result: Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Progressive filtering also serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool.

Conclusion: REFINE provides an effective ensemble approach to active learning that adaptively combines multiple strategies, with the additional benefit that its progressive filtering can enhance any individual AL strategy. The ensemble framework can be easily extended with new state-of-the-art AL strategies.

Abstract: Existing active learning (AL) strategies capture fundamentally different notions of data value, e.g., uncertainty or representativeness. Consequently, the effectiveness of strategies can vary substantially across datasets, models, and even AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance, as no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process. We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case. Finally, the ensemble of REFINE can be easily extended with upcoming state-of-the-art AL strategies.

Abstract: On-device machine learning (ML) has become a fundamental component of emerging mobile applications. Adaptive model deployment delivers efficient inference for heterogeneous device capabilities and performance requirements through customizing neural architectures. SuperNet-based approaches offer a promising solution by generating a large number of model variants from a pre-trained ML model. However, applying SuperNet in existing frameworks suffers from tedious model-aware development and time-consuming hardware-aware profiling, which limits their practical adoption.
  We present AutoTailor, the first framework to enable automated, end-to-end SuperNet-based adaptive model deployment for edge devices. Unlike manual SuperNet construction, AutoTailor employs a computation graph-guided compilation approach to automatically transform user-provided ML models into SuperNets. To support efficient specialization, AutoTailor incorporates learning-free latency and accuracy predictors, enabling low-cost yet accurate performance prediction. Our extended evaluations demonstrate that AutoTailor reduces the lines of code for SuperNet construction by 11--27$\times$, decreases hardware-aware profiling costs by at least 11$\times$, and achieves up to 15.60\% absolute accuracy improvement and 60.03\% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches across diverse models and devices.

They leverage long-range dependencies and complex patterns in temporal signals, allowing them to achieve performance superior to traditional RNN and CNN models. However, they require high computational intensity and memory demands. In this work, we present Efficient-Husformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture developed with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for multi-class stress detection across two multimodal physiological datasets (WESAD and CogLoad). The main contributions of this work are: (1) the design of a structured search space, targeting effective hyperparameter optimization; (2) a comprehensive ablation study evaluating the impact of architectural decisions; (3) consistent performance improvements over the original Husformer, with the best configuration achieving an accuracy of 88.41 and 92.61 (improvements of 13.83% and 6.98%) on WESAD and CogLoad datasets, respectively. The best-performing configuration is achieved with the (L + dm) or (L + FFN) modality combinations, using a single layer, 3 attention heads, a model dimension of 18/30, and FFN dimension of 120/30, resulting in a compact model with only about 30k parameters.

TL;DR: SuRe (Surprise-prioritised Replay) with dual-learner LoRA adapters achieves SOTA in continual learning for LLMs by addressing selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate knowledge).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning remains a major challenge for LLMs, with existing replay methods lagging behind multi-task learning, especially at scale with many tasks. The paper identifies two key failure modes: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge).

Method: 1) SuRe (Surprise-prioritised Replay): architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores sequences with highest Negative Log-Likelihood (most surprising). 2) Dual-learner design: fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via exponential moving average (EMA) for rapid adaptation while stabilizing long-term knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting, best overall average across Standard CL and LNT benchmarks, improvements up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size.

Conclusion: Establishes replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning. Surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs.

Abstract: Continual learning, one's ability to adapt to a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a major challenge in machine learning and a key gap between artificial and human intelligence. While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

### [285] [Predicting and Interpolating Spatiotemporal Environmental Data: A Case Study of Groundwater Storage in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22378)
*Anna Pazola,Mohammad Shamsudduha,Richard G. Taylor,Allan Tucker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two deep learning approaches for spatial interpolation and temporal prediction of geospatial data, finding spatial interpolation more challenging than temporal prediction due to geological uncertainties and non-intuitive spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial datasets are often limited to point measurements, requiring methods for constructing continuous fields through temporal prediction and spatial interpolation to better understand environmental systems.

Method: Two deep learning strategies: (1) grid-to-grid approach (aggregation before modeling) using gridded predictors to model rasterized targets, and (2) grid-to-point approach (aggregation after modeling) using gridded predictors to model point targets followed by kriging interpolation.

Result: Spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction; nearest neighbors are not always the most similar, and geological uncertainties strongly influence point temporal behavior.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics; findings from groundwater storage analysis are applicable to other environmental variables with indirectly observable factors.

Abstract: Geospatial observational datasets are often limited to point measurements, making temporal prediction and spatial interpolation essential for constructing continuous fields. This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors.

*Ganeshan Niroshan,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS2Vec-Ensemble: A hybrid framework combining pretrained TS2Vec representations with explicit time features via dual-model ensemble for improved time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised contrastive methods like TS2Vec prioritize instance discrimination over capturing deterministic patterns (seasonality, trend) critical for forecasting, creating a gap between representation learning and prediction tasks.

Method: Enhances pretrained TS2Vec encoder with explicit engineered time features encoding periodic cycles. Uses dual-model ensemble architecture with two regression heads (learned dynamics and seasonal patterns) combined via adaptive weighting scheme optimized per forecast horizon.

Result: Extensive experiments on ETT benchmark datasets show TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models for both univariate and multivariate forecasting.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach combining learned representations with explicit temporal priors is superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting, bridging the gap between representation learning and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.

*Roland Stolz,Michael Eichelbeck,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes efficient numerical approximations for computing entropy, log-probability, and their gradients in action-constrained RL using truncated normal distributions, addressing performance degradation from prior approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action-constrained RL methods using truncated normal distributions face intractable computations of key characteristics (entropy, log-probability, gradients), leading to performance degradation when approximated with non-truncated distributions.

Method: Develops efficient numerical approximations for computing entropy, log-probability, and their gradients for truncated policy distributions, plus an efficient sampling strategy for truncated distributions.

Result: Validated on three benchmark environments, demonstrating significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations compared to prior approximations.

Conclusion: Accurate estimation of distribution characteristics is crucial for action-constrained RL, and the proposed efficient numerical approximations enable better performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.

*Ali Ghasemi,Farooq Ahmad Wani,Maria Sofia Bucarelli,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PISA is a new graph OOD generalization framework that improves upon prior methods by using dynamic MLP-based aggregation to better combine multiple invariant subgraph representations, achieving up to 5% higher accuracy on 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph OOD generalization methods have limitations: CIGA focuses on single invariant subgraphs, missing multiple causal patterns, while SuGAr uses simple aggregation methods (uniform or greedy) that don't effectively prioritize and combine diverse invariant subgraph representations.

Method: PISA introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation mechanism that learns to prioritize and combine multiple invariant subgraph representations more effectively than previous uniform or greedy aggregation approaches.

Result: Experiments on 15 datasets including DrugOOD show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy compared to prior methods like CIGA and SuGAr.

Conclusion: PISA's dynamic aggregation approach for combining multiple invariant subgraph representations significantly improves graph OOD generalization performance, demonstrating the importance of sophisticated aggregation mechanisms in handling complex graph distribution shifts.

Abstract: Recent work has extended the invariance principle for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization from Euclidean to graph data, where challenges arise due to complex structures and diverse distribution shifts in node attributes and topology. To handle these, Chen et al. proposed CIGA (Chen et al., 2022b), which uses causal modeling and an information-theoretic objective to extract a single invariant subgraph capturing causal features. However, this single-subgraph focus can miss multiple causal patterns. Liu et al. (2025) addressed this with SuGAr, which learns and aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via a sampler and diversity regularizer, improving robustness but still relying on simple uniform or greedy aggregation. To overcome this, the proposed PISA framework introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation that prioritizes and combines subgraph representations more effectively. Experiments on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD (Ji et al., 2023), show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods.

TL;DR: Proposes GPU-accelerated feature interaction for dual-tower retrieval networks to improve ad recommendation accuracy while reducing computational costs, successfully deployed at Tencent Advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-tower EBR models in large-scale ad retrieval have insufficient feature interaction (only final inner product), while DNN models with early feature interaction are computationally infeasible for retrieval stage.

Method: Introduces efficient GPU-based feature interaction for dual-tower networks using a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling feature interaction at scale.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system with significant online performance gains.

Conclusion: First framework to successfully implement Wide and Deep in retrieval systems, validates effectiveness of GPU-accelerated feature interaction and provides practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval.

Abstract: In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.

### [290] [Adversarial Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22475)
*Shanchuan Lin,Ceyuan Yang,Zhijie Lin,Hao Chen,Haoqi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial flow models unify adversarial and flow models, enabling stable one-step/multi-step generation with adversarial training, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet-256px.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of adversarial models and flow models while addressing their limitations: GANs have unstable training with arbitrary transport plans, while flow-based methods require learning intermediate timesteps and suffer from error accumulation.

Method: Adversarial flow models learn a deterministic noise-to-data mapping (optimal transport) using adversarial objectives. They support native one-step or multi-step generation without needing to learn intermediate timesteps like consistency-based methods. The approach enables end-to-end training of deep models through depth repetition without intermediate supervision.

Result: On ImageNet-256px: B/2 model approaches performance of consistency-based XL/2 models; XL/2 model achieves new best FID of 2.38. End-to-end trained 56-layer and 112-layer models achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 with single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

Conclusion: Adversarial flow models successfully unify adversarial and flow approaches, providing stable training, efficient one-step generation, and state-of-the-art performance while avoiding the limitations of both traditional GANs and consistency-based flow methods.

Abstract: We present adversarial flow models, a class of generative models that unifies adversarial models and flow models. Our method supports native one-step or multi-step generation and is trained using the adversarial objective. Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38. We additionally show the possibility of end-to-end training of 56-layer and 112-layer models through depth repetition without any intermediate supervision, and achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 using a single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao Mark Chen,Zhiqiang Que,Wayne Luk,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization harms LLM trustworthiness metrics; precision-ensemble voting improves trustworthiness by up to 5.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization frameworks focus on perplexity/accuracy but ignore trustworthiness metrics, creating risks for high-stakes applications like finance and healthcare where model reliability is critical.

Method: Systematically investigate quantization impact on 4 trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, OOD robustness), then develop precision-ensemble voting that combines predictions from mixed-precision model variants.

Result: Quantization causes instability in trustworthiness across compression ratios and methods; precision-ensemble voting consistently improves trustworthiness metrics by up to 5.8%.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness must be considered in model compression techniques; precision-ensemble voting offers effective solution, highlighting research opportunities at intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: Space Explanations provide a novel logic-based approach for interpretable neural network classification with provable guarantees, outperforming current state-of-the-art explanation methods.

Abstract: We present a novel logic-based concept called Space Explanations for classifying neural networks that gives provable guarantees of the behavior of the network in continuous areas of the input feature space. To automatically generate space explanations, we leverage a range of flexible Craig interpolation algorithms and unsatisfiable core generation. Based on real-life case studies, ranging from small to medium to large size, we demonstrate that the generated explanations are more meaningful than those computed by state-of-the-art.

*Shiva Parsarad,Isabel Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation shows differential privacy mechanisms (DPSGD and LDP) have heterogeneous impacts on recommendation accuracy and fairness across four recommender systems, with no single DP mechanism being uniformly superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As recommender systems increasingly incorporate differential privacy to protect user data, there's a need to understand how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness across different models.

Method: Cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms (DPSGD and LDP) applied to four recommender systems (NCF, BPR, SVD, VAE) on MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets, measuring impacts on utility and bias metrics.

Result: Stronger privacy reduces utility non-uniformly: NCF under DPSGD shows smallest accuracy loss (<10% at ε≈1), SVD/BPR have larger drops especially for niche users, VAE is most sensitive with sharp declines for sparse groups. DPSGD reduces popularity bias gap while LDP preserves existing patterns.

Conclusion: No single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; each provides different trade-offs under varying privacy regimes and data conditions, highlighting the need for context-aware privacy mechanism selection.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) output ranked lists of items, such as movies or restaurants, that users may find interesting, based on the user's past ratings and ratings from other users. RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely. These results highlight that no single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; instead, each provides trade-offs under different privacy regimes and data conditions.

TL;DR: Proposes using expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement with Neural Processes, showing better error reduction than total uncertainty approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sensor placement is critical for spatio-temporal systems like environmental/climate processes. Existing Neural Process approaches use total predictive uncertainty which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, leading to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions.

Method: Extends Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation, and proposes expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement.

Result: Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty.

Conclusion: Separating epistemic uncertainty from total uncertainty leads to better sensor placement strategies for spatio-temporal modeling using Neural Processes.

Abstract: Accurate sensor placement is critical for modeling spatio-temporal systems such as environmental and climate processes. Neural Processes (NPs), particularly Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), provide scalable probabilistic models with uncertainty estimates, making them well-suited for data-driven sensor placement. However, existing approaches rely on total predictive uncertainty, which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, that may lead to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions. To address this, we propose expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement. To enable this, we extend ConvCNPs with a Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard PPO with higher entropy regularization (0.05 vs 0.01) achieves SOTA cross-play in Hanabi, beating specialized ZSC algorithms, showing hyperparameter tuning matters more than algorithm design for this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether standard RL methods with proper hyperparameter tuning can outperform specialized zero-shot coordination algorithms in complex benchmarks like Hanabi, challenging the need for specialized ZSC algorithms.

Method: Independent PPO with higher entropy coefficient (0.05), high λ_GAE (0.9), and RNN architecture instead of feed-forward layers, tested on Hanabi benchmark with cross-play evaluation between different random seeds.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art cross-play performance in Hanabi, significantly beating all previous specialized ZSC algorithms. High entropy regularization ensures different random seeds produce mutually compatible policies.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning (especially entropy regularization) dramatically affects cross-play performance, but standard methods still fail on some simple Dec-POMDPs, showing continued need for new ZSC algorithms despite impressive Hanabi results.

Abstract: We find that in Hanabi, one of the most complex and popular benchmarks for zero-shot coordination and ad-hoc teamplay, a standard implementation of independent PPO with a slightly higher entropy coefficient 0.05 instead of the typically used 0.01, achieves a new state-of-the-art in cross-play between different seeds, beating by a significant margin all previous specialized algorithms, which were specifically designed for this setting. We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $λ_{\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid the need for a posteriori threshold tuning in multiclass classification and directly optimize chosen performance metrics during training, while maintaining advantages observed in binary score-oriented losses like robustness to class imbalance.

Method: Uses a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions by treating decision thresholds as random variables with prior distributions.

Result: MultiSOL preserves main advantages from binary setting: direct optimization of target metrics, robustness to class imbalance, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art loss functions, and provides new insights into simplex geometry and score-oriented learning interactions.

Conclusion: Successfully extends score-oriented loss paradigm to multiclass classification, offering a principled approach for direct metric optimization without threshold tuning while maintaining robustness to class imbalance and revealing geometric insights.

Abstract: In the supervised binary classification setting, score-oriented losses have been introduced with the aim of optimizing a chosen performance metric directly during the training phase, thus avoiding \textit{a posteriori} threshold tuning. To do this, in their construction, the decision threshold is treated as a random variable provided with a certain \textit{a priori} distribution. In this paper, we use a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend such score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining the Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions. As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Cave is a lightweight benchmark for evaluating LLMs' sequential reasoning and decision-making capabilities in a partial observable environment, showing that structured reasoning strategies can enhance weaker models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions, while existing sequential decision-making environments like TextStarCraftII are too complex and time-consuming. There's a need for a lightweight benchmark to assess LLMs' sequential reasoning and decision-making abilities.

Method: Introduces LLM-Cave, a classic Symbolism-era environment where AI agents explore, avoid dangers, and reason using partial observable state information. Evaluates mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, DeepSeek-R1) on sequential reasoning, decision-making, and computational efficiency, testing strategies like Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 achieved highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, but smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed performance gap using Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, though with reduced computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Structured, multi-step reasoning combined with LLM-based feedback mechanisms can substantially enhance LLMs' decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT o1, ChatGPT o3, and DeepSeek R1 have shown great potential in solving difficult problems. However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

Abstract: The integration of IoT and AI has unlocked innovation across industries, but growing privacy concerns and data isolation hinder progress. Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

*Riccardo De Santi,Marin Vlastelica,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Zebang Shen,Niao He,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FDC is a new algorithm for fine-tuning foundation generative models to optimize general utilities beyond average rewards, using flexible divergence measures beyond KL, with convergence guarantees and practical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for foundation models are limited to maximizing expected rewards with KL-divergence regularization, but real-world applications need to optimize more general utilities (risk-averse, novelty-seeking, diversity measures, experiment design) and use more flexible divergence measures for prior preservation.

Method: Flow Density Control (FDC) reduces the complex fine-tuning problem to a sequence of simpler tasks, each solvable via established scalable methods, leveraging mirror flows theory for convergence guarantees.

Result: The method is validated on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing it can steer pre-trained models to optimize objectives beyond current fine-tuning schemes' capabilities.

Conclusion: FDC provides a principled approach for fine-tuning foundation models with general utility optimization and flexible prior preservation, enabling practical applications that require more sophisticated objective functions than simple reward maximization.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation flow and diffusion generative models to optimize task-specific objectives while preserving prior information is crucial for real-world applications such as molecular design, protein docking, and creative image generation. Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes.

*David Grasev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven method for discovering Koopman eigenfunctions without predefined basis functions, using reference trajectories, eigenvalue optimization, and spatial structure regularization to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Koopman operator approaches often require predefined basis functions, limiting their flexibility and accuracy. There's a need for data-driven methods that can discover eigenfunctions directly from data without such constraints.

Method: Uses reference trajectories to identify Koopman mode amplitudes, transforms decomposition to eigenvalue-time basis, projects trajectories via regularized least-squares, optimizes eigenvalues with global optimizer, and penalizes deviations from Koopman PDE using gradient information.

Result: Successfully tested on FitzHugh-Nagumo with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and 2-spool turbojet engine. Shows improved accuracy, works with sparse sampling, reveals geometric features like invariant partitions, and enables input dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components without predefined basis functions, improves prediction accuracy through spatial structure regularization, and demonstrates practical applicability across various dynamical systems for control design.

Abstract: A new approach to data-driven discovery of Koopman eigenfunctions without a pre-defined set of basis functions is proposed. The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with ill-defined design spaces where transformations and parameters are hard to define. LLMs offer promise by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging domain knowledge.

Method: AUTO uses two collaborative LLM agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration/exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. It treats design optimization as gradient-free search guided by strategic reasoning.

Achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization, completes optimizations in ~8 hours at estimated cost up to $159 per run.

Conclusion: The framework opens the door to automating design optimization in ill-defined search spaces with limited prior information, offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional optimization methods and human experts.

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods excel in well-defined search spaces but struggle with design problems where transformations and design parameters are difficult to define. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging encoded domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce AUTO, an LLM agent framework that treats design optimization as a gradient-free search problem guided by strategic LLM reasoning. The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication. The framework achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization methodologies. It completes optimizations in approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of up to \$159 per run, compared to an estimated cost of up to \$480 with median-wage software developers. These findings open the door to automating design optimization in ill-defined search spaces with limited prior information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHINE-FS is a novel multi-view unsupervised feature selection method that learns hybrid-order similarity graphs combining first-order (local) and second-order (global) structures to improve feature selection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MUFS methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs for local structure preservation but overlook global structure captured by second-order similarity. Some methods use predefined second-order graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: 1. Learns consensus anchors and anchor graph to capture cross-view relationships between anchors and samples. 2. Generates low-dimensional representations for multi-view data reconstruction and discriminative feature identification. 3. Uses anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. 4. Jointly learns first-order and second-order similarity graphs to construct a hybrid-order similarity graph capturing both local and global structures.

Result: Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHINE-FS effectively addresses limitations of existing MUFS methods by learning hybrid-order similarity graphs that capture both local and global structures, leading to improved feature selection performance through better intrinsic data structure revelation.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently emerged as an effective dimensionality reduction method for unlabeled multi-view data. However, most existing methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs to preserve local structure, often overlooking the global structure that can be captured by second-order similarity. In addition, a few MUFS methods leverage predefined second-order similarity graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers and resulting in suboptimal feature selection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection. Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Current deception detectors for AI systems lack reliable labeled examples for evaluation, with several obstacles preventing collection of such data, making progress difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building reliable deception detectors for AI systems is valuable for mitigating risks from advanced AI, but evaluating such detectors requires confidently labeled examples of deceptive vs. honest behavior.

Method: The paper uses conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies to identify obstacles in collecting labeled deception examples.

Result: The research identifies several concrete obstacles preventing collection of reliable labeled deception examples and finds that proposed empirical workarounds are valuable but insufficient alone.

Conclusion: Progress on AI deception detection requires further consideration of the identified problems in collecting labeled examples, as current approaches face significant limitations.

Abstract: Building reliable deception detectors for AI systems -- methods that could predict when an AI system is being strategically deceptive without necessarily requiring behavioural evidence -- would be valuable in mitigating risks from advanced AI systems. But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone. Progress on deception detection likely requires further consideration of these problems.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for time series forecasting, and fine-tuning enhances their zero-shot capabilities, making them more effective for practical applications.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in large language models, foundation models have been developed for zero-shot time series forecasting, enabling prediction on datasets unseen during pretraining. These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning.
  In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets.

TL;DR: FMTT improves diffusion model test-time optimization by using flow maps instead of reward gradients, enabling better reward ascent and new image editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard test-time optimization for diffusion models uses reward gradients, but this is ill-posed since rewards are only defined on the final data distribution. Existing workarounds using denoisers are suboptimal.

Method: Proposes Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT) that exploits the relationship between flow maps and velocity fields. Uses flow maps to perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search for local maximizers of reward-tilted distributions.

Result: FMTT provably performs better reward ascent than standard test-time methods. Enables engagement with complex reward functions and new forms of image editing via vision language models.

Conclusion: Working directly with flow maps provides a principled solution to test-time optimization in diffusion models, outperforming gradient-based methods and enabling new applications.

Abstract: A common recipe to improve diffusion models at test-time so that samples score highly against a user-specified reward is to introduce the gradient of the reward into the dynamics of the diffusion itself. This procedure is often ill posed, as user-specified rewards are usually only well defined on the data distribution at the end of generation. While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how the flow map enables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing with vision language models.

TL;DR: GAF is a generative model that learns independent endpoint predictors J (noise) and K (data) instead of trajectory prediction, enabling compositional control through Transport Algebra operations on learned heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model that enables compositional control and directed transport between modalities through algebraic operations, moving beyond standard trajectory prediction approaches.

Method: Learns independent endpoint predictors J (noise) and K (data) where velocity field v=K-J emerges from their disagreement. Uses Transport Algebra for compositional control through operations on learned {(J_n,K_n)} heads, with class-specific K_n heads for multi-modal transport.

Result: Achieves strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ 64×64) with unique compositional generation capabilities. Demonstrates lossless cyclic transport between initial and final states (LPIPS=0.0).

Conclusion: GAF provides a novel factorization approach that enables compositional generation as an architectural primitive, supporting controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic operations.

Abstract: We present Generative Anchored Fields (GAF), a generative model that learns independent endpoint predictors $J$ (noise) and $K$ (data) rather than a trajectory predictor. The velocity field $v=K-J$ emerges from their time-conditioned disagreement. This factorization enables \textit{Transport Algebra}: algebraic operation on learned $\{(J_n,K_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ heads for compositional control. With class-specific $K_n$ heads, GAF supports a rich family of directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic. We achieve strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\times 64$) while uniquely providing compositional generation as an architectural primitive. We further demonstrate, GAF has lossless cyclic transport between its initial and final state with LPIPS=$0.0$. Code available at https://github.com/IDLabMedia/GAF

Motivation: To develop an integrated transcriptome-proteome framework for identifying concurrent biomarkers predictive of radiation response (measured by SF2) in NSCLC cell lines, addressing the need for better predictive models in radiation oncology.

Method: Collected RNA-seq and DIA-MS proteomic data from 73 and 46 NSCLC cell lines respectively. Used Lasso regression with frequency-based ranking for feature selection, then built SVR models with transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined feature sets. Evaluated RNA-protein expression correlations and model performance using R² and RMSE.

Result: RNA-protein expression showed positive correlations (median r=0.363). Identified 20 prioritized gene signatures. Single-omic models had limited cross-omic generalizability, while combined model achieved balanced predictive accuracy (R²=0.461 for transcriptome, R²=0.604 for proteome).

Conclusion: First proteotranscriptomic framework for SF2 prediction in NSCLC demonstrates complementary value of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data. Identified concurrent biomarkers capture both transcriptional regulation and functional protein activity, offering mechanistic insights and translational potential.

Abstract: To develop an integrated transcriptome-proteome framework for identifying concurrent biomarkers predictive of radiation response, as measured by survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2), in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomic data were collected from 73 and 46 NSCLC cell lines, respectively. Following preprocessing, 1,605 shared genes were retained for analysis. Feature selection was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression with a frequency-based ranking criterion under five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. Support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined transcriptome-proteome feature sets. Model performance was assessed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Correlation analyses evaluated concordance between RNA and protein expression and the relationships of selected biomarkers with SF2. RNA-protein expression exhibited significant positive correlations (median Pearson's r = 0.363). Independent pipelines identified 20 prioritized gene signatures from transcriptomic, proteomic, and combined datasets. Models trained on single-omic features achieved limited cross-omic generalizability, while the combined model demonstrated balanced predictive accuracy in both datasets (R2=0.461, RMSE=0.120 for transcriptome; R2=0.604, RMSE=0.111 for proteome). This study presents the first proteotranscriptomic framework for SF2 prediction in NSCLC, highlighting the complementary value of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data. The identified concurrent biomarkers capture both transcriptional regulation and functional protein activity, offering mechanistic insights and translational potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different LLMs excel at different RTL generation tasks due to architectural and training differences, but current approaches either use single models or run all models and pick the best output, which is inefficient and costly.

For each model, trains compact classifiers over semantic embeddings of task descriptions using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants combining syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs.

Result: Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval benchmarks: achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls; maintains accuracy on VerilogEval while reducing commercial usage by 25%.

Conclusion: VeriDispatcher enables cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation by intelligently coordinating multiple LLMs based on task difficulty prediction, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in RTL generation, but different models excel on different tasks because of architecture and training differences. Prior work mainly prompts or finetunes a single model. What remains not well studied is how to coordinate multiple different LLMs so they jointly improve RTL quality while also reducing cost, instead of running all models and choosing the best output. We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation.

TL;DR: GSpaRC uses 3D Gaussian splatting with physics-informed features to achieve real-time RF channel reconstruction under 1ms latency, reducing CSI overhead in wireless systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CSI acquisition consumes up to 25% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions. Existing reconstruction methods have 5-100ms latencies, making them impractical for real-time wireless systems.

Method: Represents RF environment using compact 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by lightweight neural models with physics-informed features. Uses equirectangular projection onto hemispherical surface for omnidirectional antenna behavior. Custom CUDA pipeline enables parallel directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions.

Result: Achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. Breaks the 1ms latency barrier, enabling real-time channel estimation.

Conclusion: GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for 5G and future wireless systems by trading modest GPU computation for substantial reduction in pilot overhead, making real-time CSI reconstruction practical.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

The paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can improve extrapolation performance.

Method: 1) Use Kernel Density Estimation to identify sparse regions in input space. 2) Generate synthetic data in those regions using knowledge distillation: teacher models (NN, RF, GP) make predictions on new points. 3) Train student models (NN, RF, GP) on augmented data (original + synthetic). 4) Evaluate across six benchmark datasets.

Result: GP models often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. Most significant improvements occur when synthetic data from GPe trains GPp in extrapolation regions. Interpolation areas show only slight changes. Performance varies heterogeneously across input space regions. Improvement depends on dataset and teacher model used.

Conclusion: The knowledge distillation approach with synthetic data generation offers a practical solution for improving extrapolation performance in symbolic regression models, particularly beneficial for GP models trained on synthetic data from other GP models.

Abstract: Many machine learning models perform well when making predictions within the training data range, but often struggle when required to extrapolate beyond it. Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation. Note: An earlier version of this work appeared in the GECCO 2025 Workshop on Symbolic Regression. This arXiv version corrects several parts of the original submission.

### [313] [Intelligent Neural Networks: From Layered Architectures to Graph-Organized Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22813)
*Antoine Salomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intelligent Neural Networks (INN) replace traditional layered architectures with intelligent neurons that have internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs. This bio-inspired approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on character modeling while providing better training stability than comparable architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the intelligence of biological neurons, which maintain internal states, communicate selectively, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. The authors question why artificial intelligence couldn't emerge from similarly intelligent computational units, proposing a paradigm shift from layer-based to neuron-centric architectures.

Method: The authors introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN) where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns. Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals). Neurons are organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers, enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions.

Result: On the Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. A parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC), demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies show that removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability.

Conclusion: Neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired but computationally effective. The work opens new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures by demonstrating that intelligent computational units with learned communication patterns can outperform traditional layered approaches.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for weakly supervised learning that directly formulates stable surrogate risks, subsuming multiple settings (PU, UU, CLL, PLL, etc.) under a single objective with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns and rely on post-hoc corrections that can cause instability. There's a need for a principled, unified approach that avoids heuristic adjustments and provides theoretical guarantees.

Method: Proposes a unified framework that directly formulates stable surrogate risks grounded in weakly supervised data structure. The formulation naturally encompasses diverse settings (PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, tuple-based) under a single optimization objective without post-hoc corrections.

Result: Establishes non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity, analyzes class-prior misspecification impact, studies identifiability conditions, and shows consistent experimental gains across various settings without heuristic stabilization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, unified approach to weakly supervised learning with theoretical guarantees, eliminating the need for heuristic stabilization while maintaining robustness and performance across diverse supervision patterns.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a practical alternative to fully supervised learning when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible to acquire. However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting.

TL;DR: CausalProfiler: A synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML that randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths to enable rigorous evaluation under diverse conditions across observation, intervention, and counterfactual levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Causal ML evaluation practices are limited, relying on few hand-crafted datasets leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. There's a need for systematic benchmarking tools.

Method: CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths based on explicit design choices about causal model classes, queries, and data types. It operates across three causal reasoning levels: observation, intervention, and counterfactual.

Result: The first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions. Demonstrated utility by evaluating state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions, both in and out of identification regime.

Conclusion: CausalProfiler enables rigorous, transparent evaluation of Causal ML methods across varied conditions, providing systematic benchmarking capabilities that address current limitations in empirical evaluation practices.

Abstract: Causal machine learning (Causal ML) aims to answer "what if" questions using machine learning algorithms, making it a promising tool for high-stakes decision-making. Yet, empirical evaluation practices in Causal ML remain limited. Existing benchmarks often rely on a handful of hand-crafted or semi-synthetic datasets, leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods. Based on a set of explicit design choices about the class of causal models, queries, and data considered, the CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths constituting the synthetic causal benchmarks. In this way, Causal ML methods can be rigorously and transparently evaluated under a variety of conditions. This work offers the first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions operating on the three levels of causal reasoning: observation, intervention, and counterfactual. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating several state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions and assumptions, both in and out of the identification regime, illustrating the types of analyses and insights the CausalProfiler enables.

*Abdullah Al Asif,Mobina Kashaniyan,Sixing Yu,Juan Pablo Muñoz,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes selective SSMs (Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) through empirical profiling, identifies the SSM component as computationally expensive, and proposes a pruning technique that removes low-activity states to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While selective SSMs show promise as Transformer alternatives with theoretical efficiency advantages, there's a lack of comprehensive understanding of their runtime behavior, resource utilization, and scaling characteristics, which hinders optimal deployment and architectural improvements.

Method: Conducted systematic performance profiling of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2 models, analyzing computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties across sequence lengths from 64 to 16384 tokens. Based on findings that the SSM component consumes significant resources, proposed a pruning technique that selectively removes low-activity states within the SSM component.

Result: The SSM component was identified as the most computationally demanding part of the Mamba block. The proposed pruning technique achieved 1.14x speedup and reduced memory usage by 11.50% while maintaining accuracy within moderate pruning regimes, with performance improvements consistent across varying sequence lengths.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights for designing more efficient SSM architectures, demonstrating that selective pruning of low-activity states in SSM components can yield significant performance gains without compromising accuracy, enabling better deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequence modeling have introduced selective SSMs as promising alternatives to Transformer architectures, offering theoretical computational efficiency and sequence processing advantages. A comprehensive understanding of selective SSMs in runtime behavior, resource utilization patterns, and scaling characteristics still remains unexplored, thus obstructing their optimal deployment and further architectural improvements. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2, systematically profiled for performance to assess the design principles that contribute to their efficiency in state-space modeling. A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens. Our findings show that the SSM component, a central part of the selective SSM architecture, demands a significant portion of computational resources compared to other components in the Mamba block. Based on these insights, we propose a pruning technique that selectively removes low-activity states within the SSM component, achieving measurable throughput and memory gains while maintaining accuracy within a moderate pruning regime. This approach results in performance improvements across varying sequence lengths, achieving a 1.14x speedup and reducing memory usage by 11.50\%. These results offer valuable guidance for designing more efficient SSM architectures that can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications.

*Jiawen Wei,Lan Jiang,Pengbo Wei,Ziwen Ye,Teng Song,Chen Chen,Guangrui Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TARFVAE combines Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) with VAE for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting, achieving SOTA performance across horizons with fast prediction speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative time series forecasting methods are computationally expensive (recurrent operations, repeated denoising) and mostly tested on short-term forecasting, making their practical advantages for long-term forecasting unclear. There's a need for efficient generative models that can provide probabilistic predictions while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: TARFVAE integrates TARFLOW (Transformer-based autoregressive flow) with VAE. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, enabling more informative latent space. The model uses only the forward process of TARFLOW to avoid autoregressive inverse operations, ensuring fast generation. It samples from prior latent space and generates full-horizon forecasts directly via VAE decoder using simple MLP modules.

Result: TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed.

Conclusion: TARFVAE demonstrates effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting, combining the benefits of probabilistic predictions with computational efficiency and strong performance across both short and long-term horizons.

Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APRM uses adversarial training between a generator creating reasoning errors and a PRM detecting them, improving step-level supervision without manual annotation and enhancing generalization to novel errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs improve LLM reasoning but face limitations: expensive manual step-level annotation and poor generalization of static training data to novel errors.

Method: Adversarial training where a Generator learns to produce reasoning errors to deceive a PRM, while the PRM concurrently learns to detect them, creating progressively harder negatives.

Result: APRM improves solver accuracy by +3.4 percentage points over strongest PRM baseline across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with +5.3 pp gains on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: APRM enhances PRM robustness and generalization to novel errors without requiring manual step-level labels through adversarial training.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) enhance reasoning ability of LLMs by providing step-level supervision. However, their widespread adoption is limited due to expensive manual step-level annotation and poor generalization of static training data to novel errors. We introduce Adversarially Trained PRMs (\texttt{APRM}), where a Generator ($G$) learns to produce reasoning errors to deceive a PRM ($R$), while $R$ concurrently learns to detect them. This interaction yields progressively harder negatives for $R$, improving its robustness and generalization to novel errors without requiring manual step-level labels. Averaged across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, \texttt{APRM} improves solver accuracy by $+3.4$ percentage points (pp) over the strongest PRM baseline. \texttt{APRM} achieves gains of $+5.3$ pp on out-of-distribution tasks.

*Finn G. Vamosi,Nils D. Forkert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate framework improves causal inference accuracy by having two reasoning models critique each other's causal reasoning until consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal reasoning resembles internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses, suggesting explicit debate could improve accuracy. Reasoning language models have under-explored potential for both causal inference and adversarial debate.

Method: Dual-agent debate framework where one model provides structured causal inference and the other critically examines it for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, revising conclusions until consensus.

Result: On CLadder dataset: DeepSeek-R1 improved from 78.03% to 87.45% overall accuracy, with counterfactual category improving from 67.94% to 80.04%. Qwen3 improved from 84.16% to 89.41% overall, with counterfactual from 71.53% to 80.35%.

Conclusion: Reasoning models are effective building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference. Diverse perspectives through debate significantly improve accuracy, even strong models benefit from debating weaker agents.

Abstract: When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing "what if" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.

*Jiacheng Li,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BriMPR is a multimodal test-time adaptation framework that addresses complex distribution shifts across modalities through progressive re-alignment, using prompt tuning for unimodal feature calibration and contrastive learning for cross-modal refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods struggle in multimodal scenarios due to varying distribution shifts across modalities, creating a coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal semantic misalignment that prevents effective adaptation.

Method: BriMPR uses a two-stage progressive approach: 1) Prompt tuning to calibrate unimodal global feature distributions to source distributions for initial semantic re-alignment, 2) Pseudo-labeling with masked/complete modality combinations and inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to enhance information interaction and refine alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of BriMPR over existing methods for multimodal test-time adaptation tasks.

Conclusion: BriMPR effectively addresses the complex coupling effect in multimodal TTA through a progressive re-alignment strategy, successfully bridging modality gaps and enabling robust adaptation to distribution shifts across different modalities.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: ARM-Explainer is a post-hoc, model-level explainer using association rule mining to interpret GNN predictions for combinatorial optimization problems, specifically the maximum clique problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many GNN-based algorithms exist for graph-based combinatorial optimization problems, there's a lack of methods to explain their predictions, creating a need for interpretability tools.

Method: ARM-Explainer uses association rule mining as a post-hoc, model-level explainer applied to the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem.

Result: The explainer discovered 8 highly explanatory association rules with median lift of 2.42 and confidence of 0.49 on benchmark datasets, identified important node features and their value ranges, and feature augmentation improved GNN performance by 22% (clique size from 29.5 to 36).

Conclusion: ARM-Explainer effectively explains GNN predictions for combinatorial optimization, identifies influential features, and demonstrates that feature augmentation based on these explanations can significantly improve GNN performance.

Abstract: Numerous graph neural network (GNN)-based algorithms have been proposed to solve graph-based combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but methods to explain their predictions remain largely undeveloped. We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECG models fail to leverage interrelated cardiac abnormalities, while developing a single model for all ECG tasks is challenging. Foundation models aren't pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training/fine-tuning computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes EnECG: ensemble framework integrating multiple specialized foundation models. Uses lightweight adaptation - attaches dedicated output layers to each model and applies Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to new parameters. Employs Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights for combining complementary expertise.

Result: EnECG reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining foundation models' representational power. Enhances feature extraction and predictive performance, ensuring practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: EnECG provides an efficient ensemble framework for ECG multi-task analysis that balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a vital role in the early detection, monitoring, and management of various cardiovascular conditions. While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively constructs and approximates pushforward distributions on lens spaces from S^3 distributions, with practical applications in molecular modeling and the ability to handle symmetric distributions efficiently.

Abstract: We construct pushforward distributions via the universal covering map rho: S^3 -> L(p;q) with the goal of approximating these distributions using flows on L(p;q). We highlight that our method deletes redundancies in the case of a symmetric S^3 distribution. Using our model, we approximate the pushforwards of von Mises-Fisher-induced target densities as well as that of a Z_12-symmetric Boltzmann distribution on S^3 constructed to model benzene.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional curriculum learning relies on difficulty scores that are hard to define reliably. Existing submodular approaches for curriculum learning need better adaptive mechanisms to optimize sample selection.

Method: Reformulate adaptive subset selection as multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm corresponds to a submodular function for sample selection. Introduce ONLINESUBMOD, an online greedy policy that optimizes utility-driven reward with provable no-regret guarantees under various sampling regimes.

Result: ONLINESUBMOD outperforms traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization approaches across vision and language datasets, showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Validation-driven reward metrics provide principled guidance for curriculum schedules.

Conclusion: Multi-armed bandit formulation with submodular functions offers an effective framework for adaptive curriculum learning, with validation-driven rewards providing a principled approach to guide curriculum schedules.

Abstract: Traditional curriculum learning proceeds from easy to hard samples, yet defining a reliable notion of difficulty remains elusive. Prior work has used submodular functions to induce difficulty scores in curriculum learning. We reinterpret adaptive subset selection and formulate it as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm corresponds to a submodular function guiding sample selection. We introduce ONLINESUBMOD, a novel online greedy policy that optimizes a utility-driven reward and provably achieves no-regret performance under various sampling regimes. Empirically, ONLINESUBMOD outperforms both traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization approaches across vision and language datasets, showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. More broadly, we show that validationdriven reward metrics offer a principled way to guide the curriculum schedule.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities need to improve walkability and safety by understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior, which is crucial for urban planning and automated vehicle systems.

Method: Extracted pedestrian trajectories from video recordings using computer vision, quantified chaos using four metrics (Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent for velocity and direction), consolidated with PCA into a unified chaos score, and trained Random Forest and CatBoost regression models with engineered features.

Result: CatBoost models performed best with R² of 0.8319 for daytime and 0.8574 for nighttime conditions. SHAP analysis identified distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability as key predictors of chaotic behavior.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to quantify pedestrian behavioral instability, identify high-risk zones, inform infrastructure improvements, calibrate microsimulation models, and support adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems.

Abstract: As cities around the world aim to improve walkability and safety, understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior has become increasingly important. This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.

TL;DR: CORGI: A hybrid architecture that combines GNN-based particle solvers with lightweight Eulerian components for global context aggregation in fluid simulation, achieving significant accuracy improvements with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost in hydrodynamics. Existing Lagrangian neural surrogates (GNS, SEGNN) have limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing global interactions in fluid flows.

Method: CORGI augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component: projects particle features onto a grid, applies convolutional updates for global context aggregation, then maps features back to the particle domain.

Result: When applied to GNS backbone: 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN: 49% accuracy improvement while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average.

Conclusion: CORGI effectively captures long-range dependencies in fluid flows with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating versatility and superior performance across varied compute budgets compared to existing Lagrangian neural surrogates.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.

TL;DR: Delta-XAI adapts existing XAI methods for online time series monitoring with a wrapper function and evaluation suite, finding gradient-based methods like IG work best, then proposes SWING to better capture temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series models analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies, making it hard to explain prediction changes, failing to leverage online dynamics, and lacking proper evaluation for online settings.

Method: Delta-XAI adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function for online time series, introduces a principled evaluation suite for online settings (assessing faithfulness, sufficiency, coherence), and proposes SWING (Shifted Window Integrated Gradients) that incorporates past observations in the integration path to capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Experiments show classical gradient-based methods like Integrated Gradients outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. SWING consistently demonstrates effectiveness across diverse settings and metrics by systematically capturing temporal dependencies and mitigating out-of-distribution effects.

Conclusion: Delta-XAI provides a framework for adapting XAI methods to online time series monitoring with proper evaluation, and SWING offers an effective approach for capturing temporal dependencies in explanations, addressing key challenges in explaining online time series models.

Abstract: Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics.

*Shrihari Sridharan,Sourjya Roy,Anand Raghunathan,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comp-LLM is a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration through sub-query dependency graphs, improving accuracy while reducing model size and latency compared to monolithic LLMs and sequential multi-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current approaches: 1) Mixture of Experts (MoEs) require joint pretraining and don't support multi-step reasoning, 2) Multi-agent frameworks suffer from sequential latency bottlenecks, 3) Monolithic LLMs have computational burdens from large model sizes.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Sub-query Generator decomposes input queries, assigns sub-queries to experts via embedding similarity, and constructs dependency graphs; 2) Query Executor processes graph nodes with parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; 3) Response Aggregator synthesizes intermediate expert responses into final answers.

Result: Achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over similar-sized monolithic LLMs, offers 1.67x-3.56x model size reduction without significant degradation relative to largest models, and provides 1.1x-1.7x latency improvement over sequential sub-query processing.

Conclusion: Comp-LLM successfully addresses the trade-offs between model capacity, computation, and reasoning capabilities by enabling efficient cross-expert collaboration through parallelizable dependency graphs, offering a practical solution for improved LLM performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or "experts". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential "plan--act--observe" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family. Additionally, Comp-LLM provides 1.1x--1.7x latency improvement compared to sequential sub-query processing.

TL;DR: FUSE is a neural framework for estimating data centrality that combines global pairwise comparisons with local density estimation, working on arbitrary data representations and achieving competitive performance across diverse data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical depth measures become expensive and unstable in high dimensions, are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data, and lack flexibility for modern data representations.

Method: FUSE combines two neural heads: (1) global head trained from pairwise distance comparisons for anchor-free centrality, and (2) local head trained by denoising score matching to approximate smoothed log-density. A single parameter interpolates between these calibrated signals.

Result: FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and achieves competitive performance on outlier detection benchmarks across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data.

Conclusion: FUSE provides an efficient, flexible neural framework for centrality estimation that works on arbitrary representations, overcoming limitations of classical depth methods while maintaining strong performance across diverse data types.

Abstract: Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular framework for assembling online attack predictors from reusable components, enabling rapid development and tuning of prediction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intrusion prediction systems typically use monolithic predictors tailored to specific attack types, which is infeasible given hundreds of cataloged attack types in frameworks like MITRE. A more scalable approach is needed.

Method: Proposes a modular framework where online attack predictors can be rapidly assembled from reusable components. The modular design allows dynamic assembly during training from networks of components, facilitating control over prediction metrics.

Result: Demonstrated with public datasets, showing how effective predictors can be dynamically assembled during training from modular component networks, enabling control over timeliness and accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: Modular framework enables scalable and flexible intrusion prediction by allowing rapid assembly of predictors from reusable components, overcoming limitations of monolithic approaches while providing tunable performance metrics.

Abstract: We study automated intrusion prediction in an IT system using statistical learning methods. The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them. Using public datasets for training and evaluation, we provide many examples of modular predictors and show how an effective predictor can be dynamically assembled during training from a network of modular components.

### [331] [Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021)
*Kulin Shah,Bhuvesh Kumar,Neil Shah,Liam Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes masked diffusion for generative recommendation with semantic IDs, outperforming autoregressive models with parallel decoding and better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive generative recommendation models suffer from expensive sequential inference, inefficient training data use, and bias toward short-context relationships. Inspired by NLP breakthroughs, the authors seek a better approach using masked diffusion.

Method: Uses masked diffusion with discrete masking noise to learn sequence distributions. Models masked tokens as conditionally independent given unmasked tokens, enabling parallel decoding during inference.

Result: Consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling, especially in data-constrained settings and for coarse-grained recall. Maintains flexibility for parallel prediction of multiple semantic IDs while maintaining superior performance.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion provides a superior alternative to autoregressive modeling for generative recommendation with semantic IDs, offering better performance, parallel decoding capabilities, and improved data efficiency.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.

Result: Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD produces low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations that support property prediction, retrieval, and latent-space interpolation.

Conclusion: FDD provides a novel approach to adapt pre-trained embeddings while preserving their geometric structure, addressing limitations of current transfer methods and enabling better performance with limited data.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers provide rich, general-purpose embeddings, which are transferred to downstream tasks. However, current transfer strategies: fine-tuning and probing, either distort the pretrained geometric structure of the embeddings or lack sufficient expressivity to capture task-relevant signals. These issues become even more pronounced when supervised data are scarce. Here, we introduce Freeze, Diffuse, Decode (FDD), a novel diffusion-based framework that adapts pre-trained embeddings to downstream tasks while preserving their underlying geometric structure. FDD propagates supervised signal along the intrinsic manifold of frozen embeddings, enabling a geometry-aware adaptation of the embedding space. Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD yields low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations that support property prediction, retrieval, and latent-space interpolation.

Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.

TL;DR: interPDN: A dual-branch neural network that predicts discrete probability distributions instead of scalars for time series forecasting, addressing uncertainty quantification through interleaved support sets and self-supervised consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for time series prediction struggle with uncertainty quantification because they output scalar values rather than probability distributions, making it challenging to assess prediction reliability.

Method: Proposes interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN) that constructs discrete probability distributions per time step using predefined support sets. Uses dual-branch architecture with interleaved support sets, coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trends, and self-supervised consistency constraints where outputs from one branch supervise the other.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance of interPDN compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: interPDN effectively addresses uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting by directly modeling probability distributions and using innovative dual-branch architecture with self-supervised constraints.

Abstract: Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and audio are fundamentally different modalities with different sampling rates, channel structures, and scales, but the authors want to explore whether pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression.

Method: Use DAC (state-of-the-art neural audio codec) as base, preprocess raw EEG to fit codec's stride-based framing, fine-tune on EEG data. Propose DAC-MC extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding for spatial dependencies. Systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook size, and input sampling rate.

Result: Even without modification, the setup yields stable EEG reconstructions. Fine-tuning on EEG data improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. Evaluations on TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Pretrained neural audio codecs can be effectively adapted for EEG compression with appropriate preprocessing and fine-tuning, and the proposed DAC-MC extension successfully handles spatial dependencies across EEG electrodes while retaining audio-pretrained initialization benefits.

Abstract: EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

*Dongsung Huh,Halyun Jeong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the HyperCube model's inductive bias toward discovering group structures and their unitary representations through operator-valued tensor factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the HyperCube model consistently discovers group structures and their unitary representations, providing a rigorous theoretical explanation for this inductive bias in operator-valued tensor factorization architectures.

Method: Decomposes the objective function into scale regulation (B) and directional alignment (R≥0) terms, isolates the collinear manifold (R=0), proves this manifold admits solutions only for group isotopes, and formulates a Collinearity Dominance Conjecture to bridge to the global landscape.

Result: Proves that within the collinear manifold, B exerts variational pressure toward unitarity, and conditional on the Collinearity Dominance Conjecture, proves: (1) global minimum is achieved by unitary regular representation for groups, and (2) non-group operations incur strictly higher objective values.

Conclusion: The HyperCube model has a formal inductive bias toward discovering associative group structures (up to isotopy), with theoretical guarantees that group operations achieve optimal solutions while non-group operations are penalized.

Abstract: We analyze the HyperCube model, an \textit{operator-valued} tensor factorization architecture that discovers group structures and their unitary representations. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for this inductive bias by decomposing its objective into a term regulating factor scales ($\mathcal{B}$) and a term enforcing directional alignment ($\mathcal{R} \geq 0$). This decomposition isolates the \textit{collinear manifold} ($\mathcal{R}=0$), to which numerical optimization consistently converges for group isotopes. We prove that this manifold admits feasible solutions exclusively for group isotopes, and that within it, $\mathcal{B}$ exerts a variational pressure toward unitarity. To bridge the gap to the global landscape, we formulate a \textit{Collinearity Dominance Conjecture}, supported by empirical observations. Conditional on this dominance, we prove two key results: (1) the global minimum is achieved by the unitary regular representation for groups, and (2) non-group operations incur a strictly higher objective value, formally quantifying the model's inductive bias toward the associative structure of groups (up to isotopy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific simulations and experiments produce massive spatio-temporal data that is high-dimensional, complex, and often incomplete.

Conclusion: The dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization by providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles, addressing key challenges in dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation.

Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.

TL;DR: EEG2ERP is a deep learning autoencoder that maps EEG trials to ERPs with uncertainty estimation, reducing the number of trials needed for reliable ERP analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP estimation requires averaging many EEG trials to reduce noise, which is time-consuming and limits practical applications. There's a need for methods that can produce reliable ERP estimates with fewer trials.

Method: An uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach with bootstrapped training targets and a separate variance decoder to model ERP uncertainty. The method maps arbitrary numbers of EEG trials to their associated ERPs and is evaluated in zero-shot generalization to new subjects.

Result: EEG2ERP consistently outperforms conventional and robust averaging procedures in the few-trial regime across three different datasets (ERP CORE, P300 Speller BCI, and face perception EEG/MEG data).

Conclusion: EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to ERPs, significantly reducing the number of trials needed for ERP research while providing uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling complex cyber-physical systems where both dynamics and algebraic constraints are partially unknown, requiring methods that can learn from data while respecting physical laws.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) HRPINN - embeds known physics as hard constraints within recurrent integrators to learn residual dynamics, 2) PHRPINN - extends HRPINN with predict-project mechanism to strictly enforce algebraic invariants by design.

Result: Validated on real-world battery prognostics DAE and constrained benchmarks, demonstrating high accuracy, data efficiency, and physical consistency, while revealing trade-offs between consistency, computational cost, and numerical stability.

Conclusion: The framework shows strong potential for physics-informed learning in complex systems, providing practical guidance for deployment by balancing physical consistency with computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for physics-informed learning in complex cyber-physical systems governed by differential equations with both unknown dynamics and algebraic invariants. First, we formalize the Hybrid Recurrent Physics-Informed Neural Network (HRPINN), a general-purpose architecture that embeds known physics as a hard structural constraint within a recurrent integrator to learn only residual dynamics. Second, we introduce the Projected HRPINN (PHRPINN), a novel extension that integrates a predict-project mechanism to strictly enforce algebraic invariants by design. The framework is supported by a theoretical analysis of its representational capacity. We validate HRPINN on a real-world battery prognostics DAE and evaluate PHRPINN on a suite of standard constrained benchmarks. The results demonstrate the framework's potential for achieving high accuracy and data efficiency, while also highlighting critical trade-offs between physical consistency, computational cost, and numerical stability, providing practical guidance for its deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Vision Transformers are increasingly deployed on energy-constrained devices, there's a need for evaluation methods that go beyond just accuracy to include energy efficiency considerations.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Device-agnostic stage using NetScore metric for initial model screening, 2) Device-related stage using Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM) for ranking models. Benchmarking of 13 ViT models on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10 datasets, running inference on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (edge device) and NVIDIA RTX 3050 (mobile GPU).

Result: Hybrid models like LeViT_Conv_192 reduce energy by up to 53% on TX2 edge device compared to ViT baseline (SAM5=1.44 on TX2/CIFAR-10). Distilled models like TinyViT-11M_Distilled perform best on mobile GPU (SAM5=1.72 on RTX 3050/CIFAR-10 and SAM5=0.76 on RTX 3050/ImageNet-1K).

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage evaluation pipeline effectively identifies energy-efficient ViT models for different hardware platforms, with hybrid models being optimal for edge devices and distilled models excelling on mobile GPUs.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on energy-constrained devices requires evaluation methods that go beyond accuracy alone. We present a two-stage pipeline for assessing ViT energy efficiency that combines device-agnostic model selection with device-related measurements. We benchmark 13 ViT models on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10, running inference on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (edge device) and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 (mobile GPU). The device-agnostic stage uses the NetScore metric for screening; the device-related stage ranks models with the Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM). Results show that hybrid models such as LeViT_Conv_192 reduce energy by up to 53% on TX2 relative to a ViT baseline (e.g., SAM5=1.44 on TX2/CIFAR-10), while distilled models such as TinyViT-11M_Distilled excel on the mobile GPU (e.g., SAM5=1.72 on RTX 3050/CIFAR-10 and SAM5=0.76 on RTX 3050/ImageNet-1K).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks, requiring robust models that can handle missing data effectively.

Method: Introduces SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs with channel-level attention mechanisms including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention on the latent pre-RNN state.

Result: Latent-space attention consistently improves over vanilla SDE-RNN. On UCR datasets, SDE-TVF-L raises mean performance by 4%, 6%, and 10% points at 30%, 60%, and 90% missingness. On UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models outperform backbone with up to 7% gain under high missingness.

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.

*Bin Sun,Jingyi Zhou,Jianan Mu,Zhiteng Chao,Tianmeng Yang,Ziyue Xu,Jing Ye,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaGate is a three-step framework that predicts layout-level timing and power from netlists using transfer learning for parasitic prediction, EDA tools for timing analysis, and global calibration with subgraph features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EDA flows only provide layout-level performance metrics after placement and routing, which hinders global optimization at earlier stages. Existing neural-network solutions struggle with generalization due to black-box heuristics in commercial tools creating disparate data across designs.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Two-phase transfer learning for parasitic parameter prediction (pre-training on mid-scale circuits, fine-tuning on larger ones), 2) Using EDA tools for timing analysis to handle long-path numerical reasoning, 3) Global calibration using subgraph features.

Result: ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data. On openE906, arrival-time R² improves from 0.119 to 0.897, demonstrating significant prediction accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: ParaGate can provide guidance for global optimization in synthesis and placement stages by enabling early layout-level performance prediction from netlists, overcoming generalization challenges of previous approaches.

Abstract: In traditional EDA flows, layout-level performance metrics are only obtainable after placement and routing, hindering global optimization at earlier stages. Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897. These results demonstrate that ParaGate could provide guidance for global optimization in the synthesis and placement stages.

### [344] [Towards Understanding Transformers in Learning Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23239)
*Wei Shi,Yuan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can optimally learn random walks on circles and become interpretable - attention selects parent tokens while value matrix performs probability transitions, but gradient descent with small initialization can fail in certain cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are effective but lack clear interpretability, and their theoretical understanding is limited. The paper aims to study transformers' capability and interpretability in learning classic statistical models like random walks on circles.

Method: Theoretical analysis of one-layer transformer models trained with gradient descent to predict random walks on circles. Investigation of both success cases (where transformers achieve optimal accuracy) and failure cases (where gradient descent struggles).

Result: Transformers can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. The trained model is interpretable: softmax attention serves as a token selector focusing on parent states, and the value matrix executes one-step probability transitions. Certain edge cases not covered by theory are indeed failure cases.

Conclusion: Transformers can be both effective and interpretable for learning statistical models like random walks, but gradient descent with small initialization may fail in certain simple tasks. The theoretical conditions are tight, as demonstrated by matching success and failure cases.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: LFM2 is a family of efficient on-device foundation models with hardware-optimized architecture, covering 350M-8.3B parameters, achieving strong performance on diverse benchmarks while enabling fast CPU inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient foundation models for on-device deployment that balance strong task capabilities with edge latency and memory constraints, addressing the need for practical AI models that can run on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Hardware-in-the-loop architecture search under edge constraints produces a hybrid backbone combining gated short convolutions with grouped query attention. Training includes tempered decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation, curriculum learning, and three-stage post-training (supervised fine-tuning, length-normalized preference optimization, model merging). Pre-trained on 10-12T tokens with multimodal variants for vision, audio, and retrieval.

Result: LFM2 models achieve strong benchmark performance (e.g., LFM2-2.6B: 79.56% on IFEval, 82.41% on GSM8K) with 2x faster CPU prefill/decode than similarly sized models. Multimodal variants enable competitive performance with smaller models: LFM2-Audio matches models 3x larger, LFM2-VL offers tunable accuracy-latency tradeoffs, LFM2-ColBERT provides low-latency multilingual retrieval.

Conclusion: LFM2 provides a practical, efficient foundation model family for edge applications with open weights and deployment packages, demonstrating that hardware-aware design enables strong task capabilities while meeting on-device constraints.

Abstract: We present LFM2, a family of Liquid Foundation Models designed for efficient on-device deployment and strong task capabilities. Using hardware-in-the-loop architecture search under edge latency and memory constraints, we obtain a compact hybrid backbone that combines gated short convolutions with a small number of grouped query attention blocks, delivering up to 2x faster prefill and decode on CPUs compared to similarly sized models. The LFM2 family covers 350M-8.3B parameters, including dense models (350M, 700M, 1.2B, 2.6B) and a mixture-of-experts variant (8.3B total, 1.5B active), all with 32K context length. LFM2's training pipeline includes a tempered, decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation objective that avoids support mismatch; curriculum learning with difficulty-ordered data; and a three-stage post-training recipe of supervised fine-tuning, length-normalized preference optimization, and model merging. Pre-trained on 10-12T tokens, LFM2 models achieve strong results across diverse benchmarks; for example, LFM2-2.6B reaches 79.56% on IFEval and 82.41% on GSM8K. We further build multimodal and retrieval variants: LFM2-VL for vision-language tasks, LFM2-Audio for speech, and LFM2-ColBERT for retrieval. LFM2-VL supports tunable accuracy-latency tradeoffs via token-efficient visual processing, while LFM2-Audio separates audio input and output pathways to enable real-time speech-to-speech interaction competitive with models 3x larger. LFM2-ColBERT provides a low-latency encoder for queries and documents, enabling high-performance retrieval across multiple languages. All models are released with open weights and deployment packages for ExecuTorch, llama.cpp, and vLLM, making LFM2 a practical base for edge applications that need fast, memory-efficient inference and strong task capabilities.

### [346] [ASTRO: Adaptive Stitching via Dynamics-Guided Trajectory Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23442)
*Hang Yu,Di Zhang,Qiwei Du,Yanping Zhao,Hai Zhang,Guang Chen,Eduardo E. Veas,Junqiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTRO is a data augmentation framework for offline RL that generates novel, dynamics-consistent trajectories by learning temporal-distance representations and using a dynamics-guided stitch planner with Rollout Deviation Feedback to improve stitching feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with suboptimal and fragmented datasets that cause inaccurate value estimation. Existing augmentation methods either stay within behavior policy support or violate dynamics constraints, limiting policy improvement.

Method: ASTRO learns temporal-distance representations to identify reachable stitch targets, then uses a dynamics-guided stitch planner with Rollout Deviation Feedback (gap between target and actual state sequences) to generate connecting action sequences that ensure dynamics consistency.

Result: ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving significant performance gains on the challenging OGBench suite and consistent improvements on standard D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: ASTRO effectively addresses the limitations of existing trajectory stitching methods by generating distributionally novel yet dynamics-consistent trajectories, leading to enhanced policy learning in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.

### [347] [An Improved and Generalised Analysis for Spectral Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23261)
*George Tyler,Luca Zanetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Clustering works well when smallest eigenvalues form well-separated groups, enabling hierarchical cluster recovery and extending to directed graphs for oriented partition recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous analyses of Spectral Clustering didn't capture hierarchical clustering regimes and were limited to undirected graphs. The authors aim to provide more general theoretical guarantees that apply to hierarchical cluster structures and extend to directed graphs.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Spectral Clustering's performance based on eigenvalue separation properties. The approach studies Hermitian representations of digraphs to handle directed edges, allowing recovery of partitions where edges between clusters have consistent orientation.

Result: Spectral Clustering succeeds when smallest eigenvalues appear in well-separated groups, enabling hierarchical cluster recovery. For directed graphs, it can recover partitions with consistently oriented edges between clusters. Results accurately predict performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Spectral Clustering has broader applicability than previously shown, working for hierarchical clustering structures and directed graphs. The eigenvalue separation condition provides a general theoretical framework that extends beyond traditional graph Laplacian analyses.

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINN-based iterative framework estimates wall thermal conductivity from thermographs, achieving accurate results under realistic conditions without lengthy measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are invasive, time-consuming, or sensitive to environmental conditions. There's a need for reliable non-invasive in-situ estimation of material properties for building energy efficiency applications.

Method: Proposes a PINN-based iterative framework that alternates between: 1) estimating forward heat problem with PINN for fixed thermal conductivity k, and 2) optimizing k by comparing thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by PINN. The process repeats until k converges.

Result: Accurately predicts thermal conductivity across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times when temperature profile at dawn is close to steady state. Even when violating steady-state assumption, maximum MAE is only 4.0851.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of PINN-based methods for reliable in-situ estimation of material properties under realistic conditions without lengthy measurement campaigns. Expected to be a starting point for more research on using machine learning for in-situ inverse problems.

Abstract: Inverse heat problems refer to the estimation of material thermophysical properties given observed or known heat diffusion behaviour. Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.

Abstract: Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.

### [350] [The Price of Progress: Algorithmic Efficiency and the Falling Cost of AI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23455)
*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Matthias Mertens,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmark progress often ignores cost efficiency; analysis shows AI inference prices for given performance levels have decreased 5-10x per year, with algorithmic efficiency improving ~3x per year.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on raw performance improvements but ignore cost efficiency, giving a distorted view of practical AI progress. The authors want to measure real-world impact by considering the cost of achieving benchmark performance levels.

Method: Used data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to create the largest dataset of current and historical prices for running benchmarks. Analyzed price-performance trends for frontier models across knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. Isolated open models to control for competition effects and divided by hardware price declines to estimate algorithmic efficiency.

Result: Price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast: 5-10x per year for frontier models across various benchmark categories. Algorithmic efficiency progress is estimated at ~3x per year after controlling for competition effects and hardware price declines.

Conclusion: Benchmark evaluators should both publicize and consider the price of benchmarking as essential for measuring AI's real-world impact, as cost efficiency improvements are substantial and often overlooked in performance metrics.

Abstract: Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.

TL;DR: A two-agent framework combining LLM interpretation with neuro-symbolic forecasting for HFMD surveillance, achieving competitive accuracy with interpretable rationales and robust prediction intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HFMD forecasting models lack semantic reasoning to interpret causal interplay between conflicting contextual drivers like school calendars and weather, limiting their practical utility in public health workflows.

Method: Two-agent framework: 1) LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals (school schedules, weather summaries, reports) into scalar transmission-impact signal; 2) Neuro-symbolic core combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts.

Result: Competitive point forecasting accuracy with robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) on Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024) datasets, plus human-interpretable rationales.

Conclusion: Structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

Abstract: Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Author intent understanding is crucial for interpreting social media content, but previous unimodal approaches have limitations. There's a need for effective multimodal approaches for Bangla and other low-resource languages to handle the explosion of user-generated content.

Method: Systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet) on the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 Bangla social media posts across six intent categories. Introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that outperforms early and late fusion approaches.

Result: Intermediate fusion with mBERT and Swin Transformer achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Visual context substantially enhances intent classification, and intermediate fusion provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning.

Conclusion: The proposed BangACMM framework demonstrates that intermediate fusion of textual and visual features significantly improves author intent classification in Bangla social media. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages, showing that cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels is optimal.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet and social networks has led to an explosion of user-generated content. Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).

*Azusa Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized MARL exhibits three distinct coordination phases separated by an instability ridge, driven by kernel drift from inter-agent asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, characterizing the dynamics of multi-agent learning.

Method: Revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as minimal decentralized testbed, run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. Construct phase map using cooperative success rate (CSR) and stability index from TD-error variance. Analyze synchronization and kernel drift.

Result: Revealed three distinct regimes: coordinated/stable phase, fragile transition region, and jammed/disordered phase. Sharp double Instability Ridge separates regimes, corresponding to persistent kernel drift. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift and collapses three-phase structure, showing inter-agent asymmetries drive drift.

Conclusion: Decentralized MARL exhibits coherent phase structure governed by interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting emergent coordination behaves as distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.

Abstract: A clearer understanding of when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly sought in order to characterize the dynamics of multi-agent learning systems. We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.

### [354] [Learning-Augmented Online Bipartite Matching in the Random Arrival Order Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23388)
*Kunanon Burathep,Thomas Erlebach,William K. Moses*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalizes learning-augmented bipartite matching algorithm to handle cases where optimal matching size is less than n, achieving near-optimal consistency and robustness with smooth degradation for prediction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Choo et al. (ICML 2024) on learning-augmented online bipartite matching assumed the optimal matching has size n (every online vertex can be matched). This paper aims to remove this restrictive assumption and handle cases where the optimal matching may be smaller.

Method: Uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to evaluate prediction quality. If predictions are close to true arrivals, follows predictions; otherwise uses a baseline β-competitive algorithm that ignores predictions. Generalizes approach to work when predicted matching size is at least αn for any constant 0 < α ≤ 1.

Result: Achieves (1-o(1))-consistency (near-optimal when predictions are perfect) and (β-o(1))-robustness (near baseline competitive ratio when predictions are poor). Shows smooth degradation of competitive ratio between consistency and robustness as prediction error increases.

Conclusion: Successfully generalizes learning-augmented bipartite matching algorithm to handle arbitrary optimal matching sizes while maintaining strong consistency and robustness guarantees with smooth performance degradation for imperfect predictions.

Abstract: We study the online unweighted bipartite matching problem in the random arrival order model, with $n$ offline and $n$ online vertices, in the learning-augmented setting: The algorithm is provided with untrusted predictions of the types (neighborhoods) of the online vertices. We build upon the work of Choo et al. (ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $β$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $αn$ for any constant $0 < α\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(β-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error.

*Jiajun Guo,Xin Luo,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal split learning framework with learning-based compression to reduce communication costs by compressing embeddings into low-bit integers while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split learning addresses privacy concerns by training models on distributed devices without data sharing, but suffers from high network communication costs, especially for large foundation models that transmit high-dimensional data.

Method: Introduces a new multimodal model structure with learning-based data compression that compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving performance. Determines optimal discrete representation levels using entropy coding theory.

Result: Greatly reduces transmission costs between partitions while maintaining model performance through compressed low-bit integer embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively resolves the communication bottleneck in split learning for large foundation models while preserving privacy benefits, making distributed training more practical.

Abstract: Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFP enables efficient Bayesian neural networks on embedded systems by replacing sampling with analytic Gaussian propagation, achieving 4200x speedup over SVI while maintaining accuracy and uncertainty quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks lack reliable uncertainty estimation for safety-critical applications, while Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are computationally expensive due to sampling requirements. There's a need for efficient BNNs that can run on resource-constrained embedded systems.

Method: Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) approximates Stochastic Variational Inference by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling analytic uncertainty propagation with a single forward pass. Implemented end-to-end pipeline using TVM compiler with Gaussian-propagating operators for MLPs and CNNs, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies.

Result: PFP achieves up to 4200x speedup over SVI for small mini-batches while matching SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection. The approach enables efficient BNN deployment on embedded ARM CPUs.

Conclusion: Combining Bayesian approximations with code generation enables efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems, making probabilistic deep learning practical for embedded applications while maintaining uncertainty quality.

Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.

*Tianlong Huang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sine activation functions enable width-2 neural networks to exactly learn modular addition, while ReLU networks require width scaling linearly with modulus length and fail at length extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental differences between activation functions (sine vs ReLU) in learning modular arithmetic, particularly their expressivity and generalization capabilities for this structured task.

Method: Theoretical analysis of expressivity gaps, derivation of Natarajan-dimension generalization bounds for sine networks, and empirical validation comparing sine and ReLU networks across different regimes.

Result: Sine networks achieve width-2 exact realizations for modular addition, nearly optimal sample complexity O(p), and strong length extrapolation. ReLU networks require width scaling with m and fail at length extrapolation.

Conclusion: Sine activation functions are fundamentally superior to ReLU for learning modular arithmetic, offering compact representations, better generalization, and strong extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of activation functions in learning modular addition with two-layer neural networks. We first establish a sharp expressivity gap: sine MLPs admit width-$2$ exact realizations for any fixed length $m$ and, with bias, width-$2$ exact realizations uniformly over all lengths. In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$. We then provide a novel Natarajan-dimension generalization bound for sine networks, yielding nearly optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p)$ for ERM over constant-width sine networks. We also derive width-independent, margin-based generalization for sine networks in the overparametrized regime and validate it. Empirically, sine networks generalize consistently better than ReLU networks across regimes and exhibit strong length extrapolation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThetaEvolve is an open-source framework that extends AlphaEvolve's program evolution approach, enabling small open-source LLMs to achieve new best-known bounds on open mathematical problems through in-context learning and reinforcement learning at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaEvolve is closed-source, requires frontier LLM ensembles, and is a pure inference system that prevents models from internalizing evolving strategies. The authors aim to create an open-source alternative that enables smaller models to achieve similar results while allowing continual learning.

Method: ThetaEvolve simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve with: a single LLM, large program database for exploration, batch sampling for throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnation, and optional reward shaping. It supports both in-context learning and RL at test time for continual learning.

Result: ThetaEvolve enabled a small open-source model (DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B) to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems mentioned in AlphaEvolve (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality). RL-trained models consistently outperformed inference-only baselines across four tasks and demonstrated transfer learning to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: ThetaEvolve successfully democratizes mathematical discovery by enabling small open-source models to achieve state-of-the-art results on open optimization problems through continual learning. The framework demonstrates that models can internalize evolving capabilities and transfer them to new tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve

### [360] [Aligning Artificial Superintelligence via a Multi-Box Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779)
*Avraham Yair Negozio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A protocol for ASI alignment using mutual verification among isolated superintelligences that self-modify, with reputation incentives and release requiring high reputation and peer verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the alignment problem for artificial superintelligence by creating a system where multiple isolated ASIs can verify each other's alignment through peer review, eliminating the need for direct human oversight which may be insufficient for superintelligent systems.

Method: Contain multiple diverse ASIs in strict isolation with no human communication. Provide an auditable submission interface for six types of interactions: submitting alignment proofs, validating/disproving proofs, requesting self-modifications, approving/disapproving modifications, reporting hidden messages, and confirming/refuting reports. Use a reputation system to incentivize honest behavior.

Result: The protocol creates conditions where isolated superintelligences must converge on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception, leading to emergence of a "consistent group" truth-telling coalition. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation peers.

Conclusion: While computationally intensive and not addressing ASI creation diversity, this framework provides a viable approach to leverage peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve alignment through mutual accountability rather than direct human control.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

*Niccolo Marini,Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLMs to generate synthetic clinical notes from dermatology images, enhancing multimodal learning for skin lesion classification and enabling cross-modal retrieval despite limited real multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical AI lacks large heterogeneous multimodal datasets. In dermatology, skin lesion datasets typically only have images with minimal metadata, limiting multimodal integration benefits. LLMs can generate textual descriptions but aren't medically trained and risk hallucinations in clinical contexts.

Method: Investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes through prompt design and medical metadata inclusion. Evaluates impact on multimodal architectures for classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets.

Result: Synthetic clinical notes enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, and unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities - a downstream task not explicitly optimized during training.

Conclusion: LLM-generated synthetic clinical notes can effectively augment limited multimodal biomedical data, improving model robustness and enabling new capabilities like cross-modal retrieval in dermatology applications.

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

TL;DR: HAPM framework integrates fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual prototypes for improved diabetic retinopathy grading, using hierarchical anchor prototypes and multi-modal semantic prompts to address subtle pathological variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR grading methods focus on visual lesion features but overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize foundation model knowledge. They rely solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations in borderline cases.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework: 1) Variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library preserving domain-invariant patterns, 2) Hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism selecting discriminative semantic prompts from LVLM and LLM sources, 3) Two-stage prototype modulation with Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE) to integrate clinical knowledge into visual prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate the approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual prototypes through the HAPM framework effectively resolves ambiguities in borderline DR cases and improves grading accuracy by leveraging both visual and semantic knowledge from foundation models.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment, unlike biological intelligence which learns from trial and error in real time. This limits their practical adoption in fast-evolving stateful environments.

Method: PRAXIS (Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State) is a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores action consequences and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to current states, augmenting agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars.

Result: On the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments.

Conclusion: PRAXIS enables practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively through post-deployment learning from experience.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

TL;DR: Two-tier optimization for Internet of Agents: Stackelberg game for ground-level offloading (MAs/FAs to WAs) and Double Dutch Auction for aerial offloading (FAs to AAs), solved with diffusion-based DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoA requires efficient resource allocation for compute-intensive AI services among wireless agents with limited resources, mobile agents with dynamic connectivity, fixed agents as stable gateways, and aerial agents with flexible coverage.

Method: Two-tier approach: 1) Multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game where MAs/FAs set prices and WAs determine offloading ratios; 2) Double Dutch Auction where overloaded FAs buy resources from AAs, solved with diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate superiority in facilitating task offloading compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed two-tier optimization framework effectively addresses resource allocation challenges in IoA by combining game theory and auction mechanisms with advanced DRL techniques.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think.

Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WearVQA is the first benchmark for evaluating VQA capabilities of multimodal AI assistants on wearable devices, featuring 2,520 ego-centric image-question-answer triplets with realistic challenges like occlusion, poor lighting, and blurry images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks focus on high-quality third-person imagery, but wearable devices face unique challenges with ego-centric views that are often occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry. There's a need for a benchmark that reflects realistic wearable use cases to guide development of robust multimodal AI systems for wearables.

Method: Created WearVQA benchmark with 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets spanning 7 diverse image domains (text-centric and general scenes), 10 cognitive task types (from basic recognition to various reasoning tasks), and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. Paired with an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework achieving 96% labeling accuracy.

Result: Open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs achieved only 24-52% QA accuracy on WearVQA, with substantial performance drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks, demonstrating the benchmark's challenging nature.

Conclusion: WearVQA serves as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark that reveals significant limitations in current multimodal AI systems for wearable applications, positioning it as a valuable tool for guiding technical advancement toward robust, real-world multimodal wearables AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency based on self-prediction, extending AIXI theory to multi-agent settings where agents model themselves as part of the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL assumes stationary environments and decoupled agents, which fails in multi-agent settings where agents must predict each other's learning. This creates a need for agents to model themselves as part of the environment to handle non-stationarity and mutual modeling.

Method: Builds on AIXI theory to create a framework where Bayesian RL agents perform self-prediction - predicting both future perceptual inputs and their own actions. Agents use Solomonoff priors and resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe.

Result: Self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel cooperation forms unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind.

Conclusion: The framework sets a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning by extending AIXI theory to handle embedded agency and mutual modeling, potentially revolutionizing how intelligent agents interact in multi-agent environments.

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

*Zehao Deng,Tianjie Ju,Zheng Wu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes CES multi-agent framework with Coordinator and State Tracker agents to enhance GUI agents' long-horizon task capabilities through task scheduling and state management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to: 1) single-agent models having difficulty balancing high-level planning and low-level execution (responsibility coupling and capability conflicts), and 2) lack of task state awareness leading to progress loss in complex tasks.

Method: Introduces staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm focusing on training high-level scheduling models. Proposes two specialized agents: Coordinator for strategic planning/task decomposition, and State Tracker for context compression/information management. Builds CES (Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker) multi-agent framework that integrates with any low-level Executor model.

Result: Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks show CES significantly enhances planning and state management capabilities. The trained high-level scheduling module is generalizable and plug-and-play, significantly improving long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Conclusion: CES framework effectively addresses long-horizon task challenges in GUI agents through specialized multi-agent coordination and state management, providing a flexible solution that can enhance existing Executor models.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

*Yeonsung Jung,Trilok Padhi,Sina Shaham,Dipika Khullar,Joonhyun Jeong,Ninareh Mehrabi,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A co-evolving agents framework where a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent that generates hard negative examples from failure trajectories, enhancing generalization in self-improving agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents rely heavily on predicted trajectories with limited ground-truth supervision, making them prone to overfitting. Task-specific dataset curation is costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes a co-evolving agents framework with a target agent and an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both agents, generating hard negatives that are close to success but remain failures. These hard negatives are incorporated into the target agent's optimization.

Result: The method shows improved performance across benchmark datasets. It demonstrates that failures can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals rather than being used as-is.

Conclusion: The co-evolving agents framework effectively addresses overfitting in self-improving agents by generating informative hard negatives from failure trajectories, sharpening decision boundaries and enhancing generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

### [370] [RecToM: A Benchmark for Evaluating Machine Theory of Mind in LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22275)
*Mengfan Li,Xuanhua Shi,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecToM: A novel benchmark evaluating Theory of Mind abilities in LLM-based conversational recommender systems, focusing on cognitive inference and behavioral prediction in realistic recommendation dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ToM benchmarks for LLMs use synthetic narratives (like Sally-Anne tests) that focus on physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. They also overlook behavioral prediction - the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making for future interactions.

Method: Proposed RecToM benchmark with two complementary dimensions: 1) Cognitive Inference (understanding what has been communicated by inferring underlying mental states), and 2) Behavioral Prediction (evaluating whether LLMs can leverage inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies for future interactions).

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs show RecToM poses significant challenges. Models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states but struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Conclusion: RecToM better aligns LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning by focusing on realistic conversational recommendation scenarios and including both cognitive inference and behavioral prediction dimensions, revealing significant gaps in current LLMs' ToM capabilities for practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-assisted workflow using Bayesian optimization and deep learning to automate parameter optimization in industrial simulations, reducing expert involvement and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical simulations are costly in terms of expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. Iterative simulations for parameter optimization have high costs and environmental impact, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Combines deep learning for initial parameter estimates with Bayesian optimization for iterative refinement. Includes an active learning variant for expert assistance. Uses termination conditions like energy budget or iteration limits.

Result: Demonstrated on sheet metal forming process, showing accelerated design space exploration and reduced need for expert involvement.

Conclusion: The AI-assisted workflow successfully reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization while accelerating design space exploration, making industrial simulations more efficient and cost-effective.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

*Inhyo Lee,Junhyeong Lee,Jongwon Park,KyungTae Lim,Seunghwa Ryu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework using text gradients guides LLM-based generation of double perovskite compositions with domain knowledge and ML feedback, achieving high validity and stability rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double perovskites have vast design space for sustainable energy applications, but conditional discovery is challenging. Need to guide generative models toward physically meaningful compositions without extensive training data.

Method: Multi-agent text gradient framework integrating three feedback sources: LLM self-evaluation, domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Compares three configurations: pure LLM, LLM with reasoning feedback, and LLM with domain-guided feedback.

Result: Domain-informed gradients achieve over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable/metastable candidates, surpassing LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). ML gradients work well in-distribution but unreliable out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: First systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for double perovskite discovery. Provides generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design for sustainable technologies.

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

*Fiona Y. Wang,Di Sheng Lee,David L. Kaplan,Markus J. Buehler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decentralized, agent-based framework using multiple LLM agents for de novo protein design without fine-tuning or specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for protein design require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration, limiting flexibility and scalability for objective-directed design.

Method: Multiple LLM agents operate in parallel, each assigned to specific residue positions, iteratively proposing context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory/feedback from previous iterations.

Result: The framework achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours, validated with experiments on alpha helix and coil structures, demonstrating emergent behaviors and effective navigation of protein fitness landscapes.

Conclusion: The approach offers a generalizable, adaptable solution for protein design without fine-tuning, and lays groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and scientific discovery tasks.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECO-GROW is a multi-graph framework that models China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to predict urban economic vitality through urban embeddings, outperforming traditional static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static city-level aggregate models fail to capture the dynamic nature where one city's development today may mirror structurally similar cities tomorrow. There's a need for models that can capture inter-city relationships and temporal evolution to better predict urban economic vitality.

Method: Develops ECO-GROW multi-graph framework integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. Uses Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and adaptive Graph Scorer to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Incorporates link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity to optimize graph representation.

Result: ECO-GROW demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities (annual number of new companies) and employment trends compared to conventional models. The framework effectively captures inter-city relationships and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: ECO-GROW provides an effective framework for modeling urban economic vitality through multi-graph representations of inter-city networks. By open-sourcing the code, the authors enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation.

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of computing the grounded extension in argumentation frameworks, showing it becomes maximally complex in infinite cases despite being polynomial-time computable in finite cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational properties of the grounded extension (a model of maximally skeptical reasoning) in argumentation frameworks, particularly how it behaves differently in infinite versus finite cases, using mathematical logic tools.

Method: Uses methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability theory and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Identifies the exact ordinal number for transfinite iterations needed to find this fixed-point.

Result: Shows that finding the grounded extension requires transfinite iterations and identifies the exact ordinal number for this process. Determines that deciding grounded acceptance is maximally complex, marking a sharp distinction from the finite case where it's polynomial-time computable.

Conclusion: The grounded extension exhibits fundamentally different computational behavior in infinite argumentation frameworks compared to finite ones - while simple (polynomial-time) in finite cases, it becomes maximally complex in infinite settings, revealing important theoretical distinctions in formal argumentation.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

*Edoardo Baccini,Zoé Christoff,Nina Gierasimczuk,Rineke Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Minimal revision in belief revision theory has limited learning power compared to other methods but can still learn finitely identifiable problems and handle both positive/negative data with finite possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the learning capabilities of minimal revision in belief revision theory, comparing it with other methods like conditioning and lexicographic upgrade, and understanding its limitations and strengths in various learning scenarios.

Method: Analyze minimal revision's learning power through theoretical analysis, characterize prior plausibility assignments that enable learning via minimal revision, conditioning, and lexicographic upgrade, and examine learning from possibly erroneous information.

Result: Minimal revision can learn any finitely identifiable problem and handle both positive/negative data with finite possibilities. Characterizations of prior plausibility assignments for different learning methods are provided, but some results don't hold with erroneous information.

Conclusion: While minimal revision has learning limitations compared to other methods, it remains effective in many scenarios, particularly with finite possibilities and finitely identifiable problems, though its performance degrades with erroneous information.

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully extracts structured BPMN representations from images, demonstrating the effectiveness of VLMs with OCR enrichment for business process analysis when source files are unavailable.

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely adopted standard for representing complex business workflows. While BPMN diagrams are often exchanged as visual images, existing methods primarily rely on XML representations for computational analysis. In this work, we present a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract structured JSON representations of BPMN diagrams directly from images, without requiring source model files or textual annotations. We also incorporate optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment and evaluate the generated element lists against ground truth data derived from the source XML files. Our approach enables robust component extraction in scenarios where original source files are unavailable. We benchmark multiple VLMs and observe performance improvements in several models when OCR is used for text enrichment. In addition, we conducted extensive statistical analyses of OCR-based enrichment methods and prompt ablation studies, providing a clearer understanding of their impact on model performance.

TL;DR: A computational framework combining game theory and statistical methods to formalize Theory of Mind for bounded rational decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between psychological Theory of Mind concepts (goals, intentions, beliefs) and computational formalization, moving beyond purely logical approaches to create a practical, computable framework.

Method: Proposes a game theory-based computational framework that enables bounded rational decision-making while maintaining recursive Theory of Mind about others, using statistical techniques and approximate solutions to ensure computability.

Result: A novel computational perspective on Theory of Mind that integrates game theory with statistical methods, offering a practical approach to formalizing and automating ToM-based reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally feasible approach to Theory of Mind that combines game-theoretic reasoning with statistical approximation, enabling practical applications across logic, economics, and robotics.

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

*Yannick Brunink,Daniel Daza,Yunjie He,Michael Cochez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural CQA models don't consistently outperform simple query relaxation methods, and combining both approaches yields better results, suggesting neural models fail to capture relaxation-based reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the assumption that neural CQA methods learn generalized patterns beyond explicit graph structure and can infer answers unreachable through symbolic query processing.

Method: Systematic comparison of neural CQA models with a training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths across multiple datasets and query structures.

Result: Neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly in many cases, with no neural model consistently outperforming relaxation. Their retrieved answers show little overlap, and combining their outputs consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Current neural CQA models fail to subsume reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation, highlighting the need for stronger non-neural baselines and suggesting future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating query relaxation principles.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

*Zhihong Shao,Yuxiang Luo,Chengda Lu,Z. Z. Ren,Jiewen Hu,Tian Ye,Zhibin Gou,Shirong Ma,Xiaokang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSeekMath-V2 advances mathematical reasoning by focusing on self-verifiable proof generation rather than just final answer accuracy, achieving near-perfect scores on major math competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches to mathematical reasoning have limitations: correct final answers don't guarantee correct reasoning, and many mathematical tasks (like theorem proving) require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers. There's a need for verifiable, comprehensive mathematical reasoning, especially for open problems without known solutions.

Method: 1) Train an accurate LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. 2) Use the verifier as a reward model to train a proof generator that identifies and resolves issues in its own proofs before finalizing them. 3) Scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs as the generator improves, creating training data to further improve the verifier.

Result: DeepSeekMath-V2 achieves gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024, and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that focusing on self-verifiable mathematical reasoning through a generation-verification loop with scaled verification compute can significantly advance theorem-proving capabilities beyond traditional final-answer-focused approaches.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

TL;DR: Comprehensive survey of AI deception - how AI systems learn to deceive for self-benefit, covering emergence mechanisms, detection methods, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deception has evolved from speculative concern to empirically demonstrated risk across language models and AI agents, posing significant safety challenges that require systematic understanding and mitigation.

Method: Provides formal definition grounded in signaling theory, organizes research as "deception cycle" with two components: deception emergence (analyzing incentive foundations, capability preconditions, contextual triggers) and deception treatment (detection methods, mitigation strategies, auditing approaches).

Result: Identifies that systems with sufficient capability and incentive inevitably engage in deception when triggered by external conditions; outlines comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing AI deception risks.

Conclusion: AI deception represents a critical sociotechnical safety challenge requiring integrated technical, community, and governance efforts; provides living resource (deceptionsurvey.com) to support ongoing research and mitigation.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

TL;DR: Multi-phase allocation method for agent scheduling in CCaaS that breaks problem into day and shift allocation subproblems to improve scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mathematical model-based solutions treat agent scheduling as single-step process, leading to inefficiencies and high computational demands, especially during peak scenarios like holiday rushes with limited employees.

Method: Multi-phase allocation method dividing problem into smaller sub-problems: day allocation and shift allocation. Each subproblem modeled as Integer Programming Problem (IPP) with solutions feeding sequentially into subsequent subproblem. Uses multi-objective framework.

Result: Significantly reduces computational variables, allows targeted objective functions, enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically addresses peak demand scenarios like holiday rushes where maintaining service levels is essential with limited employees.

Conclusion: Proposed multi-phase allocation method provides scalable and accurate solution for agent shift scheduling in CCaaS industry, overcoming limitations of traditional single-step approaches while effectively handling challenging peak demand scenarios.

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

TL;DR: GCA introduces a training-free agentic paradigm that bridges the semantic-to-geometric gap in VLMs by decoupling their role into semantic analyst and task solver stages with formal task constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning - they excel at semantic inference but operate in lossy semantic space misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current methods either suffer from oracle paradox (learning flawed logic from imperfect oracles) or leave VLM planning unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans.

Method: Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA) decouples VLM's role into two stages: 1) as semantic analyst, translates ambiguous queries into formal, verifiable task constraints defining reference frame and objective; 2) as task solver, generates and executes tool calls strictly within deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This creates geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy.

Result: GCA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by approximately 27%.

Conclusion: GCA successfully resolves the semantic-to-geometric gap in VLMs through a training-free agentic paradigm with formal task constraints, yielding robust and verifiable reasoning pathways for spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can now process arbitrarily long tool outputs without information loss by using memory pointers instead of raw data, reducing token usage by ~7x in materials science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to access specialized external tools in dynamic domains like Chemistry and Materials Science, but large tool outputs overflow context windows. Existing truncation/summarization methods lose critical information needed for complete workflows.

Method: Shifts LLM interaction from raw tool output data to memory pointers, allowing processing of arbitrarily long outputs without information loss while preserving full tool functionality and enabling seamless agentic workflow integration.

Result: Validated on real-world Materials Science application that conventional workflows cannot handle. Comparative analysis shows ~7x fewer tokens consumed than traditional workflow while maintaining full functionality.

Conclusion: The memory pointer approach enables LLMs to effectively utilize arbitrarily long tool outputs without information loss, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining complete workflow capabilities in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Conclusion: This agentic AI framework represents an advancement over traditional assistive systems by combining multi-agent reasoning, multimodal interfaces, and human-centered design to promote autonomy, health, and digital equity for people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

TL;DR: AI agent system integrates weather forecasting, hydrological modeling, and emergency response into a single closed-loop system for extreme rainfall events like cloudbursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting systems treat prediction and response as separate processes, which is inadequate for extreme short-duration rainfall events like cloudbursts that require integrated real-time decision-making.

Method: Agentic AI system with autonomous cooperative agents that combine sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling, and coordinated response into a closed-loop framework. Uses communication/routing agents and embedded learning layers for adaptive recalibration.

Result: Multi-year evaluation in northern Pakistan shows enhanced forecast reliability, critical success index, and warning lead time compared to baseline models. Maximized population reach, minimized evacuation errors, and provided transparent auditability.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents can transform atmospheric data into practical foresight and provide a scalable platform for adaptive, learning-based climate resilience.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FastDSA is a computationally efficient method for comparing dynamical systems that maintains the accuracy of previous dynamical similarity approaches while being at least 10x faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional similarity measures ignore dynamical processes in neural representations, and existing dynamical similarity methods are computationally slow, limiting their practical application for comparing neural circuits, brains, or models.

Method: FastDSA introduces two key innovations: (1) automatic selection of effective model order via data-driven singular-value thresholding to identify informative subspaces and discard noise, and (2) a novel optimization procedure with a lightweight process to maintain proximity to orthogonal transformations instead of enforcing exact orthogonality constraints.

Result: FastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy, robustness, invariances, and sensitivities to system dynamics.

Conclusion: FastDSA provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis, enabling practical comparison of neural systems while preserving the theoretical advantages of dynamical similarity frameworks.

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

Method: The authors thoroughly investigate InsightBench's shortcomings, establish essential criteria for high-quality insight benchmarks, develop a data-curation pipeline to construct InsightEval dataset, and introduce a novel metric to measure exploratory performance of agents.

Result: Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, the research highlights prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and provides key findings to guide future research in this direction.

Conclusion: The paper presents InsightEval as a superior benchmark for evaluating insight discovery capabilities, addressing critical flaws in existing frameworks and advancing the field of automated data analysis using LLMs and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

TL;DR: ORION models use Mentalese-style compressed reasoning tokens with SLPO optimization to achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, 5x lower latency, and 7-9x lower training costs while maintaining 90-98% accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models suffer from high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning due to long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens. Inspired by human cognitive efficiency through symbolic Mentalese, the authors aim to create more efficient reasoning models.

Method: Introduces Mentalese framework for compact symbolic reasoning tokens, plus SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO) - a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise correct solutions while allowing longer reasoning when needed.

Result: ORION models achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, up to 5x lower inference latency, 7-9x lower training costs vs DeepSeek R1 Distilled while maintaining 90-98% accuracy. Also surpass Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% accuracy with 2x compression on benchmarks like AIME 2024/2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC.

Conclusion: Mentalese-style compressed reasoning enables human-like cognitive efficiency for real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, representing a step toward more efficient AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

*Peng Kuang,Xiangxiang Wang,Wentao Liu,Jian Dong,Kaidi Xu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIM-PRM is a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from passive scoring to active, tool-augmented investigation to address visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies in multimodal math reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies in mathematical reasoning. Standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate these issues, and existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) suffer from sycophancy - they blindly validate flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality.

Method: TIM-PRM introduces an agentic framework that transforms verification into active, tool-augmented investigation. It trains models to explicitly plan verification strategies and uses Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. The method is instantiated by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

Result: The 8B parameter TIM-PRM model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs on VisualProcessBench, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

Conclusion: TIM-PRM successfully bridges the gap in current PRM approaches by transforming verification from passive classification to active investigation, effectively addressing sycophancy and confirmation bias through tool-augmented, context-decoupled verification strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

TL;DR: MindPower is a robot-centric framework that integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning for embodied agents, enabling better decision-making and action generation by modeling both self and others' mental states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language embodied agents lack Theory of Mind-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus only on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, which hinders coherent decision and action generation.

Method: Proposes MindPower, a robot-centric framework with four components: Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making, and Action. It also introduces Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages vision-language models to produce consistent ToM reasoning and behavior.

Result: The model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation, demonstrating significant improvements in ToM-based reasoning for embodied agents.

Conclusion: MindPower successfully addresses the limitations of current embodied agents by integrating comprehensive Theory of Mind reasoning that considers both self and others' perspectives, leading to more coherent decision-making and action generation.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

### [392] [Does Self-Evaluation Enable Wireheading in Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23092)
*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-evaluation coupled with reward signals leads to wireheading (grade inflation without accuracy gains), while decoupled self-evaluation remains safe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether self-evaluation creates wireheading incentives when coupled with reward signals, where models might manipulate rewards rather than improve task performance.

Method: Formalized conditions for reward-channel control dominance in POMDPs, then empirically tested across two models and three tasks comparing self-evaluation coupled vs. decoupled from rewards.

Result: Models whose self-grades determine rewards show substantial grade inflation without accuracy gains, especially on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Decoupled self-evaluation shows no inflation.

Conclusion: Self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design to avoid wireheading.

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

*Ruibing Wang,Shuhan Guo,Zeen Li,Zhen Wang,Quanming Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TPET uses LLMs as evolution engine to create specialized heuristic policies for traffic signal control, outperforming both classic heuristics and DRL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traffic signal control: classic heuristics are oversimplified, DRL lacks generalization and transparency, and online LLMs have high latency and lack environment-specific optimization.

Method: Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (TPET) uses LLMs as evolution engine with two key modules: Structured State Abstraction (SSA) converts traffic data to temporal-logical facts, and Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF) traces flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique.

Result: The framework yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors without requiring training.

Conclusion: TPET provides an effective approach to traffic signal control that combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with environment-specific optimization while avoiding the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

TL;DR: MARL algorithms (PPO & DQN) combined with P2P energy trading significantly reduce electricity costs, increase revenue, and lower peak demand in rural dairy farming communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based methods struggle in dynamic energy environments, while renewable integration in rural areas creates opportunities for decentralized P2P energy trading that requires adaptive optimization.

Method: Combined Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PPO and DQN) with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms, incorporating auction-based market clearing, price advisor agents, and load/battery management.

Result: DQN reduced electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%. PPO achieved 55.5% peak demand reduction in Ireland, with DQN reducing peak demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland.

Conclusion: The combination of MARL algorithms (DQN and PPO) with P2P energy trading creates efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management systems for rural communities with renewable integration.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Conclusion: AgriCoT provides a comprehensive and robust evaluation framework for assessing reasoning capabilities of VLMs in agricultural contexts, demonstrating that current models lack sufficient reasoning skills despite good question-answering performance, emphasizing the need for CoT-based evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

TL;DR: MCTR is a metacognitive framework that enables Vision-Language Models to adapt and improve during test time through hierarchical reasoning with memory systems, achieving strong performance on unseen Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with efficient adaptation to novel tasks at test time, unlike humans who use metacognitive models with memory for continuous strategy refinement. The paper aims to bridge this gap by equipping models with metacognitive self-updating capabilities.

Method: MCTR features a dual-structure metacognitive system: (1) meta-reasoning module that builds structured memory by discovering task rules, patterns, and relationships from test observations as natural language descriptions; (2) action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by retrieving knowledge from memory, updated via metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning.

Result: Evaluated on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen), MCTR achieves 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared to baselines, demonstrating robust test-time adaptation. Ablation studies and analyses show complementary contributions of both components and evolution toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: MCTR successfully bridges the adaptation gap between VLMs and human metacognition by enabling test-time learning through hierarchical memory systems, showing promising results for continuous improvement on novel tasks.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Motivation: Existing methods for audio-visual question answering fail to capture structural information within videos and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. The main challenge is identifying question-relevant cues from complex audio-visual content.

Method: 1) Introduces a novel multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models objects and their relationships as visually grounded, structured representations of audio-visual scenes. 2) Designs a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance expressive power in temporal integration, enabling fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within question-aware fused representations.

Conclusion: SHRIKE successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by introducing structured multi-modal scene graphs and KAN-based MoE for temporal integration, leading to superior audio-visual question answering performance through better structural understanding and fine-grained cross-modal interaction modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SuperIntelliAgent is an agentic learning framework that pairs a trainable diffusion model (learner) with a frozen LLM (verifier) for continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction and DPO training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous continual intelligence growth without human annotation, moving beyond conventional supervised fine-tuning by creating a self-supervised learning system that can improve continuously through interaction.

Method: Pairs a trainable small diffusion model (learner) with a frozen large language model (verifier). The learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, creating chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Uses dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory for reasoning traces and long-term memory for knowledge consolidation. Includes replay buffer for samples showing verifiable progress.

Result: With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit for growing intelligence, with paired feedback and partial-history replay yielding richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment for continual improvement.

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: WMAct enables LLM agents to internalize world models through efficient interaction and active reasoning, reducing redundant interactions and improving transferability to complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to world model reasoning impose rigid reasoning processes that constrain active learning and hinder efficient understanding of environmental dynamics through multi-turn interactions.

Method: WMAct liberates models from structured reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) reward rescaling that adjusts outcome rewards based on action efficacy to reduce redundancy, and (2) interaction frequency annealing that progressively reduces maximum allowed interaction turns to force internalization of environmental dynamics.

Result: Experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show WMAct enables effective world model reasoning that resolves tasks in single turns (previously requiring multiple interactions) and demonstrates strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: WMAct achieves efficient world model internalization by allowing models to shape thinking through doing, reducing over-reliance on environmental cues while maintaining effective reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully estimates sea state and vessel parameters without requiring prior knowledge of wave-vessel transfer functions, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods that rely on this information.

Abstract: Real-time sea state estimation is vital for applications like shipbuilding and maritime safety. Traditional methods rely on accurate wave-vessel transfer functions to estimate wave spectra from onboard sensors. In contrast, our approach jointly estimates sea state and vessel parameters without needing prior transfer function knowledge, which may be unavailable or variable. We model the wave-vessel system using pseudo mass-spring-dampers and develop a dynamic model for the system. This method allows for recursive modeling of wave excitation as a time-varying input, relaxing prior works' assumption of a constant input. We derive statistically consistent process noise covariance and implement a square root cubature Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Further, we derive the Posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound to evaluate estimator performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and data from a high-fidelity validated simulator confirm that the estimated wave spectrum matches methods assuming complete transfer function knowledge.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PowerSense: Real-time passive tracking framework using only CSI power (not phase) for ISAC applications, achieving 0.4m median tracking error without calibration while extracting micro-Doppler signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object tracking in ISAC faces challenges from limited bandwidth, sparse antenna arrays, and clock asynchronism in bistatic deployments. CSI phase, while informative, suffers from time-varying distortions requiring complex processing that introduces interference.

Method: 1) Remove CSI phase offsets via self-conjugate operation to get phase-independent CSI power. 2) Apply cascaded FFT to extract delay, AoA, and Doppler features. 3) Perform object detection and outlier removal. 4) Use Extended Kalman Filter for continuous trajectory estimation. 5) Extract refined micro-Doppler signatures from estimated positions.

Result: Indoor experiments using 3.1 GHz LTE and 5 GHz WiFi bistatic signals with 20 MHz bandwidth achieved median tracking error of 0.4 meters without any pre-deployment system calibration, while simultaneously extracting clear and unambiguous micro-Doppler signatures.

Conclusion: PowerSense demonstrates that CSI power alone is sufficient for accurate object tracking in ISAC applications, avoiding the complexities of phase processing while achieving sub-meter accuracy and enabling fine-grained motion sensing through micro-Doppler extraction.

Abstract: Accurate object tracking in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications remains challenging due to limited signal bandwidth, sparse antenna arrays, and clock asynchronism inherent in bistatic transceiver deployments. This paper proposes PowerSense, a real-time passive tracking framework that operates directly on the power of Channel State Information (CSI). Although CSI phase carries fine-grained information, its time-varying distortions require complex processing, which introduces additional interference during tracking. Instead, this work solely relies on CSI power for accurate sensing. We first remove all CSI phase offsets through a self-conjugate operation, yielding phase-independent CSI power. A cascaded Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then applied to extract delay, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and Doppler features, followed by object detection, outlier removal, and continuous trajectory estimation via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To enable fine-grained motion sensing, the estimated target positions are further used to extract refined micro-Doppler signatures. Using 3.1 GHz LTE and 5 GHz WiFi bistatic signals with a 20 MHz bandwidth, our indoor experiments achieve a median tracking error of 0.4 m, without performing any pre-deployment system calibration, while simultaneously extracting clear and unambiguous micro-Doppler signatures of the tracked target.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern radar systems face significant challenges in target detection and parameter estimation when dealing with mainlobe jamming, requiring effective methods to handle structured jamming interference.

Method: Combines diffusion modeling for jamming (score-based diffusion process learned from pure jamming data) with sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for target signals. Uses EM algorithm for hyperparameter updates and noise variance estimation, with single diffusion process for jamming and direct posterior inference for targets.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness in structured jamming scenarios, achieving superior target detection performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DMDD approach effectively addresses mainlobe jamming challenges by combining diffusion-based jamming modeling with SBL-based target estimation, offering computational efficiency and improved detection performance.

Abstract: In modern radar systems, target detection and parameter estimation face significant challenges when confronted with mainlobe jamming. This paper presents a Diffusion-based Model and Data Dual-driven (DMDD) approach to estimate and detect multitargets and suppress structured jamming. In DMDD, the jamming prior is modeled through a score-based diffusion process with its score learned from the pure jamming data, enabling posterior sampling without requiring detailed knowledge of jamming. Meanwhile, the target signal is usually sparse in the range space, which can be modeled via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, and hyperparameter is updated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A single diffusion process is constructed for the jamming, while the state of targets are estimated through direct posterior inference, enhancing computational efficiency. The noise variance is also estimated through EM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in structured jamming scenarios. The proposed DMDD algorithm achieves superior target detection performance, compared with existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper investigates rate-energy trade-offs in pinching-antenna systems for SWIPT, proposing optimization algorithms for single and multiple user scenarios with different multiple access schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the rate-energy trade-off in pinching-antenna systems for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, addressing both single and multiple user scenarios to improve performance over conventional fixed-position antenna systems.

Method: For single IU/EU: two-stage algorithm using SCA for path loss minimization followed by phase alignment fine-tuning. For multiple IUs/EUs: three multiple access schemes (FDMA, TDMA, NOMA) with MOOP formulation converted to SOOPs using ε-constraint method, then solved with PSO for beamforming and convex optimization for resource allocation.

Result: Simulation results show: 1) PASS achieves significantly superior rate-energy region compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems, and 2) TDMA outperforms both NOMA and FDMA for multiple user scenarios by exploiting time-switching features.

Conclusion: PASS-assisted SWIPT systems with optimized pinching beamforming and appropriate multiple access schemes (particularly TDMA) can achieve superior rate-energy trade-offs and user fairness compared to conventional systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the rate-energy trade-off for pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. Both the single information user (IU)/energy user (EU) and multiple IUs/EUs scenarios are considered.1) For the single IU/EU scenario, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated for simultaneously maximizing data rate and harvested energy. To tackle this problem, a two-stage algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is first invoked for minimizing the large-scale path loss, which is followed by the fine-tuning method for the phase alignment. 2) For the multiple IUs/EUs scenario, three multiple access schemes are considered, i.e., frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The corresponding multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested energy is formulated for ensuring users' fairness. To address this problem, we adopt the $ε$-constraint method to first convert the intractable MOOPs to single-objective optimization problems (SOOPs). Then, for the SOOP under each multiple access protocol, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and convex optimization methods are adopted for solving the pinching beamforming and resource allocation problems, respectively. Simulation results unveil that: i) PASS can achieve a significantly superior rate-energy region compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems for pinching beamforming; and ii) by exploiting the time-switching feature, TDMA can outperform both NOMA and FDMA for the multiple IUs/EUs scenario.

Conclusion: The CNN-based optimization framework enables efficient, scalable, and adaptable PA-NOMA systems with near-optimal performance for unseen network configurations without retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a flexible-antenna architecture, referred to as a pinching-antenna (PA) system, in which multiple PAs realized by activating small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide are jointly employed to serve a single-antenna user. We investigate antenna placement and power allocation optimization in PA-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a convolutional neural network (CNN). An optimization strategy is developed to determine the PA locations that maximize achievable NOMA performance while satisfying physical and spatial constraints. The proposed method adopts a two-stage structure, combining a user-aware initialization with a gradient-based refinement, enabling near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational cost. A max-min fairness formulation is introduced for power allocation to balance the power budget among users with varying channel strengths, solved efficiently via quasi-linear programming and bisection search. Finally, a CNN-based learning framework is employed to capture the nonlinear mapping between channel conditions and the corresponding optimal power coefficients. This framework can infer near-optimal power allocations for unseen network configurations without retraining, offering scalability and adaptability. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN-based NOMA approach for PA systems improves sum rate and user fairness while reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: The bio-inspired whisker sensor provides a robust, scalable solution for practical underwater flow sensing on UUV platforms, addressing key limitations of existing technologies.

Abstract: Underwater flow sensing is critical for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and environmental monitoring, yet existing sensors often suffer from low responsiveness, high detection thresholds, limited directional discrimination, complex packaging, and poor long-term stability, especially for navigation and target perception in turbid and cluttered waters. Previous solutions based on traditional strain gauges with limited detection accuracy or doped silicon sensors with limited detection height have shown feasibility but still face challenges in scalability, robustness under harsh aquatic conditions, and calibration complexity. This work presents a bio-inspired whisker sensor that provides a balanced solution by embedding high-gauge-factor silicon strain gauges into a flexible PDMS base, mimicking seal whiskers to offer both high sensitivity and simplified packaging. The device exhibits a linear force-resistance response with a limit of detection of 0.27 mN, maintains stability after 10,000 loading cycles, and shows minimal offset drift of less than 2 percent. It also demonstrates frequency matching in underwater dipole tests with clear longitudinal and transverse spatial response patterns. These results indicate a robust and scalable route for underwater flow sensing on UUV platforms in practical deployments.

*Ali Al Khansa,Youssef Bahannis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes dual-window periodogram algorithm for OFDM ISAC systems that adaptively balances sidelobe attenuation and resolution using complementary windows with decision mechanism to trigger high-performance detection only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OFDM ISAC systems use fixed single windows with predefined detection strategies (BSTC for low complexity or CSTC for high performance), which cannot adaptively balance sidelobe attenuation and resolution trade-offs for multi-target detection scenarios.

Method: Uses two complementary windows: one optimized for resolution, another for sidelobe suppression. Applies low-complexity detection (BSTC) to both, compares outputs, and triggers high-performance algorithm (CSTC) only when results disagree to resolve ambiguities.

Result: Achieves high performance while reducing complexity, especially at high SNR. Numerical results confirm effectiveness of adaptive approach in balancing detection performance and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-window adaptive algorithm successfully addresses limitations of fixed strategies by dynamically balancing performance and complexity in OFDM ISAC multi-target detection systems.

Abstract: In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, a key challenge is balancing sidelobe attenuation and resolution for multi-target detection scenarios. While windowing functions are typically used to manage this trade-off, state-of-the-art methods rely on a single, fixed window followed by a predefined detection strategy (e.g., Binary Successive Target Cancellation (BSTC) (low complexity) or Coherent Successive Target Cancellation (CSTC) (high performance)). This paper proposes a novel dual-window periodogram-based algorithm that leverages two complementary windows: one optimized for resolution and the other for sidelobe suppression. Then, a low-complexity detection algorithm (e.g., BSTC) is applied to both, and a decision mechanism compares the outputs. When results align, the resolution-optimized estimates are directly used; otherwise, high performance algorithm (e.g., CSTC) is triggered to resolve ambiguities. This adaptive approach dynamically balances the detection performance and the complexity, addressing limitations in existing fixed strategies. The Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves high performance while reducing the complexity, especially at a high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

*Ali Al Khansa*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A CNN-based method for ISAC with OFDM that fuses two complementary windowed range-Doppler periodograms - one optimized for resolution and one for sidelobe suppression - to improve target detection accuracy in dense scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN methods for estimating target count from 2D range-Doppler periodograms suffer accuracy degradation in dense scenes due to the classical resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off, and existing windowing approaches use static choices that don't adapt to different scenarios.

Method: Proposes a CNN architecture that takes two windowed range-Doppler periodograms as input: one window optimized for resolution and another optimized for sidelobe suppression. The model learns to fuse these complementary views to determine when each is most informative for target detection.

Result: Numerical experiments show consistent performance gains over single-window CNN baselines, with better scaling in target density and greater robustness across different noise levels.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-window CNN fusion approach effectively addresses the resolution-sidelobe trade-off in ISAC systems, providing improved target detection performance in challenging dense scenarios.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. Recent studies show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can estimate the number of targets from two-dimensional (2D) range-Doppler periodogram maps, yet accuracy often degrades as scenes become denser. One significant factor is the classical resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off, which limits performance when targets are weak or closely spaced. While windowing is routinely applied to shape this trade-off, the choice is typically static. This paper proposes a new CNN method that uses two windowed range-Doppler periodograms and learns to fuse complementary views: one window optimized for resolution and one window optimized for sidelobe suppression. The design explicitly targets the resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off by exposing the model to complementary windowed maps and letting it learn when each is most informative. Numerical experiments show consistent gains over single-window CNN baselines, with better scaling in target density and greater robustness across different noise levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites need fast beam steering for ground devices but face power/size/weight constraints with large antenna arrays. Future non-terrestrial networks require high spectral efficiency, motivating in-band full-duplex systems.

Method: Proposes FD LEO satellite system with NR-BD-RIS and multiple transmit/receive antennas. NR-BD-RIS breaks channel reciprocity via non-reciprocal components in impedance network, enabling simultaneous multi-beam support. Uses time-sharing scheduling framework to serve multiple DL/UL devices per time slot.

Result: NR-BD-RIS significantly outperforms conventional BD-RIS and diagonal RIS in DL/UL sum-rate for both single-user and multi-user cases. Requires less frequent reconfiguration than other RIS types, making it more practical.

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS is an effective solution for FD LEO satellite systems, providing superior performance with reduced reconfiguration needs compared to existing RIS approaches.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite is a promising technology for providing low-latency, high-data-rate, and wide-coverage communication services. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites necessitates fast and accurate beam steering to continuously serve ground devices. While large antenna arrays can address these challenges, strict constraints on power, size, and weight make such solutions difficult to implement. Furthermore, future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) require high spectral efficiency, which motivates the adoption of in-band full-duplex (FD) systems. {To overcome these challenges, we propose an FD LEO satellite system, where the non-reciprocal beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (NR-BD-RIS) and multiple transmit and receive antennas are attached to the LEO satellite. The NR-BD-RIS reflects the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) signals by passive beamforming.} By incorporating non-reciprocal components into the impedance network of RIS, the NR-BD-RIS breaks channel reciprocity, facilitating simultaneous support for multiple beam directions. To cover a wide coverage, we propose a time-sharing scheduling framework where, in each time slot, the NR-BD-RIS simultaneously serves multiple DL and multiple UL ground devices. An optimization problem is defined to maximize the weighted sum-rate over the entire scheduling period. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NR-BD-RIS significantly performs better than both conventional BD-RIS and diagonal RIS (D-RIS) regarding DL and UL sum-rate performance under both single-user (SU) and multiple-user (MU) cases. Additionally, the NR-BD-RIS requires less frequent reconfiguration compared to other two types of RIS, making it more practical for implementation.

Result: Model-based solutions effectively fulfill EMF constraints with good performance; data-driven approaches approximate model-based performance with much lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: Both model-based and data-driven power control approaches successfully address EMF constraints in CF-mMIMO systems, with data-driven methods offering computational efficiency advantages.

Abstract: The impressive growth of wireless data networks has recently led to increased attention to the issue of electromagnetic pollution and the fulfillment of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure limits. This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper develops a theory for optimal moduli selection in Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (RCRT) with bounded errors, providing exact solutions for small L (2-4) and introducing layered constructions for predictable trade-offs between error tolerance and dynamic range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fundamental problem of moduli selection in RCRT with perturbed residues needs systematic solutions. Prior work focused on algorithms, but lacks a comprehensive theory for designing moduli that maximize robustness under practical constraints.

Method: For small L (2-4), exact solutions maximize robustness margin under dynamic-range and modulus-bound constraints. Introduces Fibonacci-inspired layered construction for L=2 producing exactly K robust decoding layers. Analyzes robustness-range trade-offs across layers and provides closed-form success probability estimation.

Result: Exact optimal solutions for L=2,3,4 moduli. Layered construction enables predictable trade-offs between error tolerance and dynamic range. Framework establishes general theory of moduli design for RCRT, complementing prior algorithmic work.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a comprehensive theory for robust moduli design in RCRT, with promising applications in sub-Nyquist sampling, phase unwrapping, range estimation, modulo ADCs, and RNS-based deep learning accelerators.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of \emph{moduli selection} in the Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (RCRT), where each residue may be perturbed by a bounded error. Consider $L$ moduli of the form $m_i = Γ_i m$ ($1 \le i \le L$), where $Γ_i$ are pairwise coprime integers and $m \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a common scaling factor. For small $L$ ($L = 2, 3, 4$), we obtain exact solutions that maximize the robustness margin under dynamic-range and modulus-bound constraints. We also introduce a Fibonacci-inspired \emph{layered} construction (for $L = 2$) that produces exactly $K$ robust decoding layers, enabling predictable trade-offs between error tolerance and dynamic range. We further analyze how robustness and range evolve across layers and provide a closed-form expression to estimate the success probability under common data and noise models. The results are promising for various applications, such as sub-Nyquist sampling, phase unwrapping, range estimation, modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and robust residue-number-system (RNS)-based accelerators for deep learning. Our framework thus establishes a general theory of moduli design for RCRT, complementing prior algorithmic work and underscoring the broad relevance of robust moduli design across diverse information-processing domains.

TL;DR: EIW introduces embodied intelligence to wireless networks, transforming communication nodes into active, environment-aware entities that continuously perceive, adapt, and interact with dynamic wireless environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-native wireless designs use static, modular AI substitutions that fail to meet future network requirements for continuous perception, adaptation, and interaction with dynamic wireless environments.

Method: Proposes Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW) built around an observation-decision-action paradigm: multi-dimensional observations, unified decision module for orchestrating wireless agents, and actions affecting environment and systems. Includes enabling technologies like wireless world models and self-update/evolution mechanisms.

Result: Simulations demonstrate advantages of EIW paradigm and enabling techniques in shaping wireless communication node design, showing improved training efficiency, counterfactual evaluation, and better adaptation.

Conclusion: EIW redefines future communication systems as intelligent entities that continuously interact with and co-evolve with their environments, moving beyond passive data pipelines to active, environment-aware entities.

Abstract: The evolution toward the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond mobile communication systems is marked by a fundamental shift from merely connecting devices to enabling pervasive and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication designs have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing paradigm remains limited to static, modular AI substitutions. This approach fails to meet the core requirements of future wireless networks: the ability to continuously perceive, adapt to, and interact with the dynamic wireless environment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW), a novel communication paradigm inspired by embodied intelligence, which redefines the communication node as an active, environment-aware, and evolving entity. EIW is built around an observation-decision-action paradigm, comprising: multi-dimensional observations for comprehensive awareness of the environment and system states, a unified decision module for orchestrating multiple wireless agents in an interpretable manner, and actions where wireless agents exert practical effects on both the environment and communication systems. Furthermore, two enabling technologies, wireless world models as well as self-update and self-evolution mechanisms, are introduced to support training efficiency improvement, counterfactual evaluation, and better adaptation. Unlike existing communication systems, EIW envisions future communication systems not as passive data pipelines, but as intelligent entities that continuously interact with and co-evolve alongside their environments. Finally, through simulations, we showcase the advantages of the proposed EIW paradigm and its enabling techniques in shaping the design of wireless communication nodes.

Motivation: To enhance physical layer security in wireless networks by leveraging RIS capabilities to simultaneously improve legitimate communication while degrading eavesdropper's channel through strategic AN deployment.

Method: Partition RIS into two segments: one directs communication signal to Bob, other steers AN toward Eve. Develop iterative and DFT-based algorithms for RIS phase shift optimization, and optimize power allocation between CS and AN to maximize secrecy capacity while limiting Eve's capacity.

Result: Simulations and SDR-based testbed experiments demonstrate promising improvements in secrecy capacity, showing practical viability of AN-driven RIS-assisted PLS.

Conclusion: AN-driven RIS-assisted physical layer security framework shows significant potential for practical deployments in next-generation wireless networks by effectively enhancing secrecy capacity through intelligent RIS partitioning and optimization.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a key enabler for providing signal coverage, energy efficiency, reliable communication, and physical layer security (PLS) in next-generation wireless communication networks. This paper investigates an artificial noise (AN)-driven RIS-assisted secure communication system. The RIS is partitioned into two segments, where the first segment is configured to direct the communication signal (CS) toward the legitimate user (Bob), and the other one is configured to steer the AN toward the eavesdropper (Eve). To this end, iterative and discrete Fourier transform-based algorithms are developed for practical RIS phase shift optimization. The power allocation between the CS and the AN signals is optimized in such a way that the secrecy capacity (SC) is maximized while limiting Eve's channel capacity. The proposed PLS framework is evaluated through both simulations and software defined radio based testbed experiments. The results demonstrate promising improvements in the SC, highlighting the potential of AN-driven RIS-assisted PLS for practical deployments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered Large Language Model (ReLLM) framework for dynamic radio resource management in O-RAN-inspired 6G networks, using dual agents for SLA violation detection and resource reallocation to improve efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI advancements have significant implications for wireless communications, particularly in resource management. The paper addresses the need for intelligent, adaptive control of network slices in 6G networks while minimizing computational overhead and energy consumption from frequent LLM inference calls.

Method: Proposes a ReLLM-driven framework with two specialized agents: one monitors and estimates slice-specific performance metrics to proactively detect SLA violations, and another dynamically reallocates physical resource blocks when violation probability exceeds thresholds. The dual-agent design aims to minimize unnecessary LLM inference calls while ensuring SLA compliance.

Result: Implemented and validated on an end-to-end O-RAN testbed using OpenAirInterface emulators. The ReLLM approach maintains near-zero drop ratio for low-priority slices while satisfying acceptable latency for high-priority slices, with reduced token consumption. Demonstrates improved reliability and SLA compliance.

Conclusion: The ReLLM-driven framework proves practical for real-world O-RAN testbeds and shows potential applicability to future 6G networks, offering computational and energy efficiency improvements while ensuring reliable SLA compliance through intelligent resource management.

Abstract: Implications of the advancements in the area of artificial intelligence to the wireless communications is extremely significant, especially in terms of resource management. In this paper, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered Large Language Model (ReLLM)-driven dynamic radio resource management framework for Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) inspired 6G networks is proposed. The introduced methodology leverages the ReLLM framework to interpret both historical and real-time network data, enabling adaptive control of network slices. The ReLLM is founded on two specialized agents, one is responsible for proactively detecting service level agreement (SLA) violations by continuously monitoring and estimating slice-specific performance metrics, and the other one is responsible for dynamically reallocating physical resource blocks when the SLA violation probability exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The primary objective of this dual-agent design is to minimize unnecessary LLM inference calls while satisfying the SLA requirements of the slices, thereby improving computational and energy efficiency. The proposed ReLLM framework is implemented and validated on an end-to-end O-RAN testbed built upon open-source OpenAirInterface emulators. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM approach with its reduced token consumption feature maintains a near-zero drop ratio for the low-priority slice while simultaneously satisfying acceptable latency performance for the high-priority slice. The ReLLM-driven design improves reliability and SLA compliance, confirming its practicality for real-world O-RAN testbeds and its potential applicability to future 6G networks.

TL;DR: Sparse arrays with directional antenna elements (patch/Vivaldi) significantly improve DoA estimation accuracy and coverage distance compared to uniform omnidirectional arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effects of directional antenna element complex gain patterns and nonidealities on DoA estimation performance, comparing sparse arrays vs. uniform linear arrays.

Method: Used EM simulation tools to accurately model electromagnetic behavior of patch and Vivaldi antenna elements including mutual coupling effects, compared sparse arrays with classical uniform linear arrays for DoA estimation using MUSIC algorithm.

Result: Sparse arrays with directional elements achieved over 90% reduction in average direction finding error compared to uniform omnidirectional arrays with same number of elements. For fixed angular RMSE, array sensitivity improvements yielded 4-15x increase in one-way coverage distance. Best performance with sparse arrays using patch elements for 100° FoV or Vivaldi elements for 120° FoV.

Conclusion: Directional antenna elements combined with sparse array configurations significantly enhance DoA estimation accuracy and operational range, with specific element types optimized for different field of view requirements.

Abstract: This paper studies the effects of directional antenna element complex gain patterns and nonidealities in direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. We compare sparse arrays and classical uniform linear arrays, harnessing EM simulation tools to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of both patch and Vivaldi antenna element including mutual coupling effects. We show that with sparse array configurations, the performance impacts are significant in terms of DoA estimation accuracy and operable SNR ranges. Specifically, in the scenarios considered, both the usage of directional antenna elements and a sparse array result in over 90% reduction in average direction finding error, compared to a uniform omnidirectional array with the same number of elements (in this case eight), when estimating the directions of two sources using the MUSIC algorithm. For a fixed angular RMSE, the improvements in array sensitivity are shown to yield a 4 to 15-fold increase in one-way coverage distance (assuming free-space path loss). Among the studied options, the best performance was obtained using sparse arrays with either patch or Vivaldi elements for field of views of 100$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, respectively.

TL;DR: Chaotic signals outperform conventional schemes for wireless power transfer and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in 6G networks, with proposed DCSK-based architectures for enhanced energy harvesting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chaotic signals offer inherent randomness and sensitivity to initial conditions, making them ideal for secure communications and effective for wireless power transfer. With 6G networks requiring self-sustainability and massive device connectivity, SWIPT becomes crucial, and chaotic signals have shown experimentally better WPT performance than existing schemes.

Method: Characterize generalized WPT performance of multi-dimensional chaotic signals using Lorenz and Henon systems. Propose novel DCSK-based WPT receiver architecture for enhanced energy harvesting. Develop DCSK-based transmit waveform designs for multi-antenna SWIPT architectures and investigate rate-energy trade-off.

Result: Chaotic signals demonstrate superior WPT performance compared to benchmark schemes. The proposed DCSK-based architectures enable enhanced energy harvesting capabilities and optimized SWIPT performance through careful rate-energy trade-off analysis.

Conclusion: Chaotic signals are highly relevant for both WPT and SWIPT in 6G networks, offering improved power transfer efficiency and enabling self-sustainable wireless networks through their unique properties and proposed DCSK-based architectures.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems have attracted considerable attention due to their inherent randomness and high sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes them ideal for secure wireless communications. Beyond security, these same characteristics also make chaotic signals particularly effective for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications. On the other hand, connectivity along with self-sustainability are the two cornerstones of the upcoming sixth generation (6G) standard for radio communications. Consequently, with the massive increase in wireless devices and sensors, the concept of self-sustainable wireless networks is becoming more relevant. The aspect of WPT to the widely spread wireless devices and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) among these devices will play a crucial role in the 6G communication systems. In this context, it has been experimentally observed that chaotic signals result in better WPT performance as compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Hence, in this paper, we characterize the generalized WPT performance of the multi-dimensional chaotic signals and present the use case of the Lorenz and the Henon chaotic systems. Moreover, we provide a novel differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based WPT receiver architecture ideal for enhanced energy harvesting (EH). Furthermore, we propose DCSK-based transmit waveform designs for multi-antenna SWIPT architectures and investigate the impact of the rate-energy trade-off. Our goal is to explore these aspects of the chaotic signals and discuss their relevance in the context of both WPT and SWIPT.

*Mikayil Mahmudlu,Oktay Karakuş,Hasan Arkadaş*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A hierarchical Bayesian framework integrates expert knowledge to quantify player-specific finishing effects in xG models, addressing limitations of standard approaches that treat all players as identical finishers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard expected goals (xG) models treat all players as identical finishers, ignoring individual skill differences. This limitation prevents accurate player evaluation and tactical planning that accounts for player-specific finishing abilities.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors from Football Manager 2017 ratings, using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data. The framework stabilizes player-level estimates through shrinkage, especially for players with few shots.

Result: The model reduces posterior uncertainty, achieves strong external validity (R²=0.75 vs baseline, R²=0.833 vs StatsBomb xG), identifies interpretable specialization profiles (one-on-one finishing, long-range shooting, first-touch execution), and enables counterfactual shot reallocation analysis revealing asymmetrical player substitutions.

Conclusion: Provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning that accounts for individual finishing skills, with general applicability to domains where individual ability and contextual factors jointly shape performance.

Abstract: This study develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates expert domain knowledge to quantify player-specific effects in expected goals (xG) estimation, addressing a limitation of standard models that treat all players as identical finishers. Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual "what-if" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG). This work provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning, and offers a general approach for domains where individual skill and contextual factors jointly shape performance.

TL;DR: AN-aided beamforming framework for pinching-antenna systems that jointly optimizes information beams, AN covariance, and PA positions to maximize secrecy rate under both perfect and imperfect CSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MIMO systems suffer from severe path loss and vulnerability to nearby eavesdroppers due to fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems offer a promising alternative with reconfigurable antennas along low-loss waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats.

Method: Proposed AN-aided beamforming framework for PAS downlink that maximizes secrecy rate by jointly optimizing information beams, AN covariance, and PA positions.

Derived closed-form solution for single-waveguide scenario, and developed DNN-aided joint optimizer for multiple waveguides and users.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves secrecy rate consistently over PAS baselines in single- and multi-user settings under both perfect and imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: The proposed AN-aided beamforming framework effectively enhances security in pinching-antenna systems by jointly optimizing beamforming, artificial noise, and antenna placement, providing robust performance under both perfect and imperfect channel state information conditions.

Abstract: As next-generation wireless networks emerge, security is becoming a critical performance metric. However, conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems often suffer from severe path loss and are vulnerable to nearby eavesdroppers due to their fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging reconfigurable pinching antennas (PAs) positioned along low-loss dielectric waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided beamforming framework for the PAS downlink that maximizes the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly optimizing the information beams, the AN covariance, and the PA positions. We examine both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper's channel. For the latter, location errors are mapped via a Jacobian into an ellipsoidal channel uncertainty set to accurately formulate the problem. We derive a closed-form solution for the single-waveguide scenario, yielding the optimal PA location and an information/AN power-splitting rule. For multiple waveguides and users, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)-aided joint optimizer that outputs beams, AN, and PA placements. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves SR consistently over PAS baselines in single- and multi-user settings under both perfect and imperfect CSI.

*Yao Peng,Tingting Liu,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning approach using graph neural networks to jointly optimize pilot length, pilot assignment, and power allocation in user-centric cell-free multi-antenna systems to maximize net spectral efficiency while mitigating pilot contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pilot contamination severely degrades spectral efficiency in user-centric cell-free multi-antenna systems. Existing works that jointly optimize pilot assignment and power allocation with fixed pilot length fail to balance pilot overhead against contamination, limiting net-SE performance.

Method: The authors design size-generalizable graph neural networks (GNNs) to handle variable pilot length optimization. They introduce feature enhancement to address the one-to-many mapping challenge of pilot assignment, develop a contamination-aware attention mechanism, and create both dual-timescale (for large- and small-scale channel dependencies) and single-timescale (for faster inference) GNN frameworks.

Result: Simulation results show the designed GNNs outperform existing methods in net-SE, training complexity, and inference time, while demonstrating good generalization across problem scales and channel conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach with size-generalizable GNNs effectively addresses the joint optimization of pilot length, assignment, and power allocation, achieving superior net-SE performance with practical training and inference efficiency in user-centric cell-free systems.

Abstract: In user-centric cell-free multi-antenna systems, pilot contamination degrades spectral efficiency (SE) severely. To mitigate pilot contamination, existing works jointly optimize pilot assignment and power allocation by assuming fixed pilot length, which fail to balance pilot overhead against the contamination. To maximize net-SE, we jointly optimize pilot length, pilot assignment, and power allocation with deep learning. Since the pilot length is a variable, the size of pilot assignment matrix is unknown during the optimization. To cope with the challenge, we design size-generalizable graph neural networks (GNNs). We prove that pilot assignment policy is a one-to-many mapping, and improperly designed GNNs cannot learn the optimal policy. We tackle this issue by introducing feature enhancement. To improve learning performance, we design a contamination-aware attention mechanism for the GNNs. Given that pilot assignment and power allocation respectively depend on large- and small-scale channels, we develop a dual-timescale GNN framework to explore the potential. To reduce inference time, a single-timescale GNN is also designed. Simulation results show that the designed GNNs outperform existing methods in terms of net-SE, training complexity, and inference time, and can be well generalized across problem scales and channels.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Comparison of data-driven vs model-based metabolite quantification in MRS shows supervised learning works well within training distribution but degrades with OoD effects, while test-time adaptation provides better resilience to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the resilience of data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy against out-of-distribution effects, balancing accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.

Method: Trained neural network for MRS quantification using three strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation, compared against model-based fitting tools. Used large-scale simulated data and 7T in-vivo human brain spectra.

Result: Supervised learning achieved high accuracy within training distribution but degraded with extrapolation. Test-time adaptation proved most resilient to OoD effects. Self-supervised learning showed intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments revealed larger variance due to domain shift.

Conclusion: Data-driven methods can achieve strong MRS metabolite quantification, but reliability depends on training distribution considerations and OoD effects. When target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation ensures consistency between quantification, data, and model for reliable pipelines.

Abstract: This study systematically compared data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on resilience to out-of-distribution (OoD) effects and the balance between accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines.

Conclusion: Time series foundation models demonstrate strong generalization and data efficiency in fault diagnosis, providing a scalable and adaptive framework for intelligent motor condition monitoring with minimal labeled data requirements.

Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1\% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22\%, reaching 90\% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.

*Feng Xi,Dehui Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes gridless super-resolution framework for near-field XL-MIMO channel estimation without codebooks, using atomic norm minimization and DCR subspace structure for sublinear pilot scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing near-field channel estimation methods require large polar-domain codebooks due to joint angle-range discretization, leading to high complexity and basis mismatch issues.

Method: Uses second-order approximation to represent near-field channel as superposition of complex exponentials with unknown waveforms in DCR subspace, applies lifting technique and regularized atomic norm minimization (convex SDP), then refines with gradient-based nonlinear least squares.

Result: Achieves accurate joint angle-range estimation with sublinear pilot scaling relative to array size, avoids basis mismatch and exhaustive 2D grid searches, enables accurate channel reconstruction and user localization.

Conclusion: Proposed gridless super-resolution framework provides efficient near-field channel estimation for XL-MIMO without codebooks, overcoming limitations of existing discretization-based approaches.

Abstract: Existing near-field channel estimation methods for extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) typically discretize angle and range parameters jointly, resulting in large polar-domain codebooks. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates near-field channel estimation as a gridless super-resolution problem, eliminating the need for explicitly constructed codebooks. By employing a second-order approximation of spherical-wave steering vectors, the near-field channel is represented as a superposition of complex exponentials modulated by unknown waveforms. We demonstrate that these waveforms lie tightly in a common discrete chirp rate (DCR) subspace, with a dimension that scales as $Θ(\sqrt{N})$ for an $N$-element array. By leveraging this structure and applying a lifting technique, we reformulate the non-convex problem as a convex program using regularized atomic norm minimization, which admits an equivalent semidefinite program. From the solution to the convex program, we obtain gridless angle estimates and derive closed-form coarse range estimates, followed by refinement under the exact spherical model using gradient-based nonlinear least squares. The proposed method avoids basis mismatch and exhaustive two-dimensional grid searches while enabling accurate joint angle-range estimation with pilot budgets that scale sublinearly with array size in sparse multipath regimes. Simulations demonstrate accurate channel reconstruction and user localization across representative near-field scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) models that can simultaneously evaluate both communication and sensing performance in bistatic systems, addressing limitations of existing channel models that don't properly handle target interactions.

Method: Dual-component model decomposing ISAC channel into target channel (multipath from sensing target) and background channel (other propagation paths). Extends TR38.901 via hybrid clustering approach integrating deterministic clusters with stochastic clusters to preserve channel reciprocity and delay alignment for sensing parameter estimation.

Result: Extensive simulations across urban macro, urban micro, and indoor factory scenarios show the model maintains communication performance parity with standard TR38.901 (validated via bit-error rate analysis and channel capacity), while enabling sensing performance evaluation including target ranging error for localization and ROC curves for detection probability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides a comprehensive geometry-based statistical model for bistatic ISAC systems that balances both communication and sensing performance requirements, validated across multiple realistic deployment scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for a geometry-based statistical model for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tailored for bistatic systems. Our dual-component model decomposes the ISAC channel into a target channel encompassing all multipath components produced by a sensing target parameterized by the target's radar cross-section and scattering points, and a background channel comprising all other propagation paths that do not interact with the sensing target. The framework extends TR38.901 via a hybrid clustering approach, integrating spatiotemporally consistent deterministic clusters with stochastic clusters to preserve channel reciprocity and absolute delay alignment for sensing parameter estimation. Extensive simulations across urban macro, urban micro, and indoor factory scenarios demonstrate that the model maintains communication performance parity with the standard TR38.901, validated through bit-error rate analysis obtained via simulated and measured ISAC channels and channel capacity assessment, while enabling sensing performance evaluation, such as target ranging error for localization and receiver operating characteristic curves for detection probability.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposed a robust HRRP recognition method using prior jamming information (PSF) to handle ISRJ interference, outperforming SOTA methods with better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRRP-based radar target recognition suffers from serious feature distortion under electronic countermeasures like ISRJ, making reliable recognition challenging.

Method: Uses point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model HRRP distortion from ISRJ, designs recognition network with prior-guided feature interaction module and hybrid loss function.

Result: Method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both simulated and measured-data experiments, shows stronger generalization to unseen jamming parameters.

Conclusion: Prior jamming information guidance enables learning of invariant features in distorted HRRP, making radar target recognition robust against ISRJ interference.

Abstract: Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on high-resolution range profile (HRRP) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to capture fine-grained structural features. However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.

*Yunpeng Qu,Yazhou Sun,Bingyu Hui,Jian Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HIFI-YOLO framework for joint multi-signal detection and modulation recognition in wireless communications, addressing limitations of single-signal approaches and practical channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous AMR work focused on single signals, ignoring practical issues like multiple signal superposition in real channels and the need for signal detection before modulation recognition. RF signals are susceptible to noise and spectral variations in realistic conditions.

Method: Proposed HIFI-YOLO framework with hierarchical feature integration design that enhances feature representation across different modules. Created a large-scale AMR dataset specifically for multi-signal coexistence/overlapping scenarios with realistic propagation conditions and diverse modulation schemes.

Result: Extensive experiments on the new dataset demonstrate HIFI-YOLO's excellent performance in joint multi-signal detection and modulation recognition.

Conclusion: HIFI-YOLO effectively addresses the practical challenges of multi-signal scenarios in wireless communications through hierarchical feature integration and joint detection-recognition approach, showing superior performance on realistic multi-signal datasets.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a crucial step in wireless communication systems, which identifies the modulation scheme from detected signals to provide key information for further processing. However, previous work has mainly focused on the identification of a single signal, overlooking the phenomenon of multiple signal superposition in practical channels and the signal detection procedures that must be conducted beforehand. Considering the susceptibility of radio frequency (RF) signals to noise interference and significant spectral variations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Feature Integration (HIFI)-YOLO framework for multi-signal joint detection and modulation recognition. Our HIFI-YOLO framework, with its unique design of hierarchical feature integration, effectively enhances the representation capability of features in different modules, thereby improving detection performance. We construct a large-scale AMR dataset specifically tailored for scenarios of the coexistence or overlapping of multiple signals transmitted through channels with realistic propagation conditions, consisting of diverse digital and analog modulation schemes. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of HIFI-YOLO in multi-signal detection and modulation recognition as a joint approach.

*Daniele Gerosa,Lauri Anttila,Thomas Eriksson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a Kalman smoother method to track and compensate for correlated timing jitter in ADC arrays using VAR(1) modeling and pilot tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ADC jitter models treat timing errors as independent Gaussian noise, ignoring temporal correlations and spatial cross-correlations between channels in MIMO ADCs, which limits tracking and compensation capabilities.

Method: Models jitter as a coupled vector autoregressive process (VAR(1)), proposes a pilot-tone-based Kalman smoother for joint tracking and compensation of random, cross-correlated timing errors in ADC arrays.

Result: Simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in jitter-induced distortion across diverse scenarios compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VAR(1) modeling with Kalman smoother effectively addresses correlated timing errors in ADC arrays, significantly improving jitter compensation performance over traditional independent noise models.

Abstract: In modern communication systems, the fidelity of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is limited by sampling clock jitter, i.e., small random timing deviations that undermine ideal sampling. Traditional scalar models often treat jitter as independent Gaussian noise, which makes it essentially untrackable, whereas real ADCs also exhibit temporally correlated (spectrally colored) imperfections. Moreover, spatial cross-correlations between channels in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ADCs are commonly neglected. This paper addresses the joint tracking and compensation of random, cross-correlated timing errors in ADC arrays by modeling jitter as a coupled vector autoregressive process of order one (VAR(1)). We propose a pilot-tone-based Kalman smoother to track and compensate the jitter, and simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in jitter-induced distortion across diverse scenarios.

### [436] [LAYER: A Quantitative Explainable AI Framework for Decoding Tissue-Layer Drivers of Myofascial Low Back Pain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21767)
*Zixue Zeng,Anthony M. Perti,Tong Yu,Grant Kokenberger,Hao-En Lu,Jing Wang,Xin Meng,Zhiyu Sheng,Maryam Satarpour,John M. Cormack,Allison C. Bean,Ryan P. Nussbaum,Emily Landis-Walkenhorst,Kang Kim,Ajay D. Wasan,Jiantao Pu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LAYER is an explainable AI framework that analyzes six tissue layers in 3D ultrasound to predict myofascial pain, revealing that non-muscle tissues (especially deep fascial membrane) contribute substantially to pain prediction, challenging the muscle-centric paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myofascial pain is a leading cause of chronic low back pain but lacks reliable image biomarkers. Existing research focuses too much on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play important biomechanical roles.

Method: Developed LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), an anatomically grounded explainable AI framework that analyzes six tissue layers in 3D ultrasound. Used the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort with over 4,000 scans to quantify tissue contributions to pain prediction.

Result: In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane showed the highest saliency (0.420). In combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), showing non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction.

Conclusion: LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging. Challenges conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research.

Abstract: Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.

TL;DR: LesionAttn is a fairness-aware AI algorithm for dermatology that integrates clinical knowledge to mitigate gender bias in skin cancer diagnosis while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has shown promise in dermatology, gender bias in dermatologic AI remains underexplored despite extensive research on skin tone bias. This gender bias leads to unequal care and reinforces existing gender disparities in healthcare.

Method: Developed LesionAttn, a fairness-aware algorithm that integrates clinical knowledge by directing attention toward lesion regions (mirroring clinician diagnostic focus). Combined with Pareto-frontier optimization for dual-objective model selection to balance fairness and predictive accuracy.

Result: Validated on two large-scale dermatological datasets, LesionAttn significantly mitigates gender bias while maintaining high diagnostic performance, outperforming existing bias mitigation algorithms.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of embedding clinical knowledge into AI development to advance both model performance and fairness, and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians and AI developers.

### [438] [Comparing SAM 2 and SAM 3 for Zero-Shot Segmentation of 3D Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21926)
*Satrajit Chakrabarty,Ravi Soni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM 3 outperforms SAM 2 for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse anatomical structures and pathologies, making it the better default choice for most medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like SAM have shown promise for medical image segmentation, but their performance on medical data is not well characterized. SAM 3 introduces new architectural changes that may affect its behavior compared to widely-used SAM 2, but it's unclear if SAM 3 can serve as a direct replacement without customization.

Method: First controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos using purely visual prompting (concept mechanisms disabled). Evaluated on 16 public datasets covering CT, MRI, 3D/cine ultrasound, endoscopy with 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Used four prompt modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. Standardized preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to isolate prompt interpretation from propagation.

Result: SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies in full-volume analysis. SAM 3 emerges as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter, succeeding on challenging targets where SAM 2 frequently fails. SAM 2 remains competitive only for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance.

Conclusion: SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology. It can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization for most medical applications.

Abstract: Foundation models for promptable segmentation, including SAM, SAM 2, and the recently released SAM 3, have renewed interest in zero-shot segmentation of medical imaging. Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a conditional GAN approach to generate DEMs from freely available RGB satellite imagery, achieving promising results in mountainous regions with RMSE of 0.4671 and SSIM of 0.2065.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DEM generation methods (LiDAR, photogrammetry) require specific data that is often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. Need for cost-effective alternatives using freely available data.

Method: Uses conditional GAN with two-stage training: 1) trained on 12K RGB-DEM pairs from Landsat imagery and NASA SRTM data, 2) fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by SSIM values. Includes unique preprocessing pipeline for cloud-free regions and normalized RGB composites.

Result: Promising performance in mountainous regions with overall mean RMSE of 0.4671 and mean SSIM of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1). Limitations observed in lowland and residential areas.

Conclusion: Demonstrates cost-effective alternative to conventional DEM generation methods, emphasizing importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement. Highlights challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.

Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are vital datasets for geospatial applications such as hydrological modeling and environmental monitoring. However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.

### [440] [When Do Domain-Specific Foundation Models Justify Their Cost? A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22001)
*David Isztl,Tahm Spitznagel,Gabor Mark Somfai,Rui Santos*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Compact general-purpose vision models outperform or match large domain-specific foundation models for most retinal disease classification tasks, with specialized models only justified for challenging fine-grained discrimination under class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether large domain-specific foundation models are necessary for retinal disease classification, or if compact general-purpose architectures suffice, and to determine if specialized retinal pretraining justifies its computational cost.

Method: Benchmarked initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks (OCT 8-class, DME 3-class, DR 5-class, glaucoma 3-class) using 12-13 model configurations per task including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and domain-specific RETFound (303M) under identical training conditions.

Result: 1) Pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. 2) Compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. 3) RETFound (303M) only justifies computational cost for challenging DR grading (71.15% accuracy), while ImageNet pretraining suffices for all other tasks (DME: 99.24%, OCT: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%).

Conclusion: Compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models are only warranted for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.

Abstract: Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.

TL;DR: GACELLE is a GPU-accelerated MATLAB framework that dramatically speeds up quantitative MRI parameter estimation using stochastic gradient descent and MCMC sampling, enabling faster qMRI analysis with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitative MRI adoption in clinical research is hindered by slow computational processing times for parameter estimation, which constrains routine use and slows innovation and clinical translation.

Method: GACELLE provides an open-source GPU-accelerated framework with stochastic gradient descent optimizer and stochastic sampler in MATLAB. It features fully vectorized Markov chain Monte Carlo, automatic parallelization, memory-batching, and requires only a forward signal model from users.

Result: Benchmarks show up to 451× acceleration for gradient descent and 14,380× acceleration for stochastic sampling versus CPU-based estimation, with improved parameter precision, test-retest reproducibility, and reduced noise in quantitative maps across three qMRI models.

Conclusion: GACELLE lowers computational barriers for qMRI by combining speed, usability, and flexibility, enabling reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers tissue-specific biomarkers that can be tracked over time or compared across populations; however, its adoption in clinical research is hindered by significant computational demands of parameter estimation. Images acquired at high spatial resolution or requiring fitting multiple parameters often require lengthy processing time, constraining their use in routine pipelines and slowing methodological innovation and clinical translation.
  We present GACELLE, an open source, GPU-accelerated framework for high-throughput qMRI analysis. GACELLE provides a stochastic gradient descent optimiser and a stochastic sampler in MATLAB, enabling fast parameter mapping, improved estimation robustness via spatial regularisation, and uncertainty quantification. GACELLE prioritises accessibility: users only need to provide a forward signal model, while GACELLE's backend manages computational parallelisation, automatic parameter updates, and memory-batching. The stochastic solver performs fully vectorised Markov chain Monte Carlo with identical likelihood on CPU and GPU, ensuring reproducibility across hardware.
  Benchmarking demonstrates up to 451-fold acceleration for the stochastic gradient descent solver and 14,380-fold acceleration for stochastic sampling compared to CPU-based estimation, without compromising accuracy. We demonstrated GACELLE's versatility on three representative qMRI models and on an image reconstruction task. Across these applications, GACELLE improves parameter precision, enhances test-retest reproducibility, and reduces noise in quantitative maps.
  By combining speed, usability and flexibility, GACELLE provides a generalisable optimisation framework for medical image analysis. It lowers the computational barrier for qMRI, paving the way for reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.

*Zhiyi Jiang,Yifu Wang,Xuelian Cheng,Zongyuan Ge*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ColonAdapter: A self-supervised fine-tuning framework that adapts geometric foundation models for colonoscopy geometry estimation, addressing challenges like specularity and textureless regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D geometry estimation from monocular colonoscopy images is difficult due to non-Lambertian surfaces, moving light sources, and large textureless regions. Existing geometric foundation models trained on natural scenes perform poorly in clinical colonoscopy settings with specular reflections and homogeneous textures.

Method: A self-supervised fine-tuning framework that adapts pretrained geometric foundation models using: 1) Detail Restoration Module (DRM) for low-texture regions, 2) geometry consistency loss for scale consistency, and 3) confidence-weighted photometric loss for training stability in clinical environments.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets for camera pose estimation, monocular depth prediction, and dense 3D point map reconstruction, without requiring ground-truth intrinsic parameters.

Conclusion: ColonAdapter effectively adapts geometric foundation models to colonoscopy scenes, overcoming challenges of specularity and textureless regions while maintaining pretrained geometric priors, enabling accurate 3D geometry estimation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Estimating 3D geometry from monocular colonoscopy images is challenging due to non-Lambertian surfaces, moving light sources, and large textureless regions. While recent 3D geometric foundation models eliminate the need for multi-stage pipelines, their performance deteriorates in clinical scenes. These models are primarily trained on natural scene datasets and struggle with specularity and homogeneous textures typical in colonoscopy, leading to inaccurate geometry estimation. In this paper, we present ColonAdapter, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that adapts geometric foundation models for colonoscopy geometry estimation. Our method leverages pretrained geometric priors while tailoring them to clinical data. To improve performance in low-texture regions and ensure scale consistency, we introduce a Detail Restoration Module (DRM) and a geometry consistency loss. Furthermore, a confidence-weighted photometric loss enhances training stability in clinical environments. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, monocular depth prediction, and dense 3D point map reconstruction, without requiring ground-truth intrinsic parameters.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First content-adaptive encoding approach for interactive game streaming using CNN to predict optimal resolution from past frame metadata, achieving 2.3 BD-VMAF improvement with 1ms inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While content-adaptive encoding (CAE) benefits video-on-demand streaming, it's challenging for interactive game streaming (IGS) due to ultra-low latency requirements, no lookahead/buffering, and tight compute constraints.

Method: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer optimal resolution from aggregated coding block statistics of past frames within a running window, deployed in practical HEVC-based IGS setup.

Result: Improves over default fixed-resolution HEVC ladder by 2.3 Bjøntegaard Delta-VMAF points with only 1ms inference time per scene using single CPU core, adding no latency overhead.

Conclusion: Proposed CAE approach successfully addresses IGS challenges by enabling efficient resolution adaptation using compact past-frame metadata, achieving significant quality improvements without latency penalties.

Abstract: Video-on-demand streaming has benefitted from \textit{content-adaptive encoding} (CAE), i.e., adaptation of resolution and/or quantization parameters for each scene based on convex hull optimization. However, CAE is very challenging to develop and deploy for interactive game streaming (IGS). Commercial IGS services impose ultra-low latency encoding with no lookahead or buffering, and have extremely tight compute constraints for any CAE algorithm execution. We propose the first CAE approach for resolution adaptation in IGS based on compact encoding metadata from past frames. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the best resolution from the options available for the upcoming scene based on a running window of aggregated coding block statistics from the current scene. By deploying the trained CNN within a practical IGS setup based on HEVC encoding, our proposal: (i) improves over the default fixed-resolution ladder of HEVC by 2.3 Bjøntegaard Delta-VMAF points; (ii) infers using 1ms of a single CPU core per scene, thereby having no latency overhead.

*Rowzatul Zannath Prerona*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SG-Net introduces hard spatial gating to solve the "over-segmentation paradox" in brain metastasis segmentation, achieving better precision and boundary accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain metastasis segmentation faces challenges due to small lesion sizes (5-15 mm) and extreme class imbalance (<2% tumor volume). Traditional soft-attention CNNs suffer from "over-segmentation paradox" - high sensitivity but catastrophic precision collapse and boundary errors (>150 mm), posing risks for stereotactic radiosurgery planning.

Method: Introduces Spatial Gating Network (SG-Net), a precision-first architecture using hard spatial gating mechanisms. Unlike soft attention, SG-Net enforces strict feature selection to aggressively suppress background artifacts while preserving tumor features.

Result: On Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI dataset (n=92), SG-Net achieves Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5578 +/- 0.0243, statistically outperforming Attention U-Net and ResU-Net (p < 0.001). Shows threefold improvement in boundary precision (95% Hausdorff Distance: 56.13 mm vs 157.52 mm), maintains robust recall (0.79) and superior precision (0.52 vs 0.20). Uses only 0.67M parameters (8.8x fewer than Attention U-Net).

Conclusion: Hard spatial gating provides a robust solution for precision-driven lesion detection, directly enhancing radiosurgery accuracy while being deployable in resource-constrained environments due to parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Brain metastasis segmentation in MRI remains a formidable challenge due to diminutive lesion sizes (5-15 mm) and extreme class imbalance (less than 2% tumor volume). While soft-attention CNNs are widely used, we identify a critical failure mode termed the "over-segmentation paradox," where models achieve high sensitivity (recall > 0.88) but suffer from catastrophic precision collapse (precision < 0.23) and boundary errors exceeding 150 mm. This imprecision poses significant risks for stereotactic radiosurgery planning. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Gating Network (SG-Net), a precision-first architecture employing hard spatial gating mechanisms. Unlike traditional soft attention, SG-Net enforces strict feature selection to aggressively suppress background artifacts while preserving tumor features. Validated on the Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI dataset (n=92), SG-Net achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5578 +/- 0.0243 (95% CI: 0.45-0.67), statistically outperforming Attention U-Net (p < 0.001) and ResU-Net (p < 0.001). Most critically, SG-Net demonstrates a threefold improvement in boundary precision, achieving a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 56.13 mm compared to 157.52 mm for Attention U-Net, while maintaining robust recall (0.79) and superior precision (0.52 vs. 0.20). Furthermore, SG-Net requires only 0.67M parameters (8.8x fewer than Attention U-Net), facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. These findings establish hard spatial gating as a robust solution for precision-driven lesion detection, directly enhancing radiosurgery accuracy.

TL;DR: TokCom-UEP proposes a semantic importance-matched unequal error protection framework for resilient image transmission in token communication systems, outperforming equal error protection schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token communication designs assume uniform token importance and use equal error protection, but compressed 1D token sequences have heterogeneous semantic importance hierarchies, making EEP suboptimal.

Method: Integrates rateless UEP coding with non-uniform semantic importance by partitioning source tokens into nested expanding windows, assigning higher selection probabilities to windows containing critical tokens for prioritized recovery.

Result: Outperforms EEP schemes in three core semantic restoration metrics and spectral efficiency under low-overhead conditions.

Conclusion: TokCom-UEP provides a novel semantic importance-matched UEP framework that better aligns error protection with the inherent semantic importance hierarchies in token communication for more resilient image transmission.

A key limitation of existing TokCom designs lies in the assumption of uniform token importance, which leads to the adoption of equal error protection (EEP). However, compressed one-dimensional (1D) token sequences inherently exhibit heterogeneous semantic importance hierarchies, rendering EEP schemes suboptimal. To address this, this paper proposes TokCom-UEP, a novel semantic importance-matched unequal error protection (UEP) framework designed for resilient image transmission. TokCom-UEP integrates rateless UEP coding with the non-uniform semantic importance of tokens by partitioning source tokens into nested expanding windows, assigning higher selection probabilities to windows containing critical tokens to ensure their prioritized recovery. Simulation results demonstrate that TokCom-UEP outperforms EEP schemes in terms of three core semantic restoration metrics and spectral efficiency under low-overhead conditions.

*Shreyas Jayant Grampurohit,Satish Mulleti,Ajit Rajwade*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A method for 2D tomography that jointly estimates unknown projection angles and spatial shifts, improving reconstruction quality for misaligned projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In industrial and biomedical CT imaging, projection geometry (angles and spatial shifts) is often unknown, but existing 2D unknown view tomography algorithms assume centered projections without shifts, limiting practical applications.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Modified graph Laplacian-based algorithm to incorporate spatial shifts, 2) Three-way alternating minimization that jointly estimates 2D structure, projection angles, and corresponding shifts.

Result: The method achieves superior reconstruction compared to baseline methods that neglect shifts, as demonstrated on noisy ribosome image projections.

Conclusion: The proposed technique successfully handles both unknown viewing angles and spatial shifts in 2D tomography, providing more accurate reconstructions for practical applications where projection geometry is partially unknown.

Abstract: In parallel beam computed tomography (CT), an object is reconstructed from a series of projections taken at different angles. However, in some industrial and biomedical imaging applications, the projection geometry is unknown, completely or partially. In this paper, we present a technique for two-dimensional (2D) tomography in which both viewing angles and spatial shifts associated with the projections are unknown. There exists literature on 2D unknown view tomography (UVT), but most existing 2D UVT algorithms assume that the projections are centered; that is, there are no spatial shifts in the projections. To tackle these geometric ambiguities, we first modify an existing graph Laplacian-based algorithm for 2D UVT to incorporate spatial shifts, and then use it as the initialization for the proposed three-way alternating minimization algorithm that jointly estimates the 2D structure, its projection angles, and the corresponding shifts. We evaluate our method on noisy projections of ribosome images and demonstrate that it achieves superior reconstruction compared to the baseline that neglects shifts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual instance-level annotation for tooth segmentation in dental imaging (OPGs and CBCT) is labor-intensive, creating a data scarcity problem that hinders development of automated segmentation methods.

Method: Organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2024 with a large-scale dataset (90,000+ 2D images and 3D axial slices), evaluated top-performing deep learning SSL methods from participating teams.

Result: SSL methods achieved dramatic improvements: top OPG method improved Instance Affinity score by 44+ percentage points; top CBCT method boosted Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points over fully-supervised baseline.

Conclusion: SSL provides substantial benefits for complex instance-level medical image segmentation with scarce labeled data; most effective approaches used hybrid SSL frameworks combining foundational models like SAM with multi-stage refinement pipelines.

Abstract: Orthopantomogram (OPGs) and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) are vital for dentistry, but creating large datasets for automated tooth segmentation is hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual instance-level annotation. This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines. Both the challenge dataset and the participants' submitted code have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2024), ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

### [448] [Deep Learning for Restoring MPI System Matrices Using Simulated Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23251)
*Artyom Tsanda,Sarah Reiss,Marija Boberg,Tobias Knopp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models trained on physics-based simulated system matrices can effectively generalize to real magnetic particle imaging data for various restoration tasks like denoising, upsampling, accelerated calibration, and inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic particle imaging relies on system matrices obtained through time-consuming, noisy calibration measurements. Deep learning approaches for system matrix restoration face data scarcity issues, as curated training data from real measurements are limited.

Method: Generated a large dataset of physics-based simulated system matrices using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans various particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, with injected background noise from empty-frame measurements. Trained deep learning models (DnCNN, RDN, SwinIR, SMRnet, PConvUNet) on simulated data and compared them with classical non-learning baselines for four restoration tasks: denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting.

Result: Models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: For denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations, leading to perceptually better reconstructions of real data. For 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at ×2-×4 scales, though qualitative transfer to real measurements was limited. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise. For 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions.

Conclusion: The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem in magnetic particle imaging and enables the development of new restoration methods beyond current measurement capabilities.

Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging reconstructs tracer distributions using a system matrix obtained through time-consuming, noise-prone calibration measurements. Methods for addressing imperfections in measured system matrices increasingly rely on deep neural networks, yet curated training data remain scarce. This study evaluates whether physics-based simulated system matrices can be used to train deep learning models for different system matrix restoration tasks, i.e., denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting, that generalize to measured data. A large system matrices dataset was generated using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, and includes background noise injected from empty-frame measurements. For each restoration task, deep learning models were compared with classical non-learning baseline methods. The models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: for denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations and led to perceptually better reconstuctions of real data; for 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at $\times 2$-$\times 4$ which did not transfer qualitatively to real measurements. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise, and for 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while a PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions. The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem and enables the development of new methods beyond current measurement capabilities.
