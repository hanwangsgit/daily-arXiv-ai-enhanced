*Suraj Prasad,Anubha Pant*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful replication study of FedTPG achieves results within 0.2% of original paper's reported accuracies, validating its text-driven prompt generation approach for federated learning with CLIP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP have strong zero-shot capabilities but face challenges adapting to federated learning scenarios, particularly regarding generalization to unseen classes. The original FedTPG paper addressed this limitation, and this work aims to validate its claims through replication.

Method: Replication study of FedTPG's approach using text-driven prompt generation network that dynamically creates prompts conditioned on class names. Evaluated the pre-trained model on six diverse vision datasets: Caltech101, Oxford Flowers, FGVC Aircraft, Oxford Pets, Food-101, and DTD.

Result: Achieved results within 0.2% of original paper's reported accuracies, with average accuracy of 74.58% on seen (base) classes and 76.00% on unseen (new) classes, demonstrating +1.43 percentage point improvement in generalization.

Conclusion: The successful replication validates FedTPG's core claims: (1) text-driven prompt generation enables superior generalization to unseen classes compared to static prompt learning methods, and (2) federated training of prompt generators maintains high performance across diverse visual domains without sharing private data. Confirms robustness and reproducibility of the FedTPG approach.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities, yet their adaptation to federated learning scenarios presents significant
  challenges, particularly regarding generalization to unseen classes. The original FedTPG paper \cite{Qiu2024} addresses this limitation by introducing a text driven prompt generation network that dynamically creates prompts conditioned on class names, enabling better cross-class generalization in federated settings. In
  this work, we present a faithful replication study of FedTPG, evaluating the pre-trained model on six diverse vision datasets: Caltech101, Oxford Flowers, FGVC Aircraft,
  Oxford Pets, Food-101, and DTD. Our evaluation achieves results within 0.2\% of the original paper's reported accuracies, with an average accuracy of 74.58\% on seen
  (base) classes and 76.00\% on unseen (new) classes, demonstrating a +1.43 percentage point improvement in generalization. These results validate the original
  paper's core claims: (1) text-driven prompt generation enables superior generalization to unseen classes compared to static prompt learning methods, and (2)
  federated training of prompt generators maintains high performance across diverse visual domains without sharing private data. Our successful replication confirms
  the robustness and reproducibility of the FedTPG approach.

### [2] [A Patient-Specific Digital Twin for Adaptive Radiotherapy of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18496)
*Anvi Sud,Jialu Huang,Gregory R. Hart,Keshav Saxena,John Kim,Lauren Tressel,Jun Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPASS is a temporal digital twin system that uses AI to model normal tissue response in radiotherapy by analyzing per-fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and BED data to predict toxicity earlier than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiotherapy generates high-frequency imaging and dosimetry data, but clinical decisions rely on static, population-based NTCP models that ignore dynamic biological trajectories. There's a need for personalized, temporal modeling to capture individual tissue evolution during treatment.

Method: Developed COMPASS as a temporal digital twin architecture using per-fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative BED kinetics. Employed a GRU autoencoder to learn organ-specific latent trajectories, then classified these trajectories via logistic regression to predict CTCAE grade 1+ toxicity. Tested on 8 NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT with 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories.

Result: Despite small cohort, system identified viable AI-driven early warning window where increasing risk ratings occurred several fractions before clinical toxicity. Dense BED-driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that precede toxicity and are missed by traditional volume-based dosimetry.

Conclusion: COMPASS establishes proof-of-concept for AI-enabled adaptive radiotherapy where treatment is guided by continually updated digital twins tracking each patient's evolving biological response, enabling earlier toxicity prediction than current methods.

Abstract: Radiotherapy continues to become more precise and data dense, with current treatment regimens generating high frequency imaging and dosimetry streams ideally suited for AI driven temporal modeling to characterize how normal tissues evolve with time. Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry. COMPASS establishes a proof of concept for AI enabled adaptive radiotherapy, where treatment is guided by a continually updated digital twin that tracks each patients evolving biological response.

### [3] [Scaling Ultrasound Volumetric Reconstruction via Mobile Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18500)
*Kian Wei Ng,Yujia Gao,Deborah Khoo,Ying Zhen Tan,Chengzheng Mao,Haojie Cheng,Andrew Makmur,Kee Yuan Ngiam,Serene Goh,Eng Tat Khoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARVUS is a mobile augmented reality system that enables accurate 3D volume measurements from conventional 2D ultrasound without specialized hardware, improving accuracy and reducing variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D ultrasound is widely used for breast/thyroid imaging but has high inter-user variability in volume estimation. Existing 3D ultrasound solutions require expensive specialized hardware that limits accessibility.

Method: MARVUS uses a foundation model to enable 3D reconstruction from conventional 2D ultrasound systems, combined with mobile augmented reality visualizations for guidance and measurement.

Result: In user studies with clinicians on breast phantoms, MARVUS improved volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm³) and reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm³). AR visualizations enhanced both objective metrics and clinician-reported usability.

Conclusion: MARVUS provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for accurate volumetric assessment in ultrasound-based cancer screening and treatment planning, overcoming hardware limitations of current 3D ultrasound systems.

Abstract: Accurate volumetric characterization of lesions is essential for oncologic diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

### [4] [Depth-Enhanced YOLO-SAM2 Detection for Reliable Ballast Insufficiency Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18961)
*Shiyu Liu,Dylan Lester,Husnu Narman,Ammar Alzarrad,Pingping Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework improves ballast insufficiency detection in railway tracks using RGB-D data, boosting recall from 0.49 to 0.80 and F1-score from 0.66 to over 0.80.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-only YOLOv8 shows limited safety performance for ballast insufficiency detection with high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49), tending to over-predict sufficient class, which is problematic for railway safety.

Method: Proposes depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework with sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing to compensate for RealSense spatial distortion. SAM2 segmentation refines region-of-interest masks for accurate sleeper and ballast profile extraction for geometric classification.

Result: Depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve detection: recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80, depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria.

Conclusion: Integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

### [5] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning via Feature Disentanglement in Medical Imaging: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18502)
*Sarah Müller,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcut learning in medical imaging, showing that combining data rebalancing with model disentanglement achieves robust shortcut mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on shortcut learning (exploiting spurious correlations), which poses risks for clinical deployment where models must generalize across different institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions.

Method: Systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. Assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders.

Result: Shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations. Latent space analyses revealed representation quality differences not captured by classification metrics. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on degree of confounding. Best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement achieves stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency, providing a comprehensive approach to address shortcut learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Although deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve excellent classification performance, they can rely on shortcut learning, exploiting spurious correlations or confounding factors that are not causally related to the target task. This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.

### [6] [Face Presentation Attack Detection via Content-Adaptive Spatial Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18965)
*Shujaat Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASO-PAD is a lightweight RGB-only face anti-spoofing model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators to better capture localized spoof cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face presentation attack detection is crucial for securing facial authentication systems against various spoofing attacks (print, replay, mask-based). Existing methods often require auxiliary sensors or temporal information, making them less practical for on-device deployment. There's a need for lightweight, single-frame RGB-only models that can effectively detect spoofing attacks with mobile-class compute constraints.

Method: The paper proposes CASO-PAD, which enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution). Unlike traditional convolution with spatially shared kernels, this operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity for capturing localized spoof cues. The model is trained end-to-end using binary cross-entropy loss and remains lightweight (3.6M parameters, 0.64 GFLOPs at 256×256 resolution).

Result: CASO-PAD achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks: 100/100/98.9/99.7% test accuracy on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU respectively, with corresponding AUCs of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999 and HTERs of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44%. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, it attains 95.45% accuracy with 3.11% HTER and 3.13% EER. Ablation studies show optimal placement of adaptive operators near the network head with moderate group sharing.

Conclusion: CASO-PAD provides a practical solution for robust, on-device face presentation attack detection using only RGB input and single frames. The content-adaptive spatial operators effectively capture localized spoof cues while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for mobile deployment, offering a pathway to secure facial authentication without auxiliary sensors or temporal processing.

Abstract: Face presentation attack detection (FacePAD) is critical for securing facial authentication against print, replay, and mask-based spoofing. This paper proposes CASO-PAD, an RGB-only, single-frame model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to better capture localized spoof cues. Unlike spatially shared convolution kernels, the proposed operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity with minimal overhead. CASO-PAD remains lightweight (3.6M parameters; 0.64 GFLOPs at $256\times256$) and is trained end-to-end using a standard binary cross-entropy objective. Extensive experiments on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU demonstrate strong performance, achieving 100/100/98.9/99.7\% test accuracy, AUC of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999, and HTER of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44\%, respectively. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, CASO-PAD further attains 95.45\% accuracy with 3.11\% HTER and 3.13\% EER, indicating improved robustness under diverse real-world attacks. Ablation studies show that placing the adaptive operator near the network head and using moderate group sharing yields the best accuracy--efficiency balance. Overall, CASO-PAD provides a practical pathway for robust, on-device FacePAD with mobile-class compute and without auxiliary sensors or temporal stacks.

### [7] [A Computer Vision Framework for Multi-Class Detection and Tracking in Soccer Broadcast Footage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18504)
*Daniel Tshiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-camera computer vision pipeline extracts soccer player tracking data from broadcast footage, enabling affordable analytics for lower-budget teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional teams with expensive multi-camera/GPS systems have competitive data advantages, while lower-budget teams lack access to similar tracking data. Need affordable alternative using standard broadcast footage.

Method: End-to-end system combining YOLO object detector with ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and ball from single broadcast camera footage.

Result: High performance in detecting/tracking players and officials with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores. Ball detection remains primary challenge, but system successfully extracts meaningful player-level spatial information.

Conclusion: AI can extract valuable soccer analytics from single broadcast camera, reducing reliance on specialized hardware. Enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis previously limited to professional teams.

Abstract: Clubs with access to expensive multi-camera setups or GPS tracking systems gain a competitive advantage through detailed data, whereas lower-budget teams are often unable to collect similar information. This paper examines whether such data can instead be extracted directly from standard broadcast footage using a single-camera computer vision pipeline. This project develops an end-to-end system that combines a YOLO object detector with the ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball throughout a match. Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera. By reducing reliance on specialized hardware, the proposed approach enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis methods previously accessible only to professional teams, highlighting the potential for affordable computer vision-based soccer analytics.

### [8] [Training Deep Stereo Matching Networks on Tree Branch Imagery: A Benchmark Study for Real-Time UAV Forestry Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19763)
*Yida Lin,Bing Xue,Mengjie Zhang,Sam Schofield,Richard Green*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First study training/testing 10 deep stereo networks on real tree branch images for drone-based pruning, finding BANet-3D best for quality, RAFT-Stereo best for scene understanding, and AnyNet fastest for near-real-time operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drone-based tree pruning requires accurate, real-time depth estimation from stereo cameras, where small disparity errors cause significant depth mistakes at working distances.

Method: Trained and tested 10 deep stereo matching networks on the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset (5,313 stereo pairs) using DEFOM-generated disparity maps as training targets. Methods covered step-by-step refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs. Evaluated using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), with real-time testing on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super mounted on a drone.

Result: BANet-3D produced best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), RAFT-Stereo scored highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). AnyNet reached 6.99 FPS at 1080P (only near-real-time option), while BANet-2D gave best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. Also compared 720P vs 1080P processing times.

Conclusion: This study provides comprehensive evaluation of stereo matching networks for forestry drone applications, identifying trade-offs between quality, speed, and scene understanding to guide resolution choices for autonomous tree pruning systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drone-based tree pruning needs accurate, real-time depth estimation from stereo cameras. Depth is computed from disparity maps using $Z = f B/d$, so even small disparity errors cause noticeable depth mistakes at working distances. Building on our earlier work that identified DEFOM-Stereo as the best reference disparity generator for vegetation scenes, we present the first study to train and test ten deep stereo matching networks on real tree branch images. We use the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset -- 5,313 stereo pairs from a ZED Mini camera at 1080P and 720P -- with DEFOM-generated disparity maps as training targets. The ten methods cover step-by-step refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs. Using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), we find that BANet-3D produces the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), while RAFT-Stereo scores highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). Testing on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super (16 GB, independently powered) mounted on our drone shows that AnyNet reaches 6.99 FPS at 1080P -- the only near-real-time option -- while BANet-2D gives the best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. We also compare 720P and 1080P processing times to guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems.

### [9] [Suppression or Deletion: A Restoration-Based Representation-Level Analysis of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18505)
*Yurim Jang,Jaeung Lee,Dohyun Kim,Jaemin Jo,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Most unlearning methods only suppress information at decision boundaries rather than truly deleting it from representations, posing privacy risks that output-based metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning evaluations rely on output-based metrics that can't verify if information is truly deleted or just suppressed at the representation level, which is insufficient for privacy-critical applications.

Method: Proposed a restoration-based analysis framework using Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish suppression from deletion.

Result: Evaluated 12 major unlearning methods in image classification: most achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating they only suppress information at decision boundaries while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration.

Conclusion: Representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: As pretrained models are increasingly shared on the web, ensuring that models can forget or delete sensitive, copyrighted, or private information upon request has become crucial. Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models.

### [10] [Transcending the Annotation Bottleneck: AI-Powered Discovery in Biology and Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20100)
*Soumick Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods are revolutionizing biomedical AI by enabling analysis of biobank-scale datasets without expert annotation, discovering novel phenotypes and linking morphology to genetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary bottleneck in biomedical AI has been dependence on expert annotation. Supervised learning requires extensive labeled data, which limits scalability and introduces human bias. There's a need for methods that can leverage the vast amounts of unlabeled biomedical data available in biobanks and clinical repositories.

Method: The paper focuses on unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that learn directly from the intrinsic structure of data. These methods work with various data modalities: pixels in MRI images, voxels in volumetric scans, and tokens in genomic sequences. The frameworks enable discovery of patterns without human-labeled training data.

Result: These label-free learning methods have achieved significant breakthroughs: deriving heritable cardiac traits from imaging data, predicting spatial gene expression patterns in histology, and detecting pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised methods. They facilitate discovery of novel phenotypes and linkage of morphology to genetics.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from supervised learning to unsupervised and self-supervised learning is unlocking the potential of biobank-scale biomedical datasets. These methods overcome the annotation bottleneck, reduce human bias, and enable discoveries that were previously impossible with supervised approaches alone.

Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.

### [11] [Depth from Defocus via Direct Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18509)
*Holly Jackson,Caleb Adams,Ignacio Lopez-Francos,Benjamin Recht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Global optimization approach for depth from defocus using alternating minimization, outperforming deep learning methods at higher resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth from defocus is computationally challenging despite having a reasonable forward model based on optical physics. The paper aims to show that with modern optimization methods and computing resources, a global optimization approach is feasible.

Method: Alternating minimization approach: 1) When depth map is fixed, solve linear forward model for all-in-focus image. 2) When all-in-focus image is fixed, compute depth at each pixel independently using parallel grid search. Alternates between convex optimization and parallel grid search.

Result: The approach effectively solves depth-from-defocus at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. Demonstrates promising results on benchmark datasets with both synthetic and real defocus blur compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: A global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible with contemporary optimization methods and computing resources, achieving competitive performance without deep learning.

Abstract: Though there exists a reasonable forward model for blur based on optical physics, recovering depth from a collection of defocused images remains a computationally challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. We demonstrate our approach on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real defocus blur and show promising results compared to prior approaches. Our code is available at github.com/hollyjackson/dfd.

### [12] [Sketch2Feedback: Grammar-in-the-Loop Framework for Rubric-Aligned Feedback on Student STEM Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18520)
*Aayam Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sketch2Feedback is a grammar-in-the-loop framework that reduces hallucinations in AI feedback for student-drawn STEM diagrams by decomposing the problem into hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a persistent challenge in providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams in STEM education. While large multimodal models can parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments.

Method: Sketch2Feedback decomposes the problem into four stages: hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback. This ensures the language model only verbalizes violations verified by an upstream rule engine, reducing hallucinations.

Result: Results show mixed performance: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528) but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). The grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). Confidence thresholding reduces hallucination with no F1 loss.

Conclusion: The grammar-in-the-loop framework reduces hallucinations in AI feedback for student diagrams, demonstrating complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. The method produces more actionable feedback, though performance varies by domain, with FBD detection being more resilient to noise than circuit detection.

Abstract: Providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams is a persistent challenge in STEM education. While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply. An LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms that the grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than the end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). We release all code, datasets, and evaluation scripts.

### [13] [Do Generative Metrics Predict YOLO Performance? An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525)
*Vasile Marian,Yong-Bin Kang,Alexander Buddery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic image augmentation for object detection is evaluated across three regimes, showing substantial gains in challenging scenarios but marginal benefits in simpler ones, with metric-performance alignment being regime-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative metrics (like FID) often fail to predict downstream detection performance, making it difficult to evaluate synthetic datasets before training. There's a need for better evaluation methods to understand when and how synthetic augmentation works for object detection.

Method: Controlled evaluation across three single-class detection regimes using six different generators (GAN, diffusion, hybrid). Trained YOLOv11 from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, testing augmentation ratios from 10% to 150%. Used matched-size bootstrap protocol with global feature-space metrics (Inception-v3, DINOv2) and object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics.

Result: Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in challenging regimes (+7.6% relative mAP for Pedestrian, +30.6% for PottedPlant) but marginal benefits in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. Metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent, with many apparent raw associations weakening after controlling for augmentation level.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of synthetic augmentation depends heavily on the detection regime, and standard generative metrics don't reliably predict downstream performance. Better evaluation methods are needed that account for regime-specific factors and control for augmentation quantity when assessing metric-performance relationships.

Abstract: Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.

TL;DR: JAEGER extends audio-visual LLMs to 3D space using RGB-D and spatial audio, introducing Neural IV representation and SpatialSceneQA benchmark for improved spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV-LLMs are limited to 2D perception (RGB video + monaural audio), creating a dimensionality mismatch that prevents reliable source localization and spatial reasoning in 3D environments.

Method: Proposes JAEGER framework integrating RGB-D observations and multi-channel first-order ambisonics. Introduces Neural IV (neural intensity vector) - a learned spatial audio representation for robust directional cues. Creates SpatialSceneQA benchmark with 61k instruction-tuning samples from simulated environments.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms 2D-centric baselines across diverse spatial perception and reasoning tasks, demonstrating the necessity of explicit 3D modeling for AI in physical environments.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D modeling is essential for advancing AI in physical environments, and JAEGER provides an effective framework for joint spatial grounding and reasoning through integrated 3D audio-visual perception.

Abstract: Current audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) are predominantly restricted to 2D perception, relying on RGB video and monaural audio. This design choice introduces a fundamental dimensionality mismatch that precludes reliable source localization and spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. We address this limitation by presenting JAEGER, a framework that extends AV-LLMs to 3D space, to enable joint spatial grounding and reasoning through the integration of RGB-D observations and multi-channel first-order ambisonics. A core contribution of our work is the neural intensity vector (Neural IV), a learned spatial audio representation that encodes robust directional cues to enhance direction-of-arrival estimation, even in adverse acoustic scenarios with overlapping sources. To facilitate large-scale training and systematic evaluation, we propose SpatialSceneQA, a benchmark of 61k instruction-tuning samples curated from simulated physical environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses 2D-centric baselines across diverse spatial perception and reasoning tasks, underscoring the necessity of explicit 3D modelling for advancing AI in physical environments. Our source code, pre-trained model checkpoints and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures can effectively classify Turkish black table olive varieties, with EfficientNet models performing best. Parametric efficiency outweighs model depth for limited data scenarios, providing practical guidance for agricultural classification tasks.

Abstract: This study compares multiple deep learning architectures for the automated, image-based classification of five locally cultivated black table olive varieties in Turkey: Gemlik, Ayvalik, Uslu, Erkence, and Celebi. Using a dataset of 2500 images, ten architectures - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-B16, and Swin-T - were trained using transfer learning. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, ROC-AUC, number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and generalization gap. EfficientNetV2-S achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Overall, the results indicate that under limited data conditions, parametric efficiency plays a more critical role than model depth alone.

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of Vision-Language-Action model design space identifies 12 key findings for building effective VLAs, resulting in VLANeXt model that outperforms SOTA on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The VLA landscape is fragmented with inconsistent training protocols and evaluation settings, making it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter for effective policy learning.

Method: Reexamines VLA design space under unified framework, starting from simple baseline similar to RT-2/OpenVLA, systematically dissecting design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives.

Result: Distills 12 key findings forming practical recipe for building strong VLA models, resulting in VLANeXt model that outperforms prior SOTA methods on LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks with strong real-world generalization.

Conclusion: Provides structured approach to VLA design with unified codebase for community to reproduce findings, explore design space, and build new VLA variants on shared foundation.

Abstract: Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.

### [17] [Morphological Addressing of Identity Basins in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18533)
*Andrew Fraser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Morphological structure creates navigable gradients in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling identity navigation without names/photos and generating coherent visual concepts from nonsense words with sound-symbolic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how morphological structure (feature descriptors and phonological patterns) creates systematic navigational gradients in diffusion model latent spaces, enabling identity manipulation and novel concept generation without direct training data.

Method: Two studies: 1) Self-distillation loop using morphological descriptors to train LoRAs for identity navigation in Stable Diffusion 1.5, measuring ArcFace similarity; 2) Generating 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters to test visual coherence using Purity@1 metric.

Result: Study 1: Achieved consistent convergence toward specific identities using morphological descriptors alone; LoRAs created local coordinate systems producing both target identities and their "uncanny valley" inverses. Study 2: Phonestheme-bearing nonsense words produced significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (Purity@1 = 0.371 vs. 0.209, p<0.00001); three candidates achieved perfect visual consistency with distinct visual identities.

Conclusion: Morphological structure creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces, enabling identity manipulation without direct references and generating novel visual concepts from sub-lexical sound patterns, revealing phase transitions in identity basins and CFG-invariant identity stability.

Abstract: We demonstrate that morphological pressure creates navigable gradients at multiple levels of the text-to-image generative pipeline. In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \emph{cr-}, \emph{sn-}, \emph{-oid}, \emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \emph{snudgeoid}, \emph{crashax}, and \emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces. We document phase transitions in identity basins, CFG-invariant identity stability, and novel visual concepts emerging from sub-lexical sound patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rodent-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to annotate rodent behavior videos, but current state-of-the-art models perform poorly and can't be used as assistants for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to evaluate how well Multimodal Large Language Models can annotate rodent behavior footage for neuroscience research, as automated behavioral annotation would be valuable but current capabilities are unknown.

Method: Created Rodent-Bench with diverse datasets covering social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors (10-35 minute videos). Evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Qwen-VL-Max) using standardized metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient.

Result: None of the tested models performed strongly enough to be used as assistants for rodent behavior annotation. Some showed modest performance on specific datasets (like grooming detection), but overall revealed significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling long videos, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant limitations for scientific video annotation. Rodent-Bench provides a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience, highlighting key areas for future model development.

Abstract: We present Rodent-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to annotate rodent behaviour footage. We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. While some models show modest performance on certain datasets (notably grooming detection), overall results reveal significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling extended video sequences, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states. Our analysis identifies key limitations in current MLLMs for scientific video annotation and provides insights for future model development. Rodent-Bench serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking YOLO architectures for flower detection using new FloralSix dataset with two annotation regimes (SISBB/SIMBB), showing YOLOv8m excels in sparse scenarios while YOLOv12n performs best in dense detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise flower localization and recognition is crucial for automated agriculture applications like plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring, requiring robust detection methods for both isolated and clustered flowers.

Method: Benchmarked YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n architectures on new FloralSix dataset (2,816 images of 6 flower species) with two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). Evaluated using Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 metrics.

Result: YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved best SISBB results: Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865. YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed in SIMBB with mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752. SGD optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives.

Conclusion: Annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact significantly: recall-optimized models excel in crowded environments while precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. These density-sensitive detectors enable non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.

Abstract: Precise localization and recognition of flowers are crucial for advancing automated agriculture, particularly in plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring. This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.

*Massoud Dehghan,Ramona Woitek,Amirreza Mahbod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smaller patch sizes (1, 2, 4) consistently improve ViT classification performance on medical imaging datasets, with ensemble of these patch sizes providing further performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Vision Transformers have become state-of-the-art in computer vision, the impact of patch size - a crucial initial design choice - remains underexplored, especially in medical domains with both 2D and 3D imaging modalities.

Method: Conducted thorough evaluation using 12 medical imaging datasets (7 2D, 5 3D) with ViT models fine-tuned using different patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28) on a single GPU, and applied ensemble strategy combining predictions from models with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4.

Result: Smaller patch sizes (1, 2, 4) achieved best results across nearly all datasets: up to 12.78% balanced accuracy improvement for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% improvement for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14). Ensemble strategy further boosted performance, especially for 2D datasets.

Conclusion: Smaller patch sizes significantly improve ViT classification performance in medical imaging, though at increased computational cost. Ensemble of models with small patch sizes provides additional performance gains, offering practical guidance for medical ViT design.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their variants have become state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks and are widely used as backbones in large-scale vision and vision-language foundation models. While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.
  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/HealMaDe/MedViT

TL;DR: A novel approach for generating realistic speaking/talking faces from a static image, voice profile, and target text using multi-entangled latent space for audio-video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic talking face generation that can synthesize both audio (voice) and video (facial movements) from minimal inputs - just a static image, voice profile, and target text, enabling personalized talking face creation.

Method: The model encodes three inputs: driving text, driving image, and voice profile. These are combined and passed to a multi-entangled latent space that establishes spatiotemporal person-specific features between modalities. The entangled features generate key-value pairs and queries for audio and video generation pipelines, which are then passed to respective decoders for final output.

Result: The approach successfully generates realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing both voice and facial movements from the given inputs, with the multi-entangled latent space effectively capturing person-specific features across modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective generation of personalized talking faces from minimal inputs, with the multi-entangled latent space playing a crucial role in establishing cross-modal person-specific features for realistic audio-video synthesis.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing a person's voice and facial movements from a static image, a voice profile, and a target text. The model encodes the prompt/driving text, the driving image, and the voice profile of an individual and then combines them to pass them to the multi-entangled latent space to foster key-value pairs and queries for the audio and video modality generation pipeline. The multi-entangled latent space is responsible for establishing the spatiotemporal person-specific features between the modalities. Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation.

TL;DR: LoRun introduces generalized Deep LoRA Unfolding Networks for image restoration, using lightweight LoRA adapters to adapt a shared base denoiser across stages, reducing parameter redundancy while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have limitations: (i) identical proximal mapping modules across stages ignore stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels, and (ii) repetitive block structures cause severe parameter redundancy and high memory consumption, hindering deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: LoRun introduces a novel paradigm where a single pretrained base denoiser is shared across all stages, while lightweight, stage-specific LoRA adapters are injected into the proximal mapping modules to dynamically modulate denoising behavior according to the noise level at each unfolding step.

Result: The method achieves up to N times parameter reduction for an N-stage DUN with on-par or better performance, validated through extensive experiments on three image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: LoRun harmonizes denoising objectives and adapts to different denoising levels between stages with compressed memory usage, enabling precise control over denoising intensity without duplicating full network parameters for more efficient deep unfolding networks.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs), combining conventional iterative optimization algorithms and deep neural networks into a multi-stage framework, have achieved remarkable accomplishments in Image Restoration (IR), such as spectral imaging reconstruction, compressive sensing and super-resolution.It unfolds the iterative optimization steps into a stack of sequentially linked blocks.Each block consists of a Gradient Descent Module (GDM) and a Proximal Mapping Module (PMM) which is equivalent to a denoiser from a Bayesian perspective, operating on Gaussian noise with a known level.However, existing DUNs suffer from two critical limitations: (i) their PMMs share identical architectures and denoising objectives across stages, ignoring the need for stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels; and (ii) their chain of structurally repetitive blocks results in severe parameter redundancy and high memory consumption, hindering deployment in large-scale or resource-constrained scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce generalized Deep Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) Unfolding Networks for image restoration, named LoRun, harmonizing denoising objectives and adapting different denoising levels between stages with compressed memory usage for more efficient DUN.LoRun introduces a novel paradigm where a single pretrained base denoiser is shared across all stages, while lightweight, stage-specific LoRA adapters are injected into the PMMs to dynamically modulate denoising behavior according to the noise level at each unfolding step.This design decouples the core restoration capability from task-specific adaptation, enabling precise control over denoising intensity without duplicating full network parameters and achieving up to $N$ times parameter reduction for an $N$-stage DUN with on-par or better performance.Extensive experiments conducted on three IR tasks validate the efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: Video-TwG: A curriculum reinforced framework for long video understanding that uses Think-with-Grounding paradigm to selectively zoom into relevant video clips during reasoning, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long video understanding use text-only reasoning with fixed video context, which exacerbates hallucinations because crucial details are often ignored due to temporal redundancy in long videos.

Method: Proposes Video-TwG with Think-with-Grounding paradigm that actively decides when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning. Uses Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy: first learns on small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels, then scales to diverse general QA data. Introduces TwG-GRPO algorithm with fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward, and accuracy-gated mechanism. Constructs TwG-51K dataset for training.

Result: Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines. Ablation studies validate necessity of Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and show TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.

Conclusion: Video-TwG effectively addresses hallucinations in long video understanding by enabling selective on-demand grounding during reasoning, with curriculum learning and reinforcement optimization improving both grounding quality and question answering accuracy.

Abstract: Long video understanding is challenging due to rich and complicated multimodal clues in long temporal range.Current methods adopt reasoning to improve the model's ability to analyze complex video clues in long videos via text-form reasoning.However,the existing literature suffers from the fact that the text-only reasoning under fixed video context may exacerbate hallucinations since detailed crucial clues are often ignored under limited video context length due to the temporal redundancy of long videos.To address this gap,we propose Video-TwG,a curriculum reinforced framework that employs a novel Think-with-Grounding paradigm,enabling video LLMs to actively decide when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning, selectively zooming into question-relevant clips only when necessary.Video-TwG can be trained end-to-end in a straightforward manner, without relying on complex auxiliary modules or heavily annotated reasoning tracesIn detail,we design a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy, where the model first learns think-with-grounding behavior on a small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels,and then scales to diverse general QA data with videos of diverse domains to encourage generalization. Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.

*Tingyang Xiao,Liu Liu,Wei Feng,Zhengyu Zou,Xiaolin Zhou,Wei Sui,Hao Li,Dingwen Zhang,Zhizhong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRIS-SLAM is a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that uses unified geometric-instance representations from an instance-extended foundation model to improve semantic understanding and loop closure capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometry foundation models lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure, while semantic mapping approaches suffer from decoupled architectures and fragile data association. There's a need to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping.

Method: Extends a geometry foundation model to predict both dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings. Uses semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection with viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

Conclusion: IRIS-SLAM effectively bridges geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping through unified geometric-instance representations, demonstrating superior performance in semantic SLAM tasks.

Abstract: Geometry foundation models have significantly advanced dense geometric SLAM, yet existing systems often lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure capabilities. Meanwhile, contemporary semantic mapping approaches are frequently hindered by decoupled architectures and fragile data association. We propose IRIS-SLAM, a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that leverages unified geometric-instance representations derived from an instance-extended foundation model. By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

*Ahmed Akl,Abdelwahed Khamis,Ali Cheraghian,Zhe Wang,Sara Khalifa,Kewen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIME: A training-free model editing approach that selectively modifies latent features in LVLMs to suppress object hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge, achieving 61.8% average reduction without extra parameters or computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination (describing non-existent objects or incorrect facts), raising reliability concerns. Fine-tuning is computationally expensive and difficult, motivating the need for training-free alternatives like model editing. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting valuable pre-trained knowledge.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis of LVLM decoders on Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna backbones to reveal layer-wise susceptibility to hallucination. 2) Introduced Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS) to quantify each layer's sensitivity. 3) Proposed HIME (Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing) - a layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features based on HIS guidance.

Result: HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks (CHAIR, MME, GPT-4V-aided evaluation). Achieves this without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.

Conclusion: HIME provides an effective training-free solution to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs through targeted layer-adaptive editing, balancing hallucination suppression with preservation of pre-trained knowledge. The HIS metric offers principled guidance for intervention at appropriate layers.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet they remain prone to object hallucination, where models describe non-existent objects or attribute incorrect factual information, raising serious concerns for reliable real-world deployment. While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.

TL;DR: NeXt2Former-CD: A ConvNeXt + deformable attention + Mask2Former framework for remote sensing change detection that outperforms recent Mamba-based SSMs while maintaining comparable inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While State Space Models (SSMs) have gained popularity in remote sensing change detection for their scaling properties, the authors explore modern convolutional and attention-based architectures as competitive alternatives to better handle co-registration noise, spatial shifts, and semantic ambiguity in bi-temporal imagery.

Method: Proposes NeXt2Former-CD: a Siamese ConvNeXt encoder initialized with DINOv3 weights for feature extraction, a deformable attention-based temporal fusion module to handle spatial misalignment, and a Mask2Former decoder for segmentation. The design specifically addresses residual co-registration noise and small object-level shifts.

Result: Achieves best results on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD datasets, outperforming recent Mamba-based baselines in both F1 score and IoU. Despite larger parameter count, maintains inference latency comparable to SSM-based approaches.

Conclusion: NeXt2Former-CD demonstrates that modern convolutional and attention-based architectures can be competitive alternatives to SSMs for remote sensing change detection, offering better performance while maintaining practical inference speeds for high-resolution tasks.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently gained traction in remote sensing change detection (CD) for their favorable scaling properties. In this paper, we explore the potential of modern convolutional and attention-based architectures as a competitive alternative. We propose NeXt2Former-CD, an end-to-end framework that integrates a Siamese ConvNeXt encoder initialized with DINOv3 weights, a deformable attention-based temporal fusion module, and a Mask2Former decoder. This design is intended to better tolerate residual co-registration noise and small object-level spatial shifts, as well as semantic ambiguity in bi-temporal imagery. Experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD datasets show that our method achieves the best results among the evaluated methods, improving over recent Mamba-based baselines in both F1 score and IoU. Furthermore, despite a larger parameter count, our model maintains inference latency comparable to SSM-based approaches, suggesting it is practical for high-resolution change detection tasks.

*Ganesh Samarth,Sibendu Paul,Solale Tabarestani,Caren Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMBlurDetect is a framework for detecting subtle motion blur in static images, combining high-quality dataset generation with an end-to-end detector that achieves strong zero-shot performance across multiple granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur in visual assets (thumbnails, box art, cover images) reduces visual clarity and negatively impacts user engagement metrics like click-through rates. Existing methods focus on severe blur and lack fine-grained pixel-level annotations needed for quality-critical applications in streaming services.

Method: Proposes SMBlurDetect with two components: 1) A pipeline that synthesizes realistic motion blur from high-resolution aesthetic images using controllable camera/object motion simulations over SAM-segmented regions with alpha-aware compositing, 2) A U-Net based detector with ImageNet pretrained encoders using hybrid mask/image centric strategy with curriculum learning, hard negatives, focal loss, blur frequency channels, and resolution-aware augmentation.

Result: Achieves 89.68% accuracy on GoPro (vs 66.50% baseline) and 59.77% Mean IoU on CUHK (vs 9.00% baseline), demonstrating 6.6x improvement in segmentation. Shows strong zero-shot generalization and accurate localization of subtle blur artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework enables automated filtering of low-quality frames and precise region-of-interest extraction for intelligent cropping in streaming services, addressing the previously underexplored problem of subtle motion blur detection from static images.

Abstract: Streaming services serve hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide, where visual assets such as thumbnails, box art, and cover images are critical for engagement. Subtle motion blur remains a pervasive quality issue, reducing visual clarity and negatively affecting user trust and click-through rates. However, motion blur detection from static images is underexplored, as existing methods and datasets focus on severe blur and lack fine-grained pixel-level annotations needed for quality-critical applications. Benchmarks such as GOPRO and NFS are dominated by strong synthetic blur and often contain residual blur in their sharp references, leading to ambiguous supervision. We propose SMBlurDetect, a unified framework combining high-quality motion blur specific dataset generation with an end-to-end detector capable of zero-shot detection at multiple granularities. Our pipeline synthesizes realistic motion blur from super high resolution aesthetic images using controllable camera and object motion simulations over SAM segmented regions, enhanced with alpha-aware compositing and balanced sampling to generate subtle, spatially localized blur with precise ground truth masks. We train a U-Net based detector with ImageNet pretrained encoders using a hybrid mask and image centric strategy incorporating curriculum learning, hard negatives, focal loss, blur frequency channels, and resolution aware augmentation.Our method achieves strong zero-shot generalization, reaching 89.68% accuracy on GoPro (vs 66.50% baseline) and 59.77% Mean IoU on CUHK (vs 9.00% baseline), demonstrating 6.6x improvement in segmentation. Qualitative results show accurate localization of subtle blur artifacts, enabling automated filtering of low quality frames and precise region of interest extraction for intelligent cropping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WiCompass is a coverage-aware data collection framework for mmWave human pose estimation that uses a motion-capture oracle to identify underrepresented motions and prioritize informative samples, improving OOD robustness more efficiently than brute-force scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave human pose estimation promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. Brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution robustness, with efficiency and coverage being the true bottlenecks.

Method: WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space "oracle" that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. It then uses a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples.

Result: WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies.

Conclusion: By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. We demonstrate that brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness; efficiency and coverage are the true bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiSCHiEF introduces two fine-grained image-caption alignment benchmarks (safety and culture domains) to evaluate VLMs on subtle visual-linguistic distinctions, revealing persistent modality misalignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with fine-grained image-caption alignment in socially critical contexts like safety and culture, where subtle misinterpretations can have significant real-world consequences. There's a need for benchmarks that test models' ability to distinguish minimally differing scenarios.

Method: Created MiSCHiEF: two benchmarking datasets (MiS for safety, MiC for culture) using contrastive pair design. Each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. Evaluated four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation between safe/unsafe scenarios and cultural contexts.

Result: Models perform better at confirming correct image-caption pairs than rejecting incorrect ones. Higher accuracy when selecting correct caption from similar captions for a given image vs. the converse task. Overall results show persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs.

Conclusion: VLMs face significant challenges in precise cross-modal grounding for applications requiring subtle semantic and visual distinctions. The MiSCHiEF benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle fine-grained alignment in socially critical domains.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts such as identifying real-world risk scenarios or distinguishing cultural proxies, where correct interpretation hinges on subtle visual or linguistic clues and where minor misinterpretations can lead to significant real-world consequences. We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task. The results, overall, highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with complex geometric reasoning due to limited training data and weak alignment between visual diagrams and symbolic reasoning, creating a need for better multimodal geometry datasets.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) symbolic seed construction, 2) grounded instantiation with verification, 3) code-based diagram rendering. Uses code prediction as explicit alignment objective to transform visual understanding into structured prediction.

Result: GeoCode dataset has substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks while maintaining mathematical correctness. Models trained on GeoCode achieve consistent improvements on multiple geometry benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset generation pipeline and code-based alignment strategy effectively address multimodal geometry reasoning challenges, demonstrating both the value of the GeoCode dataset and the effectiveness of the visual-symbolic alignment approach.

Abstract: Multimodal geometry reasoning requires models to jointly understand visual diagrams and perform structured symbolic inference, yet current vision--language models struggle with complex geometric constructions due to limited training data and weak visual--symbolic alignment. We propose a pipeline for synthesizing complex multimodal geometry problems from scratch and construct a dataset named \textbf{GeoCode}, which decouples problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering, ensuring consistency across structure, text, reasoning, and images. Leveraging the plotting code provided in GeoCode, we further introduce code prediction as an explicit alignment objective, transforming visual understanding into a supervised structured prediction task. GeoCode exhibits substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks, while maintaining mathematical correctness through multi-stage validation. Extensive experiments show that models trained on GeoCode achieve consistent improvements on multiple geometry benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the proposed alignment strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRROR is a framework that enhances multimodal reasoning in VLMs through iterative visual reflection, using region-based verification to ground answers in visual evidence and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs often produce plausible but ungrounded answers with hallucinations or logic errors when handling ambiguous/complex visual inputs. Even when prompted to reflect, their corrections remain detached from image evidence.

Method: Proposes MIRROR framework with closed-loop process: draft → critique → region-based verification → revision, repeated until output is visually grounded. Trained on ReflectV dataset containing reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and evidence-grounded answer revisions.

Result: Experiments on general vision-language benchmarks and vision-language reasoning benchmarks show MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating value of training reflection as evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process.

Conclusion: Visual reflection as a core mechanism with region-based verification is effective for grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence, addressing the critical challenge of hallucinations in VLMs handling complex visual inputs.

Abstract: In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking 10 foundation models for histopathology segmentation shows CONCH (vision-language) performs best, with PathDino as runner-up. Ensemble features from multiple models improve performance by 7.95% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like CLIP, DINO, and CONCH show strong domain generalization but lack systematic evaluation for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology. There's a need for robust benchmarking to assess their performance on tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed a benchmarking approach using attention maps from foundation models as pixel-wise features, classified with XGBoost. Evaluated 10 foundation models on four histopathological datasets without fine-tuning, enabling fast, interpretable, model-agnostic evaluation.

Result: CONCH (vision-language model) performed best across datasets, with PathDino as close second. Models trained on different histopathology cohorts capture complementary representations. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models by 7.95% averaged across datasets.

Conclusion: Ensembles of foundation models with complementary representations generalize better to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks. Vision-language models like CONCH show superior performance, and feature concatenation from multiple specialized models significantly improves segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models such as CLIP, DINO,and CONCH have demonstrated remarkable domain generalization and unsupervised feature extraction capabilities across diverse imaging tasks. However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal editing models suffer from facial identity inconsistency during portrait editing, which hinders practical deployment due to human eye sensitivity to facial features. Existing methods struggle with cross-source distribution bias and feature contamination.

Method: Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework with three components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy for cross-source latent alignment, 2) Hybrid solver for disentangling source-specific identity attributes, 3) Attentional gating mechanism for selective visual element entanglement.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial identity and edited element consistency. Training-free, plug-and-play solution that establishes new benchmark for single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings.

Conclusion: EditedID enables practical deployment of multimodal editing models in real-person editing scenarios by solving facial identity inconsistency through systematic analysis of diffusion trajectories and attention properties.

Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Motivation: Current E2E-AD systems learn only average driving styles, ignoring individual differences. Three key challenges exist: limited personalized datasets, lack of quantitative style evaluation metrics, and absence of algorithms for learning stylized representations from user trajectories.

Method: 1) Open-source data collection system simulating realistic scenarios for scalable personalized datasets; 2) Style vector-based evaluation metrics using Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence; 3) Personalized E2E-AD framework with style reward model for adapting models to individual driving styles.

Conclusion: Person2Drive provides a comprehensive solution for personalized autonomous driving, offering tools for data collection, style evaluation, and algorithm adaptation. The dataset and code will be publicly released after acceptance.

Abstract: Human driving behavior is inherently diverse, yet most end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems learn a single average driving style, neglecting individual differences. Achieving personalized E2E-AD faces challenges across three levels: limited real-world datasets with individual-level annotations, a lack of quantitative metrics for evaluating personal driving styles, and the absence of algorithms that can learn stylized representations from users' trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Person2Drive enables fine-grained analysis, reproducible evaluation, and effective personalization in end-to-end autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for FER produce ungrounded, unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across datasets.

Method: TAG constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs), requiring intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions. Training involves supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors.

Result: TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation studies show AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination.

Conclusion: Structured grounded intermediate representations (via Action Units) are crucial for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER, enabling verifiable visual evidence and reducing hallucination.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a fine-grained visual understanding task where reliable predictions require reasoning over localized and meaningful facial cues. Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER.

TL;DR: GeoLink-UV is a nationwide urban village mapping dataset for 342 Chinese cities, created using foundation model-driven framework to address generalization issues, revealing significant regional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban villages are important informal settlements in China's urbanization, but lack of consistent nationwide dataset hinders urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development planning. The heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory has prevented reliable nationwide mapping.

Method: Used multisource geospatial data (optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data) with a foundation model-driven mapping framework to address generalization issues and improve product quality. Conducted geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities.

Result: Created high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product covering 342 Chinese cities. UV areas account for 8% of built-up land on average, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis shows consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern nationwide with regionally differentiated morphological characteristics.

Conclusion: GeoLink-UV provides an open, systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning. It contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11 and addresses the critical need for reliable nationwide UV data.

Abstract: Urban Villages (UVs) represent a distinctive form of high-density informal settlement embedded within China's rapidly urbanizing cities. Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11. The GeoLink-UV dataset introduced in this article is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18688062.

*Pablo Meseguer,Rocío del Amor,Valery Naranjo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZS-MIL uses VLM text encoder embeddings as classifier initialization for MIL-based WSI classification, outperforming random initialization in few-shot learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random classifier initialization in MIL frameworks for WSI classification often underperforms zero-shot prediction, especially in few-shot learning scenarios where weight initialization significantly impacts performance.

Method: Proposes Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) that uses class-level embeddings from VLM text encoders as starting point for classification layer weights, enabling computation of bag-level probabilities for WSI classification.

Result: ZS-MIL demonstrates robustness compared to standard weight initialization techniques in terms of both performance and variability in efficient transfer learning few-shot scenarios for subtyping prediction.

Conclusion: Using VLM text encoder embeddings for classifier initialization in MIL frameworks improves few-shot learning performance for WSI classification, addressing limitations of random initialization.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) pre-trained on datasets of histopathological image-caption pairs enabled zero-shot slide-level classification. The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction.

### [40] [Rethinking Preference Alignment for Diffusion Models with Classifier-Free Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18799)
*Zhou Jiang,Yandong Wen,Zhen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time guidance method for aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences without retraining the base model, using contrastive guidance from separate positive/negative preference modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences is challenging. Direct preference optimization (DPO) shows generalization gaps when scaled, and there's a need for methods that improve alignment without expensive retraining of base models.

Method: The method treats preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG) where a finetuned preference model acts as external control during sampling. It decouples preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data separately, then forms a contrastive guidance vector (positive minus negative predictions) that is scaled by user-chosen strength and added to base predictions at each sampling step.

Result: The method shows consistent quantitative and qualitative gains when evaluated on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3 datasets, demonstrating improved alignment without retraining base models.

Conclusion: The proposed contrastive guidance approach provides a simple, effective way to align diffusion models with human preferences at inference time, offering sharper and controllable alignment signals while avoiding the generalization issues of large-scale finetuning.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences remains challenging. While direct preference optimization (DPO) is simple and effective, large-scale finetuning often shows a generalization gap. We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains.

*Wanqi Wang,Jingcai Guo,Yuxiang Cai,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMP: A dual-branch detector that learns multi-modal prototypes by combining textual guidance with visual exemplars for cross-domain few-shot object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary detectors rely heavily on text prompts which capture domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization in few-shot scenarios.

Method: Proposes LMP with dual branches: 1) Visual-guided branch that constructs class-level prototypes from support RoIs and generates hard-negative prototypes via jittered boxes, injecting them into detection pipeline; 2) Text-guided branch preserving open-vocabulary semantics. Both branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP on six cross-domain benchmark datasets across standard 1/5/10-shot settings.

Conclusion: LMP effectively combines semantic abstraction from text with domain-adaptive visual details, enabling superior cross-domain few-shot object detection by learning multi-modal prototypes.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples. While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.

*Chongyang Xu,Shen Cheng,Haipeng Li,Haoqiang Fan,Ziliang Feng,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeRO is a diffusion-based policy for robotic manipulation that combines geometry and semantics through hierarchical semantic fields, achieving state-of-the-art performance on pose-aware manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D geometric policies for robotic manipulation lack explicit part-level semantics, which are crucial for pose-aware manipulation tasks like distinguishing different parts of objects (e.g., shoe toe vs heel).

Method: HeRO uses dense semantics lifting to fuse DINOv2's geometry-sensitive features with Stable Diffusion's coherent correspondences, creating dense features processed into global and local fields. A hierarchical conditioning module with permutation-invariant architecture conditions the diffusion denoiser on these fields.

Result: HeRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving success on Place Dual Shoes by 12.3% and averaging 6.5% gains across six challenging pose-aware manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The hierarchical semantic field approach effectively couples geometry and semantics for pose-aware robotic manipulation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation has progressed from 2D image policies to 3D representations that explicitly encode geometry. Yet purely geometric policies often lack explicit part-level semantics, which are critical for pose-aware manipulation (e.g., distinguishing a shoe's toe from heel). In this paper, we present HeRO, a diffusion-based policy that couples geometry and semantics via hierarchical semantic fields. HeRO employs dense semantics lifting to fuse discriminative, geometry-sensitive features from DINOv2 with the smooth, globally coherent correspondences from Stable Diffusion, yielding dense features that are both fine-grained and spatially consistent. These features are processed and partitioned to construct a global field and a set of local fields. A hierarchical conditioning module conditions the generative denoiser on global and local fields using permutation-invariant network architecture, thereby avoiding order-sensitive bias and producing a coherent control policy for pose-aware manipulation. In various tests, HeRO establishes a new state-of-the-art, improving success on Place Dual Shoes by 12.3% and averaging 6.5% gains across six challenging pose-aware tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobSelf is a fully self-supervised model for cross-modal super-resolution on real-world misaligned data that requires no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment, achieving SOTA performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of cross-modal super-resolution on real-world misaligned data where only limited LR source and HR guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available, without requiring training data or ground-truth supervision.

Method: Proposes RobSelf with two key techniques: 1) misalignment-aware feature translator that reformulates unsupervised cross-modal alignment as a weakly-supervised translation subtask, and 2) content-aware reference filter that performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source for SR predictions.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency across various tasks, and introduces a new real-world dataset RealMisSR to advance research in this area.

Conclusion: RobSelf provides an effective self-supervised solution for cross-modal super-resolution on misaligned real-world data, achieving high performance without requiring training data or supervision, with potential applications in various domains.

Abstract: We study cross-modal super-resolution (SR) on real-world misaligned data, where only a limited number of low-resolution (LR) source and high-resolution (HR) guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available. To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSTAR: A spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model for generating high-quality, consistent 4D objects by leveraging historical timestep information and encoding 4D structure into discrete tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency in 4D object generation because they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide current generation, leading to inconsistent results.

Method: Two key components: (1) Dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) that divides prediction tokens into timestep groups, propagates spatial-temporal states from previous groups, and uses a spatial-temporal container to update features from all historical groups to guide next token group prediction. (2) 4D VQ-VAE that encodes 4D structure into discrete space and decodes predicted tokens into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians.

Result: 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models, demonstrating improved consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed 4DSTAR framework effectively addresses spatial-temporal inconsistency in 4D object generation by leveraging historical information through state propagation and discrete token representation, offering a competitive alternative to diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D objects with spatial-temporal consistency is still formidable. Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.

*Fadi Boutros,Eduarda Caldeira,Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDPERTURB is a geometric sampling method that perturbs identity embeddings to generate diverse synthetic face images for training better face recognition systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic face data is needed due to privacy/legal restrictions on real biometric data, but current identity-conditional diffusion models lack sufficient intra-class variation needed for robust face recognition training.

Method: IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region on the unit hyper-sphere, creating diverse embeddings that serve as conditioning vectors for pre-trained diffusion models to generate varied yet identity-consistent face images.

Result: Training face recognition systems on datasets generated with IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.

Conclusion: IDPERTURB provides an effective, model-agnostic way to enhance synthetic face diversity, enabling better training of generalizable face recognition systems without modifying underlying generative models.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a practical alternative to authentic face datasets for training face recognition (FR) systems, especially as privacy and legal concerns increasingly restrict the use of real biometric data. Recent advances in identity-conditional diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic and identity-consistent face images. However, many of these models suffer from limited intra-class variation, an essential property for training robust and generalizable FR models. In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes CLAP, a lightweight convolutional autoencoder for plant disease classification using separable convolutions and sigmoid gating, achieving competitive accuracy with low computational cost (5M parameters, 1ms inference).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN models struggle with subtle variations in plant disease classification under realistic field conditions, and existing deep learning methods are often computationally intensive with additional preprocessing requirements.

Method: Lightweight autoencoder with separable convolutional layers in encoder-decoder blocks, sigmoid gating for feature discriminability refinement, and feature map combination from encoder-decoder for rich representation before classification.

Result: Improved or competitive accuracies on three public plant datasets (Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, CCMT) with 5 million parameters, 20ms training time, and 1ms inference time per image.

Conclusion: CLAP effectively balances performance and computational efficiency for plant disease classification, making it suitable for realistic field applications with limited resources.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have remarkably progressed the performance of distinguishing plant diseases, severity grading, and nutrition deficiency prediction using leaf images. However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IFA-Net is a novel image forgery detection method that uses a frozen Masked Autoencoder as a universal realness prior to localize manipulated regions by detecting deviations from natural image patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detection methods struggle with novel manipulations as they learn specific forgery patterns rather than modeling natural image characteristics. The proliferation of realistic AI-generated images requires more robust approaches that can generalize to evolving editing techniques.

Method: IFA-Net uses a frozen MAE pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. It employs a two-stage closed-loop process: 1) Dual-Stream Segmentation Network fuses original images with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, 2) Task-Adaptive Prior Injection converts coarse predictions into prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show IFA-Net achieves average improvements of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types.

Conclusion: By shifting from learning "what is fake" to modeling "what is real", IFA-Net provides a more robust approach to forgery detection that leverages natural image manifold deviations, achieving superior performance and generalization capabilities for pixel-level manipulation localization.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images poses critical challenges for digital forensics, demanding precise pixel-level localization of manipulated regions. Existing methods predominantly learn discriminative patterns of specific forgeries and often struggle with novel manipulations as editing techniques continue to evolve. We propose the Iterative Forgery Amplifier Network (IFA-Net), which shifts from learning "what is fake" to modeling "what is real". Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types.

TL;DR: A framework for generating copyright triggers in multimodal LLMs to embed verifiable ownership information that only activates in derivative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With widespread adoption of MLLMs, disputes over model version attribution and ownership are increasing, creating need for intellectual property protection mechanisms.

Method: Dual-injection approach: 1) Textual consistency loss between auxiliary MLLM output and target ownership text, 2) Semantic-level CLIP feature alignment between image and text. Additional adversarial training with auxiliary model trained to resist ownership responses.

Result: Effective tracking of model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios through the dual-injection copyright trigger framework.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully embeds verifiable ownership information in MLLMs, enabling copyright protection by creating triggers that only activate in derivative models.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment and widespread adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), disputes regarding model version attribution and ownership have become increasingly frequent, raising significant concerns about intellectual property protection. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.

TL;DR: DUET-VLM is a dual compression framework that reduces visual tokens in VLMs while maintaining accuracy through vision-only redundancy-aware compression and text-guided token dropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization, and existing efficiency approaches often trade accuracy for speed by merging or dropping tokens.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) vision-only redundancy-aware compression of vision encoder output into information-preserving tokens, (2) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens.

Result: On LLaVA-1.5-7B: maintains >99% baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, >97% at 89% reduction. With training: 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89% reduction. On Video-LLaVA-7B: surpasses baseline with >100% accuracy at 53.1% reduction, 97.6% accuracy at 93.4% reduction.

Conclusion: DUET-VLM enables aggressive visual token compression while retaining critical semantics, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and allowing robust adaptation to reduced visual input without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities, yet remain computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization. Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains >97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving >100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting. These results highlight end-to-end training with DUET-VLM, enabling robust adaptation to reduced visual (image/video) input without sacrificing accuracy, producing compact yet semantically rich representations within the same computational budget.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that addresses both unseen domains and unseen categories in semantic segmentation, with a focus on autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain generalization methods are limited to fixed categories, while open-vocabulary segmentation models struggle with domain shifts. There's a need to handle both unseen domains and unseen categories simultaneously, especially in urban-driving scenarios.

Method: Proposes S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions in pre-trained vision-language models to produce more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes.

Result: Extensive experiments on the constructed benchmark show superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the OVDG-SS benchmark for autonomous driving and demonstrates that addressing domain-induced distortions in text-image correlations improves robustness to both unseen domains and unseen categories.

Abstract: Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) aims to enable segmentation models to perform robustly in unseen environments. However, conventional DG-SS methods are restricted to a fixed set of known categories, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) by enabling models to recognize a broader range of concepts. Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches.

TL;DR: A framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers that achieves state-of-the-art low-bit accuracy on ImageNet with efficient data-free calibration using Stable Diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for Vision Transformers either use post-training or block-wise reconstruction approaches, which don't fully optimize inter-block dependencies. There's a need for more efficient joint quantization methods that work well under extremely low-bit settings for edge deployment.

Method: End-to-end joint optimization over all layers and inter-block dependencies without labeled data, using a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse samples via Stable Diffusion Turbo with learned multi-mode prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet, and first PTQ results maintaining strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8). Data-free approach matches real-data ImageNet calibration performance.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient joint quantization of Vision Transformers for edge deployment, with fast optimization (1 hour on single GPU) and effective data-free calibration using learned prompts with Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: We present a framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers trained on ImageNet for the purpose of image classification. Unlike prior post-training or block-wise reconstruction methods, we jointly optimize over the entire set of all layers and inter-block dependencies without any labeled data, scaling effectively with the number of samples and completing in just one hour on a single GPU for ViT-small. We achieve state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and, to the best of our knowledge, the first PTQ results that maintain strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8), demonstrating the potential for efficient edge deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as "a <adjective> photo of <adjective> <cls>".

### [52] [Similarity-as-Evidence: Calibrating Overconfident VLMs for Interpretable and Label-Efficient Medical Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18867)
*Zhuofan Xie,Zishan Lin,Jinliang Lin,Jie Qi,Shaohua Hong,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaE framework calibrates vision-language model similarities as evidence using Dirichlet distributions to mitigate overconfidence, enabling better active learning sample selection in medical imaging with interpretable acquisition strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning suffers from cold-start problems with scarce labeled data, while vision-language models' softmax outputs treat text-image similarities as deterministic scores ignoring uncertainty, leading to overconfidence that wastes annotation budgets on uninformative samples.

Method: Introduces Similarity-as-Evidence (SaE) framework with Similarity Evidence Head (SEH) that reinterprets similarity vectors as evidence, parameterizing a Dirichlet distribution over labels to quantify uncertainty (vacuity and dissonance). Uses dual-factor acquisition: high-vacuity samples prioritized early for coverage, high-dissonance samples prioritized later for boundary refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art macro-averaged accuracy of 82.57% across ten medical imaging datasets with 20% label budget. On BTMRI dataset, achieves superior calibration with negative log-likelihood of 0.425.

Conclusion: SaE effectively addresses cold-start and overconfidence problems in medical imaging active learning by calibrating vision-language model similarities as evidence, providing interpretable sample selection strategies that improve both accuracy and calibration.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by selecting only the most informative samples for labeling, but suffers from cold-start when labeled data are scarce. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) address the cold-start problem via zero-shot predictions, yet their temperature-scaled softmax outputs treat text-image similarities as deterministic scores while ignoring inherent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence misleads sample selection, wasting annotation budgets on uninformative cases. To overcome these limitations, the Similarity-as-Evidence (SaE) framework calibrates text-image similarities by introducing a Similarity Evidence Head (SEH), which reinterprets the similarity vector as evidence and parameterizes a Dirichlet distribution over labels. In contrast to a standard softmax that enforces confident predictions even under weak signals, the Dirichlet formulation explicitly quantifies lack of evidence (vacuity) and conflicting evidence (dissonance), thereby mitigating overconfidence caused by rigid softmax normalization. Building on this, SaE employs a dual-factor acquisition strategy: high-vacuity samples (e.g., rare diseases) are prioritized in early rounds to ensure coverage, while high-dissonance samples (e.g., ambiguous diagnoses) are prioritized later to refine boundaries, providing clinically interpretable selection rationales. Experiments on ten public medical imaging datasets with a 20% label budget show that SaE attains state-of-the-art macro-averaged accuracy of 82.57%. On the representative BTMRI dataset, SaE also achieves superior calibration, with a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of 0.425.

### [53] [Enhancing 3D LiDAR Segmentation by Shaping Dense and Accurate 2D Semantic Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18869)
*Xiaoyu Dong,Tiankui Xian,Wanshui Gan,Naoto Yokoya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM2D3D improves 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by enhancing sparse 2D projections using camera images through cross-modal guided filtering and dynamic cross pseudo supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Projecting 3D LiDAR point clouds to 2D creates sparse maps that lead to inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in turn limits final 3D segmentation accuracy.

Method: Multi-modal segmentation model (MM2D3D) uses camera images as auxiliary data with two key techniques: 1) Cross-modal guided filtering to constrain 2D predictions with dense semantic relations from images, and 2) Dynamic cross pseudo supervision to encourage 2D predictions to emulate dense distribution from image-based semantic predictions.

Result: The model achieves dense and accurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which effectively enhances final 3D accuracy. Outperforms previous methods in both 2D and 3D spaces.

Conclusion: Using camera images to address sparsity in projected LiDAR maps enables more accurate 2D semantic predictions that significantly improve 3D LiDAR point cloud segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is important in urban remote sensing for understanding real-world street environments. This task, by projecting LiDAR point clouds and 3D semantic labels as sparse maps, can be reformulated as a 2D problem. However, the intrinsic sparsity of the projected LiDAR and label maps can result in sparse and inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in return limits the final 3D accuracy. To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our superior performance in both 2D and 3D spaces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiMotion: A feed-forward framework for text-guided 3D character motion generation using continuous B-spline representations to overcome limitations of fixed-length inputs and discrete frame-wise representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion methods produce limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics.

Method: Represents motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves using a closed-form Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver to compress variable-length sequences into compact representations. Includes normal-fusion strategy for shape adherence, correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion restoration quality.

Result: BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than state-of-the-art methods while achieving faster generation. Evaluated on BIMO dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich text annotations.

Conclusion: Continuous B-spline representations enable effective motion generation without modifying underlying generative model capabilities, addressing limitations of existing methods and producing superior motion quality and alignment with textual descriptions.

Abstract: Text-guided dynamic 3D character generation has advanced rapidly, yet producing high-quality motion that faithfully reflects rich textual descriptions remains challenging. Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

*Jie Li,Suorong Yang,Jian Zhao,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLD-Font is a diffusion model for few-shot Chinese font generation that achieves structure-level disentanglement between content and style using separate channels, outperforming existing methods in style fidelity while maintaining content accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot Chinese font generation methods only achieve feature-level disentanglement, allowing generators to re-entangle content and style features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. There's a need for better disentanglement to preserve both content accuracy and style faithfulness.

Method: Proposes Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font) with: 1) Separate content and style channels (SimSun-style content templates + CLIP-extracted style features via cross-attention), 2) Background Noise Removal module for complex stroke regions, 3) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy updating only style-related modules, and 4) Theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness.

Result: SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Introduces Grey and OCR metrics for content quality evaluation, showing superior performance in few-shot Chinese font generation.

Conclusion: Structure-level disentanglement through separate content/style channels and parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables better adaptation to new styles while avoiding content overfitting, advancing few-shot Chinese font generation with improved style fidelity and content preservation.

Abstract: Few-shot Chinese font generation aims to synthesize new characters in a target style using only a handful of reference images. Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCA is a multimodal LLM framework for image forgery detection that combines RGB spatial and frequency domain features with cross-attention fusion for better detection and interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in image tampering techniques, especially generative models, threaten media verification and public trust. Existing methods rely too much on semantic content while ignoring textural cues, and lack interpretability for subtle tampering traces.

Method: FOCA integrates discriminative features from both RGB spatial and frequency domains using a cross-attention fusion module within a multimodal large language model framework. Also introduces FSE-Set dataset with diverse authentic/tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection performance and interpretability across spatial and frequency domains.

Conclusion: FOCA addresses key limitations of existing IFDL methods by combining spatial and frequency domain analysis with interpretable cross-domain explanations, advancing image forgery detection capabilities.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering techniques, particularly generative models, pose significant challenges to media verification, digital forensics, and public trust. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on semantic content while neglecting textural cues, and limited interpretability of subtle low-level tampering traces. To address these issues, we propose FOCA, a multimodal large language model-based framework that integrates discriminative features from both the RGB spatial and frequency domains via a cross-attention fusion module. This design enables accurate forgery detection and localization while providing explicit, human-interpretable cross-domain explanations. We further introduce FSE-Set, a large-scale dataset with diverse authentic and tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations. Extensive experiments show that FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance and interpretability across both spatial and frequency domains.

*Mohammad Asim,Christopher Wewer,Jan Eric Lenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTok is a novel tokenizer that encodes multi-view scenes into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens for efficient compression and diffusion-based generation, achieving 1-3 orders of magnitude better compression than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene representation and generation methods rely on 3D data structures or view-aligned fields, which lack efficient compression and disentanglement from spatial grids. There's a need for a more compressed, diffusable representation that enables efficient scene generation.

Method: SceneTok uses a multi-view tokenizer to encode scene information from many context views into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens disentangled from spatial grids. A light-weight rectified flow decoder then renders novel views from these tokens.

Result: Achieves 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger compression than other representations while maintaining state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Enables novel view rendering from deviating trajectories, handles uncertainty gracefully, and allows scene generation in 5 seconds with better quality-speed trade-off.

Conclusion: SceneTok introduces a novel token-based representation for 3D scenes that enables unprecedented compression, efficient diffusion-based generation, and flexible novel view synthesis, representing a significant advancement in 3D scene representation paradigms.

Abstract: We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While end-to-end autonomous driving systems offer unified modeling and scalability, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge in these unified frameworks. Current approaches lack explicit and interpretable safety reasoning capabilities.

Method: SafeDrive uses two complementary networks: 1) Sparse World Network (SWNet) constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds simulating future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, and 2) Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet) evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions to identify safety-critical events.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on both open-loop (NAVSIM: PDMS 91.6, EPDMS 87.5, only 0.5% collisions) and closed-loop (Bench2Drive: 66.8% driving score) benchmarks, demonstrating superior safety and performance.

Conclusion: SafeDrive successfully addresses the safety challenge in end-to-end autonomous driving by providing explicit, interpretable safety reasoning through trajectory-conditioned sparse world modeling, achieving both high performance and strong safety metrics.

Abstract: The end-to-end (E2E) paradigm, which maps sensor inputs directly to driving decisions, has recently attracted significant attention due to its unified modeling capability and scalability. However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector Quantization suffers from codebook collapse where many code vectors remain unused during training, limiting the effectiveness of VQ-based generative models like VQ-VAE, VQ-GAN, and latent diffusion models.

Method: Two new methods: 1) Non-Stationary Vector Quantization (NSVQ) propagates encoder drift to non-selected codes via kernel-based rule, 2) Transformer-based Vector Quantization (TransVQ) uses lightweight mapping to adaptively transform entire codebook while preserving convergence to k-means solution.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ show both methods achieve near-complete codebook utilization and superior reconstruction quality compared to baseline VQ variants.

Conclusion: The methods provide principled and scalable solutions to codebook collapse, offering a better foundation for future VQ-based generative models.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) underpins many modern generative frameworks such as VQ-VAE, VQ-GAN, and latent diffusion models. Yet, it suffers from the persistent problem of codebook collapse, where a large fraction of code vectors remains unused during training. This work provides a new theoretical explanation by identifying the nonstationary nature of encoder updates as the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. We show that as the encoder drifts, unselected code vectors fail to receive updates and gradually become inactive. To address this, we propose two new methods: Non-Stationary Vector Quantization (NSVQ), which propagates encoder drift to non-selected codes through a kernel-based rule, and Transformer-based Vector Quantization (TransVQ), which employs a lightweight mapping to adaptively transform the entire codebook while preserving convergence to the k-means solution. Experiments on the CelebA-HQ dataset demonstrate that both methods achieve near-complete codebook utilization and superior reconstruction quality compared to baseline VQ variants, providing a principled and scalable foundation for future VQ-based generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep learning enables accurate monocular depth estimation (MDE), integrating it into Structure-from-Motion (SfM) remains challenging due to MDE's dense depth maps with high error variance compared to conventional sparse triangulated points.

Method: Proposes Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA), inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, to mitigate MDE error variance by leveraging its density through marginalization techniques.

Result: MBA demonstrates that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield state-of-the-art or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks, with robust performance across varying scales from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images.

Conclusion: The method highlights the significant potential of monocular depth estimation in multi-view 3D vision, successfully bridging the gap between single-image depth prediction and multi-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a fundamental 3D vision task for recovering camera parameters and scene geometry from multi-view images. While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate consistently robust performance across varying scales, ranging from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images. Our method highlights the significant potential of MDE in multi-view 3D vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA combination techniques for personalized image generation face three main challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling element influence, and unstable weight fusion that often requires additional training.

Method: CRAFT-LoRA introduces three complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach with expert encoder and specialized branches for semantic extension and selective adapter aggregation; (3) training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that adjusts noise predictions across diffusion steps for stability.

Result: The method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.

Conclusion: CRAFT-LoRA effectively addresses the limitations of existing LoRA combination techniques by providing better content-style separation, precise control mechanisms, and stable fusion without requiring retraining, advancing personalized image generation capabilities.

Abstract: Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either use multiple agents (high coordination costs) or single agents (overloaded with both planning and perception), leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon navigation tasks.

Method: DACo employs a two-component architecture: a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observation and fine-grained execution. It integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning for structured, resilient navigation.

Result: Achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over best-performing baselines on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R benchmarks in zero-shot settings. Generalizes effectively across both closed-source (GPT-4o) and open-source (Qwen-VL Series) backbones.

Conclusion: DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation by disentangling global reasoning from local action, alleviating cognitive overload and improving stability.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Scene navigation is a fundamental capability for embodied human-AI collaboration, requiring agents to follow natural language instructions to execute coherent action sequences in complex environments. Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation. Project page: https://github.com/ChocoWu/DACo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frame2Freq introduces frequency-aware adapters using FFT for image-to-video adaptation, improving fine-grained action recognition by capturing multi-scale temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-domain adapters for video adaptation focus on static cues and fast flicker changes while missing medium-speed motion, which is crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis like distinguishing similar actions.

Method: Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform along the time dimension and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges for fine-grained action recognition.

Result: Outperforms prior PEFT methods on five fine-grained activity recognition datasets and surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them.

Conclusion: Frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer, providing effective adaptation of Vision Foundation Models to video tasks.

Abstract: Adapting image-pretrained backbones to video typically relies on time-domain adapters tuned to a single temporal scale. Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).
  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDSelect is a reinforcement learning-based selector that dynamically chooses optimal pre-trained models per modality per video sequence to balance accuracy and computational efficiency in video person recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based person recognition systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity, leading to inefficient resource usage.

Method: IDSelect uses a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector with actor-critic training and budget-aware optimization. A lightweight agent selects one pre-trained model per modality per sequence, balancing recognition accuracy with computational cost using entropy regularization to prevent premature convergence.

Result: On CCVID dataset: achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%. On MEVID dataset: reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: IDSelect demonstrates that input-conditioned selectors can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources, offering superior efficiency for video-based person recognition.

Abstract: Video-based person recognition achieves robust identification by integrating face, body, and gait. However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.

*Qingwen Zhang,Chenhan Jiang,Xiaomeng Zhu,Yunqi Miao,Yushan Zhang,Olov Andersson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy for multi-frame supervision in self-supervised scene flow estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 150x speedup over optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised feed-forward scene flow methods rely on two-frame point correspondences, which are unreliable under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision could provide more stable guidance, but naive extensions fail due to abrupt correspondence changes across frames.

Method: TeFlow uses temporal ensembling to mine consistent supervision by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames, enabling effective multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models.

Result: TeFlow achieves up to 33% performance gains on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods and performing on par with leading optimization-based methods while being 150x faster.

Conclusion: TeFlow successfully enables multi-frame supervision for feed-forward scene flow estimation through temporal consistency mining, offering both superior accuracy and real-time efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Self-supervised feed-forward methods for scene flow estimation offer real-time efficiency, but their supervision from two-frame point correspondences is unreliable and often breaks down under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision has the potential to provide more stable guidance by incorporating motion cues from past frames, yet naive extensions of two-frame objectives are ineffective because point correspondences vary abruptly across frames, producing inconsistent signals. In the paper, we present TeFlow, enabling multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models by mining temporally consistent supervision. TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy that forms reliable supervisory signals by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TeFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods, achieving performance gains of up to 33\% on the challenging Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets. Our method performs on par with leading optimization-based methods, yet speeds up 150 times. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow along with trained model weights.

*Jiwoo Chung,Sangeek Hyun,MinKyu Lee,Byeongju Han,Geonho Cha,Dongyoon Wee,Youngjun Hong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeaCache is a training-free caching method for diffusion models that uses spectral-evolution-aware filtering to make better reuse decisions, achieving state-of-the-art speed-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are powerful for visual generation but suffer from slow inference due to sequential denoising. Existing caching methods use raw feature differences that mix content and noise, ignoring the spectral evolution where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail refines later.

Method: SeaCache introduces a training-free cache schedule using spectrally aligned representations. It employs a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise, using SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy and create dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting diffusion model spectral priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: SeaCache provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating diffusion model inference by leveraging spectral evolution principles, offering better cache reuse decisions through noise-suppressed, content-preserving feature representations.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

### [70] [BayesFusion-SDF: Probabilistic Signed Distance Fusion with View Planning on CPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19697)
*Soumya Mazumdar,Vineet Kumar Rakesh,Tapas Samanta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesFusion-SDF is a CPU-based probabilistic 3D reconstruction framework that fuses depth observations using Bayesian inference on a sparse Gaussian random field, providing both geometry reconstruction and uncertainty estimates for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TSDF methods rely on heuristic weighting and lack systematic uncertainty quantification, while neural implicit methods require heavy GPU resources and lack interpretability for decision-making. There's a need for a transparent, probabilistic approach that works efficiently on CPU.

Method: 1. Use rough TSDF reconstruction to create adaptive narrow-band domain. 2. Fuse depth observations using heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation solved with sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. 3. Use randomized diagonal estimators for fast posterior uncertainty approximation.

Result: Outperforms TSDF baselines in geometric accuracy on controlled ablation scene and CO3D object sequence. Provides useful uncertainty estimates for surface extraction and next-best-view planning in active sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: BayesFusion-SDF offers a transparent, interpretable alternative to GPU-heavy neural methods with probabilistic reasoning capabilities, enabling uncertainty-aware surface reconstruction and active sensing on CPU hardware.

Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of establishing object-level visual correspondence between different viewpoints (egocentric-to-exocentric and vice versa) in videos, which is important for understanding object relationships across perspectives.

Method: Proposes a conditional binary segmentation framework where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide object localization in target videos. Introduces a cycle-consistency training objective where predicted masks in target views are projected back to source views to reconstruct original query masks, enabling self-supervised learning without ground-truth annotations. Also enables test-time training (TTT) at inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of the optimization objective and TTT strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with cycle-consistency training and test-time optimization effectively solves cross-view object correspondence in videos, providing a robust, view-invariant representation learning approach that works well in challenging egocentric-exocentric scenarios.

Abstract: We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Pose-VLA decouples VLA training into universal 3D spatial pre-training and efficient embodiment-specific post-training using discrete pose tokens, achieving SOTA results on robotic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency due to entangling high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. They overlook subtle 3D state variations crucial for robotic actions.

Method: Proposes Pose-VLA with two-stage training: 1) Pre-training extracts universal 3D spatial priors using discrete pose tokens in camera-centric space, 2) Post-training aligns with robot-specific action space. Uses pose tokens as universal representation integrating spatial grounding from 3D datasets with robotic trajectory demonstrations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on RoboTwin 2.0 with 79.5% average success rate and competitive 96.0% on LIBERO. Real-world experiments show robust generalization with only 100 demonstrations per task.

Conclusion: Pose-VLA's decoupled paradigm effectively resolves VLA misalignments by separating universal spatial grounding from embodiment-specific action learning, enabling efficient training and strong generalization in robotic tasks.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.
  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.

TL;DR: MoBind: Hierarchical contrastive learning framework that learns joint representations between IMU signals and 2D pose sequences for cross-modal tasks like retrieval, synchronization, localization, and action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate cross-modal understanding between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and visual motion data, addressing challenges of filtering visual background noise, modeling multi-sensor IMU configurations, and achieving fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: Hierarchical contrastive learning framework that aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. Decomposes full-body motion into local body-part trajectories paired with corresponding IMUs, then uses token-level temporal segment alignment combined with local (body-part) and global (body-wide) motion aggregation.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks (cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject/body-part localization, action recognition) on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans datasets, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency.

Conclusion: MoBind effectively addresses key challenges in IMU-video alignment through hierarchical contrastive learning, enabling accurate cross-modal understanding with applications in motion analysis and human activity recognition.

Abstract: We aim to learn a joint representation between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and 2D pose sequences extracted from video, enabling accurate cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject and body-part localization, and action recognition. To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anchor-guided generative models for trajectory planning rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that create a trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance, requiring sufficient coverage of trajectory distribution for robustness.

Method: Three key designs: (1) Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) for continuous trajectory space representation, (2) MeanFlow Identity adaptation for end-to-end planning to eliminate ODE solver errors and accelerate inference, (3) lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) for implicit trajectory selection or reconstruction via attention weights.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance on NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark without PDM Score supervision and demonstrates exceptional inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MeanFuser provides a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving by overcoming limitations of discrete anchor vocabularies and improving both performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Generative models have shown great potential in trajectory planning. Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Conclusion: DEFNet addresses limitations of existing BIQA methods through effective multitask optimization, robust information fusion, and advanced uncertainty estimation, achieving superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: VBVR introduces a massive video reasoning dataset (1M+ clips, 200 tasks) and benchmark to study scaling and generalization in video reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video reasoning capabilities are underexplored compared to visual quality, and systematic study is hindered by lack of large-scale training data for spatiotemporal reasoning tasks.

Method: Created Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset with 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over 1 million video clips. Developed VBVR-Bench with rule-based, human-aligned scorers for verifiable evaluation.

Result: Dataset is approximately 3 orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. Early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks were observed in scaling studies.

Conclusion: VBVR provides foundation for next-stage research in generalizable video reasoning, with data, benchmark toolkit, and models publicly available.

Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .

### [79] [TokenTrace: Multi-Concept Attribution through Watermarked Token Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19019)
*Li Zhang,Shruti Agarwal,John Collomosse,Pengtao Xie,Vishal Asnani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenTrace is a novel watermarking framework for generative AI that enables robust multi-concept attribution by embedding signatures in both text embeddings and latent noise, with query-based retrieval for disentangling multiple concepts in single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution, posing IP challenges. Existing watermarking methods fail in complex multi-concept scenarios where multiple elements (objects and styles) are composed in single images and need individual attribution.

Method: TokenTrace embeds secret signatures by simultaneously perturbing both text prompt embeddings and initial latent noise in diffusion models. For retrieval, it uses a query-based module that takes generated images and textual queries specifying which concepts to retrieve, enabling disentanglement and independent verification of multiple concepts.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.

Conclusion: TokenTrace provides an effective solution for multi-concept attribution in generative AI, addressing limitations of existing watermarking methods and enabling robust IP protection in complex compositional scenarios.

Abstract: Generative AI models pose a significant challenge to intellectual property (IP), as they can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution. While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.

*Hui Shan,Ming Li,Haitao Yang,Kai Zheng,Sizhe Zheng,Yanwei Fu,Xiangru Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for generating diverse, production-ready PBR textures for 3D garments from non-isometric images using physically simulated video data, cross-pose learning, and iterative baking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes have limited texture diversity, and current generative methods require strict topological consistency or accurate mesh deformation, constraining texture generation quality and flexibility.

Method: Construct 3D Garment Videos dataset with consistent geometry/material supervision across deformations; use Nano Banana for non-isometric image editing; propose iterative baking with uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting to fuse multi-view predictions.

Result: The feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile, spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning and production-ready PBR textures without requiring strict topological consistency.

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

### [81] [An interpretable framework using foundation models for fish sex identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19022)
*Zheng Miao,Tien-Chieh Hung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishProtoNet is a non-invasive computer vision framework for sex identification of endangered delta smelt fish, using foundation models and interpretable prototype networks to achieve 74-81% accuracy across different life stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fish sex identification methods are invasive/stressful and can cause mortality, which is particularly problematic for endangered species like delta smelt. There's a need for non-invasive, accurate sex identification to support breeding and conservation efforts.

Method: FishProtoNet uses three components: 1) Fish ROI extraction with visual foundation models to reduce background noise, 2) Feature extraction from fish ROIs, and 3) Interpretable prototype network for sex identification that provides learned prototype representations for interpretability.

Result: Achieved 74.40% accuracy (74.27% F1) for early spawning stage and 81.16% accuracy (79.43% F1) for post-spawning stage. Subadult stage identification remains challenging due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish.

Conclusion: FishProtoNet provides a robust, non-invasive solution for endangered fish sex identification with interpretability, though challenges remain for immature fish stages. The framework is publicly available for further research and application.

Abstract: Accurate sex identification in fish is vital for optimizing breeding and management strategies in aquaculture, particularly for species at the risk of extinction. However, most existing methods are invasive or stressful and may cause additional mortality, posing severe risks to threatened or endangered fish populations. To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish. The source code of FishProtoNet is publicly available at: https://github.com/zhengmiao1/Fish_sex_identification

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A calibration framework for CLIP prompt tuning that improves confidence calibration and predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning of vision-language models like CLIP often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty, which needs to be addressed for more trustworthy model predictions.

Method: Extends standard cross-entropy loss with two regularizers: (1) mean-variance margin penalty to stabilize inter-class logit margins, and (2) text moment-matching loss to align tuned text embeddings with frozen CLIP counterparts.

Result: Significantly reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, on both base and novel classes.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration framework enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of pretrained CLIP embedding space, leading to better calibrated confidence estimates and more trustworthy predictions.

Abstract: Prompt tuning of large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP enables efficient task adaptation without updating model weights. However, it often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty. We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization. Through extensive experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques on both base and novel classes

### [83] [OpenVO: Open-World Visual Odometry with Temporal Dynamics Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19035)
*Phuc D. A. Nguyen,Anh N. Nhu,Ming C. Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVO is a novel visual odometry framework that handles varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras for robust ego-motion estimation from dashcam footage, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VO methods have two major limitations: they're trained on fixed observation frequencies and require calibrated cameras. This prevents their application to real-world dashcam footage which often has varying frame rates and uncalibrated cameras, limiting their use for extracting trajectories from rare driving events.

Method: OpenVO explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models to handle varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras.

Result: The method achieves more than 20% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 benchmarks. Under varying observation rates, it achieves 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics.

Conclusion: OpenVO demonstrates superior versatility for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications, particularly for extracting trajectories from dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras.

Abstract: We introduce OpenVO, a novel framework for Open-world Visual Odometry (VO) with temporal awareness under limited input conditions. OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Under varying observation rate settings, our method is significantly more robust, achieving 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics. These results demonstrate the versatility of OpenVO for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications.

### [84] [Direction-aware 3D Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19063)
*Quan Liu,Weihao Xuan,Junjue Wang,Naoto Yokoya,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new paradigm for direction-aware 3D large multimodal models by recovering missing ego poses from point cloud benchmarks and aligning point cloud data accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D LMMs rely on ego poses for directional reasoning, but most point cloud benchmarks contain directional queries without corresponding ego poses, making them ill-posed for 3D multimodal modeling.

Method: Two novel designs: 1) PoseRecover - automatic pose recovery pipeline matching questions with ego poses via object-frustum intersection and visibility checks, 2) PoseAlign - transforms point cloud data to align with identified ego poses instead of injecting poses into prompts or features.

Result: Consistent improvements across multiple 3D LMM backbones (LL3DA, LL3DA-SONATA, Chat-Scene, 3D-LLAVA), with ScanRefer mIoU improved by 30.0% and Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge accuracy improved by 11.7%.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, generic, training-efficient (only requires instruction tuning), and establishes a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D-LMMs by properly handling ego pose information.

Abstract: 3D large multimodal models (3D LMMs) rely heavily on ego poses for enabling directional question-answering and spatial reasoning. However, most existing point cloud benchmarks contain rich directional queries but lack the corresponding ego poses, making them inherently ill-posed in 3D large multimodal modelling. In this work, we redefine a new and rigorous paradigm that enables direction-aware 3D LMMs by identifying and supplementing ego poses into point cloud benchmarks and transforming the corresponding point cloud data according to the identified ego poses. We enable direction-aware 3D LMMs with two novel designs. The first is PoseRecover, a fully automatic pose recovery pipeline that matches questions with ego poses from RGB-D video extrinsics via object-frustum intersection and visibility check with Z-buffers. The second is PoseAlign that transforms the point cloud data to be aligned with the identified ego poses instead of either injecting ego poses into textual prompts or introducing pose-encoded features in the projection layers. Extensive experiments show that our designs yield consistent improvements across multiple 3D LMM backbones such as LL3DA, LL3DA-SONATA, Chat-Scene, and 3D-LLAVA, improving ScanRefer mIoU by 30.0% and Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge accuracy by 11.7%. In addition, our approach is simple, generic, and training-efficient, requiring only instruction tuning while establishing a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D-LMMs.

*Quan Liu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L3DR is a 3D-aware LiDAR diffusion framework that rectifies range-view artifacts to achieve superior geometry realism by predicting point-level 3D offsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing range-view based LiDAR diffusion models achieve 2D photo-realism but neglect 3D geometry realism, generating artifacts like depth bleeding and wavy surfaces that compromise geometric accuracy.

Method: A 3D residual regression network that predicts point-level offsets in 3D space to rectify range-view artifacts, combined with a Welsch Loss that focuses on local geometry while ignoring anomalous regions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks (KITTI, KITTI360, nuScenes, Waymo) with superior geometry realism, and general applicability to different LiDAR diffusion models with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: L3DR successfully addresses the geometry realism limitations of 2D range-view LiDAR diffusion by leveraging 3D-aware rectification, demonstrating that 3D models inherently generate sharper and more authentic boundaries than 2D approaches.

Abstract: Range-view (RV) based LiDAR diffusion has recently made huge strides towards 2D photo-realism. However, it neglects 3D geometry realism and often generates various RV artifacts such as depth bleeding and wavy surfaces. We design L3DR, a 3D-aware LiDAR Diffusion and Rectification framework that can regress and cancel RV artifacts in 3D space and restore local geometry accurately. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that 3D models are inherently superior to 2D models in generating sharp and authentic boundaries. Leveraging such analysis, we design a 3D residual regression network that rectifies RV artifacts and achieves superb geometry realism by predicting point-level offsets in 3D space. On top of that, we design a Welsch Loss that helps focus on local geometry and ignore anomalous regions effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks including KITTI, KITTI360, nuScenes and Waymo show that the proposed L3DR achieves state-of-the-art generation and superior geometry-realism consistently. In addition, L3DR is generally applicable to different LiDAR diffusion models with little computational overhead.

*Liangsi Lu,Xuhang Chen,Minzhe Guo,Shichu Li,Jingchao Wang,Yang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChordEdit enables high-fidelity one-step text-guided image editing on fast T2I models by treating editing as an optimal transport problem, avoiding distortion and preserving consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free editors fail on one-step T2I models, causing severe object distortion and loss of consistency in non-edited regions due to erratic trajectories from naive vector arithmetic.

Method: Recasts editing as transport problem between source/target distributions defined by text prompts. Uses dynamic optimal transport theory to derive low-energy control strategy, yielding smoothed, variance-reduced editing field traversable in single large integration step.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity one-step editing that is fast, lightweight, and precise, enabling true real-time editing on challenging one-step T2I models without training or inversion.

Conclusion: ChordEdit provides a model-agnostic, training-free, inversion-free solution for stable one-step text-guided image editing by applying optimal transport theory to create principled low-energy editing trajectories.

Abstract: The advent of one-step text-to-image (T2I) models offers unprecedented synthesis speed. However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage restoration-guided framework (RG-KCR) improves Kuzushiji character recognition under seal interference, achieving 95.33% Top-1 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Kuzushiji character recognition methods perform well on clean documents but struggle with seal interference, which is common in pre-modern Japanese documents where seals often overlap characters.

Method: Proposed RG-KCR framework with three stages: 1) Character detection using YOLOv12-medium, 2) Restoration to mitigate seal interference, 3) Classification using Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Metom classifier.

Result: YOLOv12-medium achieved 98.0% precision and 93.3% recall for detection. Restoration stage improved Metom classifier's Top-1 accuracy from 93.45% to 95.33%. PSNR and SSIM metrics used to evaluate restoration quality.

Conclusion: The RG-KCR framework effectively addresses seal interference in Kuzushiji character recognition, significantly improving classification accuracy while maintaining strong detection performance. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Kuzushiji was one of the most popular writing styles in pre-modern Japan and was widely used in both personal letters and official documents. However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%. The implementation code of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/RG-KCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ani3DHuman combines kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors to generate photorealistic 3D human animations with both rigid motion and realistic non-rigid dynamics like clothing movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human animation methods have limitations: kinematics-based approaches lack realistic non-rigid dynamics (clothing, hair), while video diffusion methods suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. There's a need for photorealistic animation that preserves both motion quality and identity fidelity.

Method: 1) Introduces layered motion representation disentangling rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. 2) Uses kinematic method for rigid motion to produce coarse renderings. 3) Employs video diffusion model guided by coarse renderings to restore residual non-rigid motion. 4) Proposes self-guided stochastic sampling to handle out-of-distribution renderings, combining stochastic sampling for quality with self-guidance for identity fidelity. 5) Uses restored videos to optimize residual non-rigid motion field.

Result: Extensive experiments show Ani3DHuman generates photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods in both motion quality and identity preservation.

Conclusion: Ani3DHuman successfully bridges kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors, achieving photorealistic 3D human animation with realistic non-rigid dynamics while maintaining identity fidelity through novel self-guided stochastic sampling.

Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman.

TL;DR: CREM is a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative capabilities in MLLMs through compression-based prompts and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at comprehension tasks but struggle with embedding-based retrieval due to format/objective mismatch. Existing contrastive fine-tuning approaches sacrifice generative capabilities, but both tasks share fundamental cognitive mechanisms.

Method: Proposes CREM with compression-based prompt design using learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics, and compression-driven training integrating contrastive and generative objectives via compression-aware attention.

Result: Achieves SOTA retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Shows generative supervision improves representational quality under compression-driven paradigm.

Conclusion: CREM demonstrates that unified framework can enhance multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability, highlighting shared cognitive mechanisms between tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success in comprehension tasks such as visual description and visual question answering. However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Our findings highlight that generative supervision can further improve the representational quality of MLLMs under the proposed compression-driven paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMatch is a semantic-aware coarse-to-fine framework for dense semantic correspondence between strongly non-isometric shapes across different object categories, using language-guided segmentation and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches for dense shape correspondence are limited to near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (mainly human shapes). There's a need for methods that can handle cross-category objects and strongly non-isometric shapes, which remains challenging and under-explored.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine approach: 1) Coarse stage: Class-agnostic 3D segmentation to get semantic parts, use MLLMs to identify part names, then VLMs to extract text embeddings for matching semantic parts. 2) Fine stage: Use coarse correspondences to guide dense correspondence learning through rank-based contrastive scheme.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness for universal object categories without predefined part proposals.

Conclusion: UniMatch enables universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes through class-agnostic segmentation, language guidance, and rank-based contrastive learning, overcoming limitations of prior isometric and category-restricted approaches.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences between shapes is a crucial task in computer vision and graphics, while prior approaches depend on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (i.e., only operate for human shapes). However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: SymPL framework improves VLMs' allocentric spatial reasoning by converting allocentric questions into symbolic-layout representations that VLMs handle better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform well in egocentric spatial reasoning but struggle with allocentric reasoning (object-centered perspectives), creating a significant performance gap that needs addressing.

Method: Introduces Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL) framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning using four key factors: projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization to convert allocentric questions into symbolic-layout representations.

Result: SymPL substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, with each component contributing critically to the gains.

Conclusion: SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning, bridging the gap between VLMs' egocentric strengths and allocentric reasoning needs.

Abstract: Perspective-aware spatial reasoning involves understanding spatial relationships from specific viewpoints-either egocentric (observer-centered) or allocentric (object-centered). While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.

*Jiapeng Li,Yingjing Huang,Fan Zhang,Yu liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreetTree is the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset for fine-grained street tree classification, containing over 12M images of 8,300+ species across 133 countries, addressing the lack of geographically diverse public datasets for urban tree management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained street tree classification is crucial for urban planning and ecosystem assessment, but progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees.

Method: Created StreetTree dataset with over 12 million images covering 8,300+ common street tree species collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries, supplemented with expert-verified observational data and hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species).

Result: The dataset poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models due to high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed distributions, seasonal variations, and diverse imaging conditions. Extensive experiments established baselines and revealed limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: StreetTree serves as a key resource for refined urban street tree management and research, driving advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science by addressing real-world complexities in street tree classification.

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of street trees is a crucial task for urban planning, streetscape management, and the assessment of urban ecosystem services. However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles. In addition, we provide a hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species) to support research in hierarchical classification and representation learning. Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science.

*Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mapping Networks replace high-dimensional weight spaces with compact latent vectors, achieving 99.5% parameter reduction while maintaining or improving performance across vision and sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep learning models face efficiency challenges due to escalating parameter counts, leading to training inefficiency and overfitting problems. The paper hypothesizes that trained parameters of large networks reside on smooth, low-dimensional manifolds.

Method: Introduces Mapping Networks that replace high-dimensional weight spaces with compact, trainable latent vectors. Uses a Mapping Theorem enforced by a dedicated Mapping Loss to theoretically and practically demonstrate existence of mapping from latent space to target weight space.

Result: Achieves 99.5% parameter reduction (approximately 500× reduction) while significantly reducing overfitting. Performs comparably or better than target networks across complex vision and sequence tasks including Image Classification and Deepfake Detection.

Conclusion: Mapping Networks provide an effective solution to parameter explosion in deep learning by leveraging the low-dimensional manifold structure of trained parameters, enabling dramatic parameter reduction without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The escalating parameter counts in modern deep learning models pose a fundamental challenge to efficient training and resolution of overfitting. We address this by introducing the \emph{Mapping Networks} which replace the high dimensional weight space by a compact, trainable latent vector based on the hypothesis that the trained parameters of large networks reside on smooth, low-dimensional manifolds. Henceforth, the Mapping Theorem enforced by a dedicated Mapping Loss, shows the existence of a mapping from this latent space to the target weight space both theoretically and in practice. Mapping Networks significantly reduce overfitting and achieve comparable to better performance than target network across complex vision and sequence tasks, including Image Classification, Deepfake Detection etc, with $\mathbf{99.5\%}$, i.e., around $500\times$ reduction in trainable parameters.

### [94] [CaReFlow: Cyclic Adaptive Rectified Flow for Multimodal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19140)
*Sijie Mai,Shiqin Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a rectified flow-based method for multimodal distribution alignment that uses one-to-many mapping and adaptive relaxed alignment to reduce modality gaps, achieving competitive results in affective computing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods suffer from modality gaps, and previous approaches using diffusion models or adversarial learning focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing source modality data to the global distribution of target modality, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Extends rectified flow for modality distribution mapping with: 1) One-to-many mapping strategy allowing each source data point to observe overall target distribution, 2) Adaptive relaxed alignment with stricter alignment for same-sample pairs and relaxed mapping for different samples/categories, 3) Cyclic rectified flow to prevent information loss by enabling feature translation back to original.

Result: Achieves very competitive results on multiple multimodal affective computing tasks even with simple fusion methods, and visualizations confirm effective reduction of modality gaps.

Conclusion: The proposed rectified flow-based approach with one-to-many mapping and adaptive alignment effectively reduces modality gaps in multimodal learning, enabling better fusion and competitive performance in affective computing applications.

Abstract: Modality gap significantly restricts the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based AI system (RT-DETR) achieves near-perfect detection of fungal hyphae in KOH microscopy images for dermatophytosis diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KOH microscopy for dermatophytosis suffers from artefacts, poor keratin clearance, and high inter-observer variability, requiring automated, reliable detection of fungal structures.

Method: Used RT-DETR transformer architecture trained on 2,540 manually annotated KOH microscopy images with multi-class labeling to distinguish fungal elements from artefacts, employing morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain hyphae structural integrity.

Result: Achieved recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, AP@0.50 of 93.56% at object level, and 100% sensitivity with 98.8% accuracy at image-level diagnosis, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing diagnoses.

Conclusion: The AI system serves as a highly reliable automated screening tool that bridges image-level analysis with clinical decision-making in dermatomycology, demonstrating robust localization even in artefact-rich fields.

Abstract: Dermatophytosis is commonly assessed using potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, yet accurate recognition of fungal hyphae is hindered by artefacts, heterogeneous keratin clearance, and notable inter-observer variability. This study presents a transformer-based detection framework using the RT-DETR model architecture to achieve precise, query-driven localization of fungal structures in high-resolution KOH images. A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%. When aggregated for image-level diagnosis, the model achieved 100% sensitivity and 98.8% accuracy, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing a single diagnosis. Qualitative outputs confirmed the robust localization of low-contrast hyphae even in artefact-rich fields. These results highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) system can serve as a highly reliable, automated screening tool, effectively bridging the gap between image-level analysis and clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flash-VAED: A universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders in video diffusion models that achieves 6× speedup while maintaining 96.9% reconstruction quality through channel pruning and operator optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models enable high-quality video synthesis but suffer from costly inference. As diffusion transformers become more efficient, VAE decoders become the new latency bottleneck. There's a need to reduce VAE decoder latency while maintaining quality and alignment with original latent distributions.

Method: Proposes two main techniques: (1) independence-aware channel pruning to mitigate channel redundancy, and (2) stage-wise dominant operator optimization to address the high cost of causal 3D convolutions. Constructs Flash-VAED family and uses a three-phase dynamic distillation framework to transfer capabilities from original VAE decoders.

Result: Achieves approximately 6× speedup while maintaining reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Accelerates end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0. Outperforms baselines in both quality and speed on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders.

Conclusion: Flash-VAED provides an effective universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that significantly reduces inference latency while preserving quality, addressing a critical bottleneck in video diffusion model pipelines.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet their inference remains costly and time-consuming. As diffusion transformers become increasingly efficient, the latency bottleneck inevitably shifts to VAE decoders. To reduce their latency while maintaining quality, we propose a universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that preserves full alignment with the original latent distribution. Specifically, we propose (1) an independence-aware channel pruning method to effectively mitigate severe channel redundancy, and (2) a stage-wise dominant operator optimization strategy to address the high inference cost of the widely used causal 3D convolutions in VAE decoders. Based on these innovations, we construct a Flash-VAED family. Moreover, we design a three-phase dynamic distillation framework that efficiently transfers the capabilities of the original VAE decoder to Flash-VAED. Extensive experiments on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both quality and speed, achieving approximately a 6$\times$ speedup while maintaining the reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Notably, Flash-VAED accelerates the end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JavisDiT++ is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that improves quality, temporal synchrony, and human preference alignment through MS-MoE, TA-RoPE, and AV-DPO techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source joint audio-video generation methods lag behind commercial models like Veo3 in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and human preference alignment, creating a need for better open-source solutions.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) for cross-modal interaction and single-modal quality, 2) Temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) for frame-level audio-video synchronization, 3) Audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) for human preference alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only ~1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Built on Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V foundation.

Conclusion: JavisDiT++ successfully bridges the gap between open-source and commercial joint audio-video generation models through its unified framework and novel techniques, with all code, models, and datasets publicly released.

Abstract: AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio. Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules. All the code, model, and dataset are released at https://JavisVerse.github.io/JavisDiT2-page.

*Kanglei Zhou,Chang Li,Qingyi Pan,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BriMA addresses modality imbalance in continual AQA by reconstructing missing modalities and prioritizing informative samples, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-modal AQA deployments suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps, but existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue.

Method: Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA) with memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift.

Result: Experiments on three multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6-8% higher correlation and 12-15% lower error on average.

Conclusion: BriMA demonstrates a step toward robust multi-modal AQA systems under real-world deployment constraints by effectively handling modality-missing conditions in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to score how well an action is performed and is widely used in sports analysis, rehabilitation assessment, and human skill evaluation. Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\% higher correlation and 12--15\% lower error on average. These results demonstrate a step toward robust multi-modal AQA systems under real-world deployment constraints.

*Qiuhui Chen,Xuancheng Yao,Zhenglei Zhou,Xinyue Hu,Yi Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMAD is a vision-language framework that generates structured Alzheimer's disease diagnostic reports with explicit grounding of claims to multimodal evidence and anatomical localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for medical image analysis act as black boxes without aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence, which is critical for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings.

Method: EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism with two components: (1) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (2) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. The framework includes GTX-Distill to reduce annotation requirements by transferring grounding behavior from teacher to student, and Executable-Rule GRPO for reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable rewards.

Result: On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods.

Conclusion: EMAD provides a trustworthy medical vision-language framework that generates structured diagnostic reports with explicit evidence grounding, addressing the black-box problem in medical AI while maintaining clinical consistency and anatomical accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often act as black boxes, seldom aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence. This is especially critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings. We present EMAD, a vision-language framework that generates structured AD diagnostic reports in which each claim is explicitly grounded in multimodal evidence. EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism: (i) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (ii) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. To reduce dense annotation requirements, we propose GTX-Distill, which transfers grounding behavior from a teacher trained with limited supervision to a student operating on model-generated reports. We further introduce Executable-Rule GRPO, a reinforcement fine-tuning scheme with verifiable rewards that enforces clinical consistency, protocol adherence, and reasoning-diagnosis coherence. On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods. We will release code and grounding annotations to support future research in trustworthy medical vision-language models.

*Wenhao Shen,Hao Wang,Wanqi Yin,Fayao Liu,Xulei Yang,Chao Liang,Zhongang Cai,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection generates context-aware quality scores for predicted human meshes, which are used to create a preference dataset for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models to produce more physically plausible and image-consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mesh recovery from single RGB images is inherently ambiguous (multiple 3D poses can match the same 2D observation). Recent diffusion-based methods generate multiple hypotheses but often sacrifice accuracy, producing physically implausible results or predictions that drift from input images, especially under occlusion or in cluttered scenes.

Method: 1) Introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes (capturing 3D motion structure, physical feasibility, and image alignment). 2) Use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. 3) Propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models using this dataset to inject preference signals.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with the method generating more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-memory critique agent with self-reflection and group preference alignment framework effectively addresses the ambiguity and accuracy issues in diffusion-based HMR methods, leading to improved quality of generated human meshes.

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D observation. Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PositionOCR is a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that combines text spotting specialists' positional accuracy with LLMs' contextual reasoning to create a positionally-accurate MLLM for OCR-centric VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack positional reasoning for precise visual tasks like text spotting and grounding, while text spotting specialists lack semantic reasoning. There's a need to combine the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs.

Method: Introduces PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture with only 131M trainable parameters that integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning capabilities.

Result: The framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in text grounding and text spotting tasks, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.

Conclusion: PositionOCR successfully synergizes specialist efficiency with LLM contextual power to create a positionally-accurate MLLM that overcomes the limitations of both approaches while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance in OCR-centric Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, illustrating their capability to process heterogeneous data and exhibit adaptability across varied contexts. However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.

TL;DR: FUSAR-GPT is a specialized Visual Language Model for SAR imagery that introduces geospatial priors and spatiotemporal anchors to overcome limitations of existing VLMs in SAR interpretation, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Visual Language Models perform poorly on SAR imagery due to complex imaging mechanisms, scattering feature sensitivity, and lack of high-quality text data, creating a need for specialized SAR-focused VLMs.

Method: Created SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth dataset; introduced geospatial baseline model as prior knowledge; embedded multi-source remote-sensing temporal features via 'spatiotemporal anchors'; used two-stage SFT strategy to decouple knowledge injection from task execution.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing visual-language benchmarks, outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.

Conclusion: FUSAR-GPT successfully addresses SAR interpretation challenges through spatiotemporal feature embedding and decoupled training, demonstrating superior performance for SAR visual-language tasks.

Abstract: Research on the intelligent interpretation of all-weather, all-time Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for advancing remote sensing applications. In recent years, although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong open-world understanding capabilities on RGB images, their performance is severely limited when directly applied to the SAR field due to the complexity of the imaging mechanism, sensitivity to scattering features, and the scarcity of high-quality text corpora. To systematically address this issue, we constructed the inaugural SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth feature triplet dataset and developed FUSAR-GPT, a VLM specifically for SAR. FUSAR-GPT innovatively introduces a geospatial baseline model as a 'world knowledge' prior and embeds multi-source remote-sensing temporal features into the model's visual backbone via 'spatiotemporal anchors', enabling dynamic compensation for the sparse representation of targets in SAR images. Furthermore, we designed a two-stage SFT strategy to decouple the knowledge injection and task execution of large models. The spatiotemporal feature embedding and the two-stage decoupling paradigm enable FUSAR-GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several typical remote sensing visual-language benchmark tests, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.

### [104] [Prompt Tuning for CLIP on the Pretrained Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19198)
*Xi Yang,Yuanrong Xu,Weigang Zhang,Guangming Lu,David Zhang,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ManiPT performs prompt tuning on pretrained manifold to prevent representation drift and improve generalization under limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning under limited supervision causes representation drift away from pretrained manifold, degrading generalization performance. Need to constrain tuning to stay within pretrained geometric neighborhood.

Method: ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both text and image modalities to confine learned representations within pretrained geometric neighborhood. Also adds structural bias for incremental corrections to guide adaptation along transferable directions and mitigate shortcut learning.

Result: Achieves higher average performance than baselines across four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization.

Conclusion: ManiPT effectively prevents overfitting under limited supervision by keeping prompt tuning on pretrained manifold, providing explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits with limited data.

Abstract: Prompt tuning introduces learnable prompt vectors that adapt pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Across these settings, ManiPT achieves higher average performance than baseline methods. Notably, ManiPT provides an explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits under limited supervision.

*Gang Xu,Zhiyu Zhu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using pre-trained video diffusion models to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event camera data, with extensions for frame interpolation and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras capture high-speed, low-power, high-dynamic-range data but only record relative intensity changes, losing spatial information and static texture details. Need to reconstruct full video frames from sparse event streams.

Method: 1) Baseline: Directly use event data as condition for video synthesis with pre-trained video diffusion model. 2) Enhanced approach: Introduce event-based inter-frame residual guidance based on physical correlation between events and frames. 3) Extend to zero-shot video frame interpolation and prediction by modulating reverse diffusion sampling.

Result: Method significantly outperforms previous approaches on real-world and synthetic datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. Creates unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework.

Conclusion: Successfully leverages generative priors of video diffusion models to overcome event camera limitations, enabling high-fidelity video reconstruction from sparse event data with additional capabilities for interpolation and prediction.

Abstract: Event cameras excel at high-speed, low-power, and high-dynamic-range scene perception. However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.

*Zehao Deng,An Liu,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-CLIP is a zero-shot 3D anomaly detection framework that uses geometry-aware prompts and synergistic view representation learning to overcome limitations of existing CLIP-based methods that lose geometric details when projecting 3D point clouds to 2D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot 3D anomaly detection methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, which inherently loses geometric details and provides incomplete visual understanding with single 2D modality, limiting detection of diverse anomaly types.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors using Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM) for global shape context and local defect information. 2) Synergistic View Representation Learning processes rendered and depth images in parallel, fused by Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) to capitalize on complementary strengths.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale public datasets show GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GS-CLIP effectively addresses geometric detail loss and incomplete visual understanding in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection by incorporating geometric priors and synergistic multi-view learning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

*Yujie Lu,Jingwen Li,Sibo Ju,Yanzhou Su,he yao,Yisong Liu,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegMoTE is an efficient adaptive framework that transfers SAM's interactive segmentation to medical imaging with minimal annotation cost, achieving SOTA performance across diverse modalities and anatomical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to imaging heterogeneity and high annotation costs. Current SAM models lack adaptive mechanisms for medical modalities and anatomy-specific tasks, while existing medical adaptation methods suffer from noisy supervision and negative transfer from large heterogeneous datasets.

Method: SegMoTE preserves SAM's prompt interface and efficient inference while adding few learnable parameters for dynamic adaptation across modalities/tasks. It introduces progressive prompt tokenization for fully automatic segmentation, trained on MedSeg-HQ (curated dataset <1% of existing large-scale datasets).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. Represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to medical domain under extremely low annotation cost.

Conclusion: SegMoTE advances practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications by enabling efficient medical adaptation with minimal annotation requirements while maintaining SAM's original capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatically generated questions for remote sensing images are simplistic and template-based, limiting real-world deployment of question answering and visual dialogue systems. There's a need to enrich and diversify questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation (KRSVQG) model that: 1) incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources, 2) uses image captioning as intermediary representation to ground questions to images, and 3) employs vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy for low data regimes.

Result: Created two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets (NWPU-300 and TextRS-300). Evaluations show KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and generates rich questions grounded in both image content and domain knowledge.

Conclusion: Knowledge-aware visual question generation advances image understanding beyond pixels, facilitating development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research, knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.

*Joris Kirchner,Amogh Gudi,Marian Bittner,Chirag Raman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A facial manipulation method using semantic latent space of Diffusion Autoencoder with dependency-aware conditioning and orthogonal projection to disentangle Action Unit edits, enabling data augmentation for AU detector training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address label scarcity and class imbalance in facial expression analysis, particularly for Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation causes entanglement in edits.

Method: Operates in semantic latent space of pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Uses lightweight linear models with: (1) dependency-aware conditioning for AU co-activation, (2) orthogonal projection to remove nuisance attributes, and (3) expression neutralization for absolute AU editing.

Result: Generated data improves AU detector accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts. Outperforms alternative data-efficient training strategies, with improvements similar to requiring substantially more labeled data. Edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better than prior methods.

Conclusion: The method enables effective data augmentation for AU analysis by producing high-quality, disentangled facial edits that address label scarcity and class imbalance, leading to improved detector performance with fewer labeled examples.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models excel with abundant supervision, but many applications face label scarcity and class imbalance. Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis. Compared to prior methods, our edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better.

Conclusion: Incorporating external knowledge significantly improves the quality and diversity of generated questions in remote sensing visual question generation, enabling more effective question answering and visual dialogue systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing image retrieval. However, automatically generated image-based questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the real deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems.

To assess the performance of KRSVQG, we utilized two datasets that we manually annotated: NWPU-300 and TextRS-300. Results on these two datasets demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to knowledge-enriched questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAVIDA is a zero-shot video anomaly detection framework that uses pseudo-anomaly generation and multimodal LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance without training on real anomaly data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection struggles in open-world scenarios due to limited dataset diversity and poor understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. Existing methods underperform because anomalies are rare and spatio-temporally scarce.

Method: LAVIDA is an end-to-end zero-shot framework with three key components: 1) Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies, 2) Integration of Multimodal Large Language Model for enhanced semantic comprehension, and 3) Token compression using reverse attention to handle spatio-temporal scarcity and reduce computation.

Result: LAVIDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark VAD datasets for both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection in zero-shot settings, trained only on pseudo-anomalies without any real VAD data.

Conclusion: The proposed LAVIDA framework effectively addresses open-world video anomaly detection challenges through pseudo-anomaly generation, multimodal semantic understanding, and efficient token compression, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The collection and detection of video anomaly data has long been a challenging problem due to its rare occurrence and spatio-temporal scarcity. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting.

*Bowen Chen,Jake Zuena,Alan C. Bovik,Divya Kothandaraman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes attention-supervised diffusion framework for mask-free localized style transfer using attention alignment with object masks during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat style as global feature without spatial grounding, requiring handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that cause boundary artifacts and limit generalization.

Method: Attention-supervised diffusion framework that aligns attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training using two objectives: Focus loss (KL divergence) and Cover loss (binary cross-entropy). Uses modular LoRA-MoE design for efficient multi-style adaptation.

Result: Achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference with regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer without requiring masks at inference, addressing key limitations of existing approaches through attention supervision and novel evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-CAM: A gradient-free framework that identifies minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by finding the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions, using delta debugging adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAM-based approaches aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps that don't clearly identify the most essential features for predictions. There's a need for more precise, minimal explanations that preserve decision-making while eliminating redundancy.

Method: Adapts delta debugging (a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging) to identify 1-minimal subsets of representational units whose joint activation suffices to preserve predictions. Configures search strategy based on unit interactions in classifier head: tests individual units for non-interacting models and unit combinations for models with interactions.

Result: Produces minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Experimental evaluation shows DD-CAM produces more faithful explanations and achieves higher localization accuracy than state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.

Conclusion: DD-CAM provides a systematic, gradient-free approach to generate minimal sufficient explanations for vision models, offering clearer and more accurate saliency maps by isolating only the essential units needed for predictions.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for identifying minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions. Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial fruit inspection systems need to operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, but most existing works evaluate detection/classification at image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) YOLOv8 for apple localization (orchard-trained), 2) ByteTrack for multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities, 3) ResNet18 defect classifier fine-tuned on healthy-defective fruit dataset applied to cropped apple regions, with track-level aggregation for temporal consistency.

Result: Improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, demonstrating that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems. Video-level industrial metrics (track-level defect ratio, temporal consistency) show system robustness under realistic processing conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed detection-tracking framework with track-level aggregation provides stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments, suggesting tracking integration is crucial for practical industrial fruit grading systems.

Abstract: Industrial fruit inspection systems must operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, yet most existing works evaluate detection or classification at the image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams. We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRI CEKWorld with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning addresses contrast enhancement kinetics modeling in MRI by using latent alignment and difference learning to overcome sparse temporal sampling limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition is inefficient and risky, with sparse temporal sampling that limits world model training for simulating contrast enhancement kinetics. Direct generative modeling suffers from content distortion and temporal discontinuities due to missing time data.

Method: Proposes MRI CEKWorld with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL): 1) Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) creates patient-specific templates to maintain structural consistency; 2) Latent Difference Learning (LDL) interpolates unobserved intervals and enforces smooth latent space variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets show MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed STCL framework effectively addresses content distortion and temporal discontinuity issues in MRI contrast enhancement kinetics modeling, enabling more accurate simulation of continuous contrast-free dynamics.

Abstract: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics.

*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improved image purification strategy (IPv2) for ultra-low-dose CT denoising that addresses limitations of original approach by adding background and lung parenchyma denoising capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original image purification strategy for ultra-low-dose CT denoising has two limitations: 1) only suppresses noise in chest wall and bone regions while leaving background untreated, and 2) lacks dedicated mechanism for denoising lung parenchyma.

Method: Systematically redesigned image purification strategy called IPv2 with three core modules: Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules enable denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide refined label construction for testing evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world patient lung CT dataset at 2% radiation dose show IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models.

Conclusion: IPv2 effectively addresses the limitations of original image purification strategy, enhancing denoising performance in both background and lung parenchyma regions for ultra-low-dose CT applications.

Abstract: The image purification strategy constructs an intermediate distribution with aligned anatomical structures, which effectively corrects the spatial misalignment between real-world ultra-low-dose CT and normal-dose CT images and significantly enhances the structural preservation ability of denoising models. However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/Image-Purification-Strategy-v2.

*Alexandros Haliassos,Rodrigo Mira,Stavros Petridis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USR 2.0 improves upon Unified Speech Recognition by replacing expensive autoregressive pseudo-labelling with CTC-driven teacher forcing, reducing training time by half while improving robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original USR framework has two main limitations: 1) expensive training due to autoregressive pseudo-labelling, and 2) susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors from decoupled CTC/attention supervision, especially under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains.

Method: Proposes CTC-driven teacher forcing where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into decoder to generate attention targets in single forward pass. Also introduces mixed sampling to mitigate decoder exposure bias from relying solely on CTC inputs.

Result: USR 2.0 halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR benchmarks, surpassing both original USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: CTC-driven teacher forcing enables efficient and effective knowledge transfer in semi-supervised speech recognition, combining CTC robustness with attention expressiveness without costly beam search, resulting in more practical and robust unified speech recognition.

Abstract: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging has unique challenges due to noisy acquisition, low signal-to-noise ratio, and stochastic speckle patterns that hinder standard self-supervised learning methods. Existing Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) rely on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers.

Method: Proposes US-JEPA framework with Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. Uses a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, decoupling student-teacher optimization and enabling the student to expand upon teacher's semantic priors. Also introduces UltraBench benchmark for comparing ultrasound foundation models.

Result: US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines on UltraBench (public dataset spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions). First rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models.

Conclusion: Masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations. The static teacher approach addresses limitations of online teacher methods while maintaining strong performance across diverse classification tasks.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging poses unique challenges for representation learning due to its inherently noisy acquisition process. The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines. Our results demonstrate that masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations.

TL;DR: A frequency-aware defense method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that filters high-frequency adversarial noise while preserving low-frequency content to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising clean data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is vulnerable to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible perturbations can degrade rendering quality, increase computational costs, and even cause denial-of-service attacks. There's a need to address these security vulnerabilities in 3D reconstruction systems.

Method: Analyzed adversarial perturbations using wavelet transforms to understand their distinct behaviors in low- and high-frequency components. Designed a frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content, without requiring clean ground-truth supervision.

Result: The method substantially enhances 3DGS robustness against adversarial attacks across various attack intensities on multiple benchmarks. It effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining scene authenticity, without significantly impairing training on clean data.

Conclusion: The work addresses overlooked vulnerabilities in 3D Gaussian Splatting by proposing an effective frequency-aware defense that achieves a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs, paving the way for more secure 3D reconstruction systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for real-time and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from posed images. However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.

TL;DR: UP-Fuse is an uncertainty-aware LiDAR-camera fusion framework for robust 3D panoptic segmentation that maintains performance under camera degradation, calibration drift, or sensor failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-camera fusion methods for 3D panoptic segmentation are vulnerable to camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, or failure under adverse conditions, compromising perception system reliability in safety-critical robotic applications.

Method: Projects LiDAR data into 2D range-view and encodes it, extracts camera features into same shared space, uses uncertainty-guided fusion module with learned uncertainty maps to dynamically modulate cross-modal interaction, and employs hybrid 2D-3D transformer decoder to mitigate spatial ambiguities and directly predict 3D panoptic masks.

Result: Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate UP-Fuse maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, showing efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: UP-Fuse provides a robust uncertainty-aware fusion framework suitable for safety-critical robotic perception that handles camera degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure while maintaining reliable 3D panoptic segmentation performance.

Abstract: LiDAR-camera fusion enhances 3D panoptic segmentation by leveraging camera images to complement sparse LiDAR scans, but it also introduces a critical failure mode. Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings.

TL;DR: PoseCraft: A diffusion framework using tokenized 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as conditioning tokens for photorealistic human avatar synthesis with explicit 3D pose and camera controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars have limitations: skinning-based workflows require manual rigging or template fittings, while neural volumetric methods need canonical templates and re-optimization for each new pose. There's a need for a method that preserves 3D semantics under large pose/viewpoint changes while producing photorealistic results.

Method: PoseCraft uses a diffusion framework with tokenized 3D interface: encodes sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens, injects them into diffusion via cross-attention (instead of relying on rasterized 2D geometry). Also developed GenHumanRF data generation workflow to render diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions for training at scale.

Result: PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering state-of-the-art while better preserving fabric and hair details.

Conclusion: The tokenized 3D conditioning approach effectively preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity, enabling photorealistic human avatar synthesis with explicit pose and camera controls that faithfully captures identity and appearance.

Abstract: Digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars with explicit 3D pose and camera controls are central to VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing skinning-based workflows require laborious manual rigging or template-based fittings, while neural volumetric methods rely on canonical templates and re-optimization for each unseen pose. We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance. To train and evaluate at scale, we also implement GenHumanRF, a data generation workflow that renders diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions. Our experiments show that PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering SOTA while better preserving fabric and hair details.

*Nilay Yilmaz,Maitreya Patel,Naga Sai Abhiram Kusumba,Yixuan He,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with spatial visualization tasks like paper folding and hole punching, showing poor performance in prediction and planning despite strong generalization abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) possess spatial visualization abilities - the mental capacity to imagine, transform, and manipulate spatial characteristics of objects and actions.

Method: Developed MentalBlackboard benchmark with Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests in two core tasks: prediction (forecasting outcomes) and planning (determining steps). Evaluated VLMs on symmetrical transformations, rotations, and multi-stage symmetry processes.

Result: Models struggle with symmetrical transformations even when predicting unfolding steps correctly. Rotations challenge physical situational awareness. Planning tasks reveal limitations in analyzing symmetrical relationships and implementing multi-stage symmetry processes. Claude Opus 4.1 achieved highest planning score at only 10% accuracy. Top model o3 reached 71.6% on generalization tasks but only 25% on text-based prediction.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in spatial visualization abilities, particularly with symmetrical transformations, rotations, and multi-stage symmetry processes, indicating they lack the mental spatial manipulation capabilities that humans possess.

Abstract: Spatial visualization is the mental ability to imagine, transform, and manipulate the spatial characteristics of objects and actions. This intelligence is a part of human cognition where actions and perception are connected on a mental level. To explore whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit this ability, we develop MentalBlackboard, an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests within two core tasks: prediction and planning. Our prediction experiments reveal that models struggle with applying symmetrical transformations, even when they predict the sequence of unfolding steps correctly. Also, rotations introduce a significant challenge to the physical situational awareness for models. The planning task reveals limitations of models in analyzing symmetrical relationships and in implementing the multi-stage symmetry process, with Claude Opus 4.1 achieving the highest planning score at an accuracy of 10\%. The top-performing model, o3, attains a peak performance of 71.6\% on the generalization task, which does not require spatial visualization but transfers spatial data; however, it achieves only 25\% accuracy on text-based prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD), a task for predicting complete RGBA layers from single RGB images using flexible user prompts, along with a large-scale dataset (RefLade) and baseline model (RefLayer).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches operate holistically on entire images, limiting precise object-level control. Layered representations provide more intuitive and structured frameworks for interpreting and editing visual content by separating scenes into objects, context, and effects.

Method: 1) Introduces RLD task for predicting RGBA layers from RGB images conditioned on user prompts (spatial inputs, language, combinations). 2) Creates RefLade dataset with 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets from scalable data engine plus 100K manually curated layers. 3) Develops automatic evaluation protocol aligned with human preferences. 4) Presents RefLayer baseline model for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition.

Result: The approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition with strong visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Shows strong zero-shot generalization capabilities in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RLD establishes a well-defined, benchmarkable research task for compositional understanding and controllable editing. The RefLade dataset and RefLayer baseline provide foundations for advancing layered representation learning and precise object-aware image manipulation.

Abstract: Precise, object-aware control over visual content is essential for advanced image editing and compositional generation. Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: CL-MC is a detector-in-the-loop framework that uses high-confidence detections to correct memory drift in SAM2 tracking for glottic opening localization in emergency intubation videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization is challenging due to weaknesses of single-frame detectors (lack temporal context) and foundation-model trackers (suffer from memory drift). Emergency intubation videos present rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities requiring robust, temporally aware solutions.

Method: Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC) supervises Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, preventing drift accumulation without requiring training.

Result: On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared to SAM2 variants and open loop methods.

Conclusion: Memory correction is a crucial component for reliable clinical video tracking, and CL-MC provides an effective training-free solution for complex endoscopic scenes.

Abstract: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization remains challenging due to the complementary weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers: the former lacks temporal context, while the latter suffers from memory drift. Specifically, in video laryngoscopy, rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities in emergency settings require a robust, temporally aware solution that can prevent progressive tracking errors. We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods.

Motivation: Current pre-trained foundation models (LLMs/VLMs) struggle with long-tail pattern recognition tasks. Fine-tuning is often infeasible due to lack of training data and high computational overhead, creating a need for efficient few-shot solutions.

Method: ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic lightweight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. It uses adaptive data augmentation based on Multi-Armed Bandit mechanism with a modified upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce gradient shifting and ensure convergence.

Result: ADAMAB achieves superior performance in multi-modal experiments with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples per class.

Conclusion: ADAMAB provides an efficient, data-efficient framework for few-shot pattern recognition that avoids expensive fine-tuning while significantly improving accuracy on long-tail tasks with minimal training data.

Abstract: Recognizing implicit visual and textual patterns is essential in many real-world applications of modern AI. However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class.

TL;DR: Stair Pooling improves U-Net for biomedical image segmentation by reducing information loss during down-sampling through concatenated small pooling operations, achieving 3.8% average Dice score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-Net architectures struggle with capturing long-range information due to conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency over information retention, leading to significant information loss.

Method: Introduces Stair Pooling that moderates down-sampling pace by using concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations, reducing dimensionality reduction from 1/4 to 1/2 per 2D pooling step. Can be adapted for 3D pooling. Uses transfer entropy to select optimal down-sampling paths.

Result: Extensive experiments on three biomedical image segmentation benchmarks show Stair Pooling increases both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by average 3.8% in Dice scores. Quantitative analysis demonstrates reduced information loss.

Conclusion: Stair Pooling is an effective strategy for improving U-Net segmentation by preserving more spatial information during down-sampling, enhancing long-range information capture and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.

*Hefei Mei,Zirui Wang,Chang Xu,Jianyuan Guo,Minjing Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PA-Attack is a gray-box adversarial attack method for Large Vision-Language Models that uses prototype-anchored guidance and attention enhancement to achieve strong cross-task generalization and attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods have limitations: white-box attacks don't generalize well across tasks, and black-box methods rely on expensive transfer attacks. The vision encoder, which is standardized and shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot point for more efficient attacks.

Method: PA-Attack uses prototype-anchored guidance to provide stable attack direction toward a general dissimilar prototype, addressing attribute-restricted issues. It then employs a two-stage attention enhancement: (1) uses token-level attention scores to focus perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (2) adaptively recalibrates attention weights to track evolving attention during adversarial generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization.

Conclusion: PA-Attack effectively addresses the limitations of previous adversarial attack methods for LVLMs by leveraging the standardized vision encoder as a gray-box pivot, using prototype guidance and attention enhancement to achieve superior cross-task generalization and attack performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are foundational to modern multimodal applications, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.

TL;DR: Prefer-DAS: A promptable multitask model for domain adaptive segmentation that uses sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels, outperforming SAM-like methods and achieving near-supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods for electron microscopy segmentation have limited and biased performance, hindering practical applications. The paper aims to develop a more realistic yet annotation-efficient approach using sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels.

Method: Prefer-DAS integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning in a promptable multitask model. It introduces Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO), sparse LPO (SLPO), and Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO) for alignment with human feedback. The model works with full, partial, or no point prompts during training/inference.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks show Prefer-DAS outperforms SAM-like methods and other unsupervised/weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation. Performance is very close to or exceeds supervised models.

Conclusion: Prefer-DAS provides an effective solution for domain adaptive segmentation with strong generalizability and flexibility, enabling both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS depending on annotation availability, and achieving near-supervised performance with minimal annotation effort.

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) is a promising paradigm for delineating intracellular structures from various large-scale electron microscopy (EM) without incurring extensive annotated data in each domain. However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models.

Method: Propose Hepato-LLaVA with Sparse Topo-Pack Attention that models 2D tissue topology to aggregate local diagnostic evidence while preserving global context. Also create HepatoPathoVQA dataset with 33K expert-validated QA pairs.

Result: Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations in current computational pathology methods for hepatocellular carcinoma analysis through specialized architecture and high-quality clinical data.

Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of multi-scale data, we present HepatoPathoVQA, a clinically grounded dataset comprising 33K hierarchically structured question-answer pairs validated by expert pathologists. Our experiments demonstrate that Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Dong-Guw Lee,Tai Hyoung Rhee,Hyunsoo Jang,Young-Sik Shin,Ukcheol Shin,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TherA is a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that uses thermal-aware embeddings and diffusion models to generate diverse, physically plausible thermal infrared images with fine-grained control over scene conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale thermal infrared (TIR) data collection and annotation is difficult and expensive. Existing RGB-to-TIR translation methods rely too much on RGB priors and ignore thermal physics, producing unrealistic heat distributions.

Method: TherA combines TherA-VLM (Vision-Language Model) with a latent-diffusion-based translator. TherA-VLM generates thermal-aware embeddings encoding scene, object, material, and heat-emission context from RGB images and user prompts. The diffusion model uses these embeddings for realistic TIR synthesis with control over time, weather, and object states.

Result: TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance with up to 33% improvement in zero-shot translation performance averaged across all metrics compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: TherA provides a practical solution for generating diverse and thermally plausible TIR data from RGB images, addressing the data bottleneck in TIR-based perception while maintaining physical realism through thermal-aware embeddings.

Abstract: Despite the inherent advantages of thermal infrared(TIR) imaging, large-scale data collection and annotation remain a major bottleneck for TIR-based perception. A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.

*Yifeng Huang,Gia Khanh Nguyen,Minh Hoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountEx is a discriminative visual counting framework that allows users to specify both what to count AND what to exclude, addressing limitations of existing methods that struggle with visually similar distractors in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based counting methods only allow inclusion prompts (what to count) but fail in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting when visually similar distractors are present.

Method: CountEx uses multimodal prompts (natural language + optional visual exemplars) for both inclusion and exclusion. It features a Discriminative Query Refinement module that: 1) identifies shared visual features, 2) isolates exclusion-specific patterns, and 3) applies selective suppression to refine counting queries.

Result: CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories. The authors also introduce CoCount benchmark with 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs for systematic evaluation.

Conclusion: CountEx successfully addresses the limitation of existing counting methods by enabling explicit exclusion of distractors through discriminative query refinement, significantly improving performance in cluttered scenes with visually similar objects.

Abstract: This paper presents CountEx, a discriminative visual counting framework designed to address a key limitation of existing prompt-based methods: the inability to explicitly exclude visually similar distractors. While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories.

*Jinsong Yang,Zeyuan Hu,Yichen Li,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FinSight-Net is an efficient physics-aware detection framework for underwater fish detection that addresses wavelength absorption and turbidity scattering challenges through multi-scale decoupled processing and efficient feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current underwater fish detection methods focus on stacking feature extractors or heavy attention modules but neglect the fundamental physics limitations: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering degrade contrast, blur structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition.

Method: Proposes FinSight-Net with two key components: 1) Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches to suppress backscattering artifacts and compensate distorted biological cues, and 2) Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) that restores high-frequency spatial information through long-range skip connections and pruned fusion routes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and UW-BlurredFish benchmarks. On UW-BlurredFish, reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%.

Conclusion: FinSight-Net provides a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture by explicitly addressing the physics limitations of underwater environments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) is a core capability for smart aquaculture and marine ecological monitoring. While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.

*Yecheng Zhang,Rong Zhao,Zhizhou Sha,Yong Li,Lei Wang,Ce Hou,Wen Ji,Hao Huang,Yunshan Wan,Jian Yu,Junhao Xia,Yuru Zhang,Chunlei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline aligns VLM outputs with human preferences for subjective perception tasks without model training, achieving state-of-the-art performance on urban perception benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning vision-language models with human preferences require fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which demands labeled data and GPU compute. The authors identify that VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, suggesting this gap can be closed externally without model training.

Method: Proposes UrbanAlign, a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline with three stages: 1) concept mining from human annotations to get interpretable evaluation dimensions, 2) multi-agent structured scoring using an Observer-Debater-Judge chain to extract continuous concept scores from frozen VLM, and 3) geometric calibration via locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold to align scores with human ratings.

Result: Achieves 72.2% accuracy (κ=0.45) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 percentage points and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 percentage points, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that alignment of VLMs with human preferences for subjective perception tasks can be achieved without model training through external calibration, offering an efficient, interpretable alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Aligning vision-language model (VLM) outputs with human preferences in domain-specific tasks typically requires fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, both of which demand labelled data and GPU compute. We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($κ=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.

*Jason Wu,Tianchen Zhao,Chang Liu,Jiarui Cai,Zheng Zhang,Zhuowei Li,Aaditya Singh,Xiang Xu,Mani Srivastava,Jonathan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a lightweight method that fine-tunes vision encoders using a discrete codebook to anchor visual representations, enabling domain adaptation without modifying other model components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks (medical diagnosis, fine-grained classification) because vision encoder errors cascade through the language model. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface, coupling components and requiring re-alignment when encoders change.

Method: CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning) fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space. This decoupled design allows domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model.

Result: CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks (VQARAD, PlantVillage, etc.) while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.

Conclusion: The discrete codebook approach enables seamless integration of adapted encoders with different language architectures, providing effective domain adaptation without coupling components or requiring extensive re-alignment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.

### [137] [HD-TTA: Hypothesis-Driven Test-Time Adaptation for Safer Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19454)
*Kartik Jhawar,Lipo Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HD-TTA: A hypothesis-driven test-time adaptation framework for medical segmentation that generates competing geometric hypotheses (compaction vs inflation) and selects the safest outcome based on texture consistency, improving safety metrics while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard TTA methods treat inference as blind optimization, which in safety-critical medical segmentation can cause tumor masks to spill into healthy tissue or degrade already correct predictions. There's a need for selective adaptation that prioritizes safety.

Method: Proposes Hypothesis-Driven TTA with: 1) Generation of competing geometric hypotheses (compaction to trim artifacts vs inflation to recover under-segmented tumor), 2) Representation-guided selector to choose safest outcome based on texture consistency, 3) Pre-screening Gatekeeper to skip adaptation on confident cases and prevent negative transfer.

Result: Validated on cross-domain brain tumor segmentation (adult BraTS gliomas to pediatric/meningioma domains). HD-TTA improves safety metrics: reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by ~6.4 mm and improves Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores to baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit hypothesis selection resolves the safety-adaptation trade-off, providing a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. The approach demonstrates that selective, hypothesis-driven adaptation outperforms generic optimization in safety-critical medical applications.

Abstract: Standard Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods typically treat inference as a blind optimization task, applying generic objectives to all or filtered test samples. In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LapFlow is a novel flow matching framework that uses Laplacian pyramid multi-scale representations and parallel processing with mixture-of-transformers to improve image generation quality while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance flow matching for image generation by addressing computational inefficiencies of previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, and to improve generation quality while reducing computational overhead.

Method: Decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals, processes different scales in parallel using mixture-of-transformers (MoT) with causal attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for bridging processes between scales.

Result: Achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, scales effectively to 1024×1024 resolution with lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: LapFlow provides an efficient multi-scale flow matching framework that improves generation quality, accelerates sampling, and enables scaling to high-resolution image generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Laplacian multiscale flow matching (LapFlow), a novel framework that enhances flow matching by leveraging multi-scale representations for image generative modeling. Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines. The proposed model scales effectively to high-resolution generation (up to 1024$\times$1024) while maintaining lower computational overhead.

*Jiazhang Wang,Hyelim Yang,Tianyi Wang,Florian Willomitzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces using polarization cues and structured illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D imaging methods for specular surfaces have limitations: deflectometry requires multi-shot acquisition (unsuitable for dynamic environments), Fourier-based single-shot approaches degrade with high spatial frequency/large curvature surfaces, and polarimetric methods suffer from orthographic imaging assumptions limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework combining polarization cues (providing orientation priors) with structured illumination (encoding geometric information). Uses dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation to resolve nonlinear coupling between complementary cues and directly infer surface normals.

Result: Achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed method overcomes limitations of existing techniques by combining polarization and structured illumination through deep learning, enabling single-shot, accurate 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces suitable for real-world dynamic applications.

Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware method for source-free domain adaptation in fundus image diagnosis that preserves confident predictions and leverages vision-language model's fine-grained knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods using vision-language models have two issues: 1) they forget superior predictions of the target model during adaptation, and 2) they disregard the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in ViL models that could benefit fundus image diagnosis.

Method: Proposes FRLA method with two modules: 1) Forgetting-resistant adaptation module that explicitly preserves confident predictions of the target model, and 2) Lesion-aware adaptation module that yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model to help target model be aware of lesion areas and leverage fine-grained knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms vision-language models and achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FRLA method effectively addresses forgetting issues and leverages fine-grained ViL knowledge for better SFDA performance in fundus image diagnosis.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain, with only unlabeled target domain data and the source model. Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released.

TL;DR: A spatially regularized multiple instance learning framework for whole slide image analysis that leverages spatial relationships among patches as regularization to address supervision imbalance and improve discriminative patch identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images are crucial for disease diagnosis but challenging to analyze due to their massive size and limited annotations. Existing MIL methods struggle with the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide learning of numerous patch-level features, leading to unreliable identification of discriminative patches, unstable optimization, and suboptimal solutions.

Method: Proposes a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. The approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals.

Result: Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising direction for whole slide image analysis by addressing the supervision imbalance problem through spatial regularization, leading to more stable optimization and better performance.

Abstract: Whole slide images, with their gigapixel-scale panoramas of tissue samples, are pivotal for precise disease diagnosis. However, their analysis is hindered by immense data size and scarce annotations. Existing MIL methods face challenges due to the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide the learning of numerous patch-level features. This sparse supervision makes it difficult to reliably identify discriminative patches during training, leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal solutions. We propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. Our approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for multi-image context generation and an effective training-free mechanism to enhance coherence in unified multimodal models, addressing important gaps in current evaluation and improvement methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have enabled remarkable image understanding and generation capabilities. However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations.

Motivation: The shift from general object detection to precise identification of specific targets in drone applications, where users need to input prompts to detect desired objects, particularly small objects.

Method: Modified YOLO-World architecture by replacing C2f layer in YOLOv8 backbone with C3k2 layer for better local feature representation, plus parallel processing optimization for speed and lightweight design.

Result: Outperformed original YOLO-World on VisDrone dataset: precision increased from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 from 35% to 35.5%, mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%. Also reduced parameters from 4M to 3.8M and FLOPs from 15.7B to 15.2B.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise text-guided object detection in drone applications, offering improved accuracy while being more lightweight and efficient.

Abstract: As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.

Result: Demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization and interpretability. The framework works with frozen MLLMs without any model retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ControlMLLM++ provides an effective test-time adaptation approach for region-based visual reasoning in MLLMs, offering flexibility, efficiency, and interpretability while maintaining model parameters frozen.

Abstract: We propose ControlMLLM++, a novel test-time adaptation framework that injects learnable visual prompts into frozen multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable fine-grained region-based visual reasoning without any model retraining or fine-tuning. Leveraging the insight that cross-modal attention maps intrinsically encode semantic correspondences between textual tokens and visual regions, ControlMLLM++ optimizes a latent visual token modifier during inference via a task-specific energy function to steer model attention towards user-specified areas. To enhance optimization stability and mitigate language prompt biases, ControlMLLM++ incorporates an improved optimization strategy (Optim++) and a prompt debiasing mechanism (PromptDebias). Supporting diverse visual prompt types including bounding boxes, masks, scribbles, and points, our method demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization and interpretability.

### [145] [Relational Feature Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19506)
*Byunggwan Son,Jeimin Jeon,Jeongwoo Choi,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RFC improves diffusion transformer acceleration by using input-output relationships for better feature prediction and adaptive cache scheduling, outperforming previous temporal extrapolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature caching methods for diffusion transformers rely on temporal extrapolation but suffer from significant prediction errors due to irregular magnitude changes in output features, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes relational feature caching (RFC) with two components: 1) relational feature estimation (RFE) that uses input-output relationships to estimate output feature changes, and 2) relational cache scheduling (RCS) that predicts errors using input features and performs full computations only when errors are expected to be large.

Result: Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently and significantly outperforms prior feature caching approaches.

Conclusion: RFC effectively addresses limitations of temporal extrapolation-based caching by leveraging input-output relationships for more accurate feature prediction and adaptive scheduling, providing superior acceleration for diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

### [146] [OSInsert: Towards High-authenticity and High-fidelity Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19523)
*Jingyuan Wang,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage strategy for generative image composition that achieves both high authenticity (foreground compatibility with background) and high fidelity (preservation of foreground details).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either achieve high authenticity by adjusting foreground pose/view to match background, or high fidelity by preserving foreground details accurately, but cannot achieve both simultaneously.

Method: Two-stage approach: First stage uses high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape as condition; second stage uses high-fidelity method to preserve details.

Result: Experiments on MureCOM dataset verify effectiveness of the two-stage strategy. Code and model released publicly.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully combines the strengths of both high-authenticity and high-fidelity approaches to achieve realistic composite images with both compatibility and detail preservation.

Abstract: Generative image composition aims to regenerate the given foreground object in the background image to produce a realistic composite image. Some high-authenticity methods can adjust foreground pose/view to be compatible with background, while some high-fidelity methods can preserve the foreground details accurately. However, existing methods can hardly achieve both goals at the same time. In this work, we propose a two-stage strategy to achieve both goals. In the first stage, we use high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape, serving as the condition of high-fidelity method in the second stage. The experiments on MureCOM dataset verify the effectiveness of our two-stage strategy. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/bcmi/OSInsert-Image-Composition.

*Omprakash Chakraborty,Jose Dolz,Ismail Ben Ayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORION is a text encoder fine-tuning framework that improves vision-language models by optimizing class prototypes for better discriminability through orthogonality constraints and prototype preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have constrained performance due to suboptimal textual prototypes - standard zero-shot classifiers from frozen text encoders produce correlated or weakly separated embeddings that limit task-specific discriminability.

Method: ORION fine-tunes text encoders using only class names via low-rank adaptation. It optimizes a novel loss with two terms: 1) pairwise orthogonality between class representations, and 2) penalizing deviations from initial class prototypes. The method provides probabilistic interpretation via Huygens theorem connecting orthogonality to MLE.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks with three large VLM backbones show refined textual embeddings outperform standard CLIP prototypes. ORION consistently improves performance across zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings when added as plug-and-play module to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ORION provides an effective framework for improving VLM performance by optimizing textual prototypes through orthogonality constraints, offering significant and consistent gains across various prediction settings and benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, yet their performance remains constrained by the quality and geometry of the textual prototypes used to represent classes. Standard zero shot classifiers, derived from frozen text encoders and handcrafted prompts, may yield correlated or weakly separated embeddings that limit task specific discriminability. We introduce ORION, a text encoder fine tuning framework that improves pretrained VLMs using only class names. Our method optimizes, via low rank adaptation, a novel loss integrating two terms, one promoting pairwise orthogonality between the textual representations of the classes of a given task and the other penalizing deviations from the initial class prototypes. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of our orthogonality penalty, connecting it to the general maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle via Huygens theorem. We report extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks and three large VLM backbones, showing that the refined textual embeddings yield powerful replacements for the standard CLIP prototypes. Added as plug and play module on top of various state of the art methods, and across different prediction settings (zero shot, few shot and test time adaptation), ORION improves the performance consistently and significantly.

### [148] [Fore-Mamba3D: Mamba-based Foreground-Enhanced Encoding for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19536)
*Zhiwei Ning,Xuanang Gao,Jiaxi Cao,Runze Yang,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu,Jie Yang,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fore-Mamba3D is a novel backbone for 3D object detection that enhances foreground encoding in Mamba-based models by addressing response attenuation and restricted context representation in foreground-only sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Mamba-based 3D detection methods use bidirectional encoding on all non-empty voxels, which includes useless background information. While encoding only foreground voxels seems logical, it degrades performance due to response attenuation and limited context representation in linear modeling.

Method: 1) Sample foreground voxels based on predicted scores; 2) Design Regional-to-Global Slide Window (RGSW) to propagate information from regional splits to the entire sequence, addressing response attenuation; 3) Propose Semantic-Assisted and State Spatial Fusion Module (SASFMamba) to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within Mamba.

Result: The method achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in 3D object detection tasks.

Conclusion: Fore-Mamba3D successfully addresses limitations of previous Mamba-based approaches by focusing on foreground enhancement, alleviating distance-based and causal dependencies in linear autoregression models, and improving detection performance through better context representation.

Abstract: Linear modeling methods like Mamba have been merged as the effective backbone for the 3D object detection task. However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task.

*Xingyu Shen,Tommy Duong,Xiaodong An,Zengqi Zhao,Zebang Hu,Haoyu Hu,Ziyou Wang,Finn Guo,Simiao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cosmetic modifications like beards and makeup can fool AI age estimators into classifying minors as adults, with attack success rates up to 83% across eight tested models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age estimation systems are widely deployed for age-restricted online content but their robustness to simple cosmetic modifications hasn't been systematically evaluated, creating potential vulnerabilities in age-verification pipelines.

Method: Simulated physical attacks on 329 facial images (ages 10-21) using VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) to apply cosmetic changes: beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles. Evaluated eight models (5 specialized architectures + 3 vision-language models) using Attack Conversion Rate (ACR) metric.

Result: Synthetic beard alone achieved 28-69% ACR across all models; combined attacks shifted predicted age by +7.7 years on average and reached up to 83% ACR. Vision-language models showed lower ACR (59-71%) than specialized models (63-83%) under full attack.

Conclusion: Deployed age-verification systems have critical vulnerabilities to cosmetic modifications, highlighting the need for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.

Abstract: Age estimation systems are increasingly deployed as gatekeepers for age-restricted online content, yet their robustness to cosmetic modifications has not been systematically evaluated. We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT images suffer from noise and artifacts that distort medical analysis, requiring restoration as preprocessing. While deep learning methods exist, there's need for more transparent and efficient alternatives.

Method: Proposes a Green Learning (GL) methodology for medical image restoration, characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency. Uses low-dose CT images as specific application example.

Result: GL method achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance with smaller model size and lower inference complexity compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Green Learning provides an effective alternative to deep learning for medical image restoration, offering transparency, efficiency, and high performance simultaneously.

Abstract: This work proposes a green learning (GL) approach to restore medical images. Without loss of generality, we use low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images as examples. LDCT images are susceptible to noise and artifacts, where the imaging process introduces distortion. LDCT image restoration is an important preprocessing step for further medical analysis. Deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to solve this problem. We examine an alternative solution using the Green Learning (GL) methodology. The new restoration method is characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency, and high performance. Experiments show that our GL method offers state-of-the-art restoration performance at a smaller model size and with lower inference complexity.

*Yankuan Chi,Xiang Li,Zixuan Huang,James M. Rehg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vinedresser3D is an agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing that uses multimodal LLMs to understand prompts, localize edits, and preserve unedited content through latent space manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided 3D editing methods struggle with complex prompts, automatic localization of edits in 3D, and preservation of unedited content. There's a need for more precise and coherent 3D editing without manual masks.

Method: Uses multimodal LLM to analyze 3D assets and prompts, generates decomposed structural/appearance guidance, selects informative views for image editing, then performs inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting in 3D latent space with interleaved sampling.

Result: Outperforms prior baselines in both automatic metrics and human preference studies, enabling precise, coherent, and mask-free 3D editing across diverse editing tasks.

Conclusion: Vinedresser3D provides an effective agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing that addresses key limitations of current methods through intelligent prompt understanding and latent space manipulation.

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to modify existing 3D assets using natural-language instructions. Current methods struggle to jointly understand complex prompts, automatically localize edits in 3D, and preserve unedited content. We introduce Vinedresser3D, an agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing that operates directly in the latent space of a native 3D generative model. Given a 3D asset and an editing prompt, Vinedresser3D uses a multimodal large language model to infer rich descriptions of the original asset, identify the edit region and edit type (addition, modification, deletion), and generate decomposed structural and appearance-level text guidance. The agent then selects an informative view and applies an image editing model to obtain visual guidance. Finally, an inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting pipeline with an interleaved sampling module performs editing in the 3D latent space, enforcing prompt alignment while maintaining 3D coherence and unedited regions. Experiments on diverse 3D edits demonstrate that Vinedresser3D outperforms prior baselines in both automatic metrics and human preference studies, while enabling precise, coherent, and mask-free 3D editing.

TL;DR: DICArt introduces a discrete diffusion framework for articulated object pose estimation, using conditional diffusion with flow decider and hierarchical kinematic coupling for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods struggle with large search spaces and fail to incorporate kinematic constraints, leading to inaccurate articulated object pose estimation.

Method: Formulates pose estimation as conditional discrete diffusion process with flow decider for dynamic denoising/reset decisions and hierarchical kinematic coupling for respecting object structure.

Result: Superior performance and robustness demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation by integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors.

Abstract: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.

TL;DR: A training-free defense method for Large Vision-Language Models that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible but incorrect responses, creating security concerns that need efficient, training-free defenses.

Method: Two-stage detection: 1) quick filtering via image consistency under content-preserving transformations, 2) text-embedding space discrepancy analysis for challenging cases, and 3) agentic consolidation using a powerful LLM when needed to resolve attack-induced divergences by leveraging similarities and differences in multiple responses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining notable efficiency - most clean images skip costly processing, and overhead remains minimal even with numerous adversarial examples.

Conclusion: The proposed defense method effectively protects LVLMs from adversarial attacks through a general, efficient, training-free approach that combines image transformations with intelligent response consolidation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences. A key idea is to consolidate multiple responses, leveraging both their similarities and their differences. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining notable efficiency: most clean images skip costly processing, and even in the presence of numerous adversarial examples, the overhead remains minimal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOCA-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Video-LLMs on physical anomaly detection, separating anomalies into ontological (entity violations) and causal (interaction violations) types, revealing models struggle more with causal reasoning despite improvements in semantic perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs excel at semantic perception but lack predictive world modeling capabilities needed for physically grounded intelligence. The paper aims to address this gap by creating a benchmark that specifically tests physical reasoning through anomaly detection.

Method: The authors introduce HOCA-Bench, which frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens, separating them into ontological anomalies (entity definition/persistence violations) and causal anomalies (physical relation violations). They use state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators to create 1,439 videos with 3,470 QA pairs for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 17 Video-LLMs shows a clear cognitive lag: models perform reasonably on static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle significantly with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity, friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning but don't close the gap.

Conclusion: Current Video-LLM architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws, indicating a fundamental limitation in their ability to model physical causality despite advances in semantic perception.

Abstract: Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.

*Minseo Kim,Minchan Kwon,Dongyeun Lee,Yunho Jeon,Junmo Kim*

TL;DR: ConceptPrism automatically disentangles visual concepts from image-specific residuals in personalized text-to-image generation by comparing images within a set, using reconstruction and exclusion losses without manual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized text-to-image generation suffers from concept entanglement where irrelevant residual information from reference images contaminates the target concept, creating a trade-off between concept fidelity and text alignment. Existing disentanglement approaches rely on manual guidance like linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept.

Method: ConceptPrism automatically disentangles shared visual concepts from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. The method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: (1) reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and (2) a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept, allowing the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: ConceptPrism provides an automatic framework for disentangling visual concepts from image-specific residuals in personalized text-to-image generation, overcoming limitations of manual guidance approaches and improving the fidelity-alignment trade-off.

TL;DR: MVIG attack is a novel adaptive adversarial framework that exploits vulnerabilities in collaborative perception defenses by learning from mutual view information graphs to generate optimized attacks across timing, location, and persistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative perception defenses are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that exploit systematic timing/target optimization and implicit vulnerability disclosure in shared data. There's a need to demonstrate these security gaps to improve CP system robustness.

Method: Proposes MVIG attack framework that: 1) captures vulnerability knowledge from mutual view information graph representation, 2) uses temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps, 3) employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing, and persistence.

Result: MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62% against state-of-the-art defenses, achieves 47% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets, exposing critical security gaps.

Conclusion: The MVIG attack framework demonstrates significant vulnerabilities in current collaborative perception defenses, highlighting the need for more robust security measures in CP systems for connected autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) enables data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance driving safety. However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

TL;DR: CLCR organizes multimodal features into a three-level semantic hierarchy with level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions, preventing semantic misalignment and improving representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods project all modalities into a single latent space, overlooking the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data, which causes semantic misalignment and error propagation that degrades representation quality.

Method: Proposes Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR) with: 1) Semantic hierarchy encoder aligning shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities; 2) Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizing features into shared/private subspaces with learnable token budget; 3) Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizing semantic scales with learned anchors; plus regularization for feature separation.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.

Conclusion: CLCR effectively addresses semantic misalignment in multimodal learning by organizing features into hierarchical semantic levels with constrained cross-modal interactions, leading to improved representation quality and task performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to capture both shared and private information from multiple modalities. However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.

TL;DR: Satellite-based pipeline detects looted archaeological sites in Afghanistan using PlanetScope imagery and deep learning, achieving 0.926 F1 score with ImageNet-pretrained CNNs and spatial masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looting at archaeological sites threatens cultural heritage, but monitoring thousands of remote locations is operationally difficult, requiring scalable automated detection methods.

Method: Developed a satellite-based pipeline using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016-2023). Compared end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches with traditional ML trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and remote-sensing foundation model embeddings.

Result: ImageNet-pretrained CNNs with spatial masking achieved F1 score of 0.926, significantly outperforming traditional ML (0.710 F1). Ablation studies showed ImageNet pretraining and spatial masking enhance performance, while geospatial foundation model embeddings performed competitively with handcrafted features.

Conclusion: Deep learning with ImageNet pretraining and spatial masking provides effective scalable detection of looted archaeological sites from satellite imagery, with looting signatures being extremely localized. The method enables monitoring of remote cultural heritage sites.

Abstract: Looting at archaeological sites poses a severe risk to cultural heritage, yet monitoring thousands of remote locations remains operationally difficult. We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

*Mingxiu Cai,Zhe Zhang,Gaochang Wu,Tianyou Chai,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAID is a retrieval-augmented unsupervised anomaly detection framework that uses hierarchical retrieval and guided MoE networks to suppress matching noise for robust anomaly localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAD methods suffer from noise introduced during template matching due to intra-class variations, imperfect correspondences, and limited templates. The paper aims to address this fundamental challenge by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation principles for noise-resilient anomaly detection.

Method: RAID retrieves class-, semantic-, and instance-level representations from a hierarchical vector database. It uses a matching cost volume to correlate input with retrieved exemplars, followed by a guided Mixture-of-Experts network that adaptively suppresses matching noise to produce fine-grained anomaly maps.

Result: RAID achieves state-of-the-art performance across full-shot, few-shot, and multi-dataset settings on MVTec, VisA, MPDD, and BTAD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully reinterprets UAD through a retrieval-augmented generation lens, introducing a noise-resilient framework that effectively suppresses matching noise for improved anomaly detection and localization.

Abstract: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to identify abnormal regions by establishing correspondences between test images and normal templates. Existing methods primarily rely on image reconstruction or template retrieval but face a fundamental challenge: matching between test images and normal templates inevitably introduces noise due to intra-class variations, imperfect correspondences, and limited templates. Observing that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieved samples directly in the generation process, we reinterpret UAD through this lens and introduce \textbf{RAID}, a retrieval-augmented UAD framework designed for noise-resilient anomaly detection and localization. Unlike standard RAG that enriches context or knowledge, we focus on using retrieved normal samples to guide noise suppression in anomaly map generation. RAID retrieves class-, semantic-, and instance-level representations from a hierarchical vector database, forming a coarse-to-fine pipeline. A matching cost volume correlates the input with retrieved exemplars, followed by a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that leverages the retrieved samples to adaptively suppress matching noise and produce fine-grained anomaly maps. RAID achieves state-of-the-art performance across full-shot, few-shot, and multi-dataset settings on MVTec, VisA, MPDD, and BTAD benchmarks. \href{https://github.com/Mingxiu-Cai/RAID}{https://github.com/Mingxiu-Cai/RAID}.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play module that improves VLMs' rare object reasoning without finetuning, using learned multi-modal class embeddings to refine visual tokens and enrich text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with rare object reasoning due to scarcity in pretraining data. Existing solutions are computationally intensive and don't fully exploit original training data.

Method: Learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects using vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions. Use these embeddings to refine visual tokens via lightweight attention enhancement and generate object-aware hints for text prompts.

Result: Consistent and substantial gains on two benchmarks for rare object recognition and reasoning. Analysis shows improved VLM attention and reasoning about rare objects.

Conclusion: Proposed efficient plug-and-play module effectively enhances VLM performance on rare objects without finetuning, leveraging learned embeddings for both visual token refinement and prompt enrichment.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in broad visual understanding, yet they remain challenged by object-centric reasoning on rare objects due to the scarcity of such instances in pretraining data. While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-Video models focus on visual fidelity rather than instructional effectiveness, creating a need for systems that prioritize pedagogical quality in educational content creation.

Method: Introduces PedaCo-Gen with an Intermediate Representation phase where educators interactively review and refine video blueprints (scripts + visual descriptions) with AI reviewer guidance based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning.

Result: Study with 23 education experts shows PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across topics and CTML principles compared to baselines, with high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04).

Conclusion: The system demonstrates that AI-driven pedagogical guidance can serve as metacognitive scaffolding that augments human expertise, highlighting the importance of principled co-creation that harmonizes generative AI with professional pedagogical agency.

Abstract: While advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generative AI offer a promising path toward democratizing content creation, current models are often optimized for visual fidelity rather than instructional efficacy. This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-H and WOFTSAM are novel planar trackers combining SAM 2's segmentation tracking with homography pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on POT-210 and PlanarTrack benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust planar trackers that can handle target appearance changes and improve re-detection capabilities for lost targets in planar tracking scenarios.

Method: SAM-H estimates 8-DOF homographies from segmentation mask contours using SAM 2. WOFTSAM enhances the WOFT tracker by integrating SAM-H's lost target re-detection capability.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art on both POT-210 and PlanarTrack benchmarks, outperforming second best by +12.4 and +15.2 percentage points on PlanarTrack's p@15 metric. Also provided improved ground-truth annotations for PlanarTrack.

Conclusion: The combination of segmentation-based tracking with homography estimation creates highly robust planar trackers that significantly advance the state-of-the-art in planar tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: We present SAM-H and WOFTSAM, novel planar trackers that combine robust long-term segmentation tracking provided by SAM 2 with 8 degrees-of-freedom homography pose estimation. SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours and is thus highly robust to target appearance changes. WOFTSAM significantly improves the current state-of-the-art planar tracker WOFT by exploiting lost target re-detection provided by SAM-H. The proposed methods are evaluated on POT-210 and PlanarTrack tracking benchmarks, setting the new state-of-the-art performance on both. On the latter, they outperform the second best by a large margin, +12.4 and +15.2pp on the p@15 metric. We also present improved ground-truth annotations of initial PlanarTrack poses, enabling more accurate benchmarking in the high-precision p@5 metric.

### [163] [Localized Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via High-Level Representation Misdirection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19631)
*Uichan Lee,Jeonghyeon Kim,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRM is a concept erasure method for text-to-image diffusion models that misdirects high-level semantic representations in the text encoder's early layers toward designated vectors, enabling precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models pose risks of misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. While concept erasure techniques exist, prior methods focusing on fine-tuning the denoising component may not be optimal. Recent causal tracing studies suggest visual attribute information is localized in early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative approach.

Method: HiRM (High-Level Representation Misdirection) misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors (random directions or semantically defined directions like supercategories). It only updates early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes, using a decoupling strategy for precise concept removal.

Result: HiRM demonstrates strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (objects, styles, nudity). It preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures like Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.

Conclusion: HiRM provides an effective approach to concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models by targeting early text encoder layers, enabling precise concept removal with minimal degradation of unrelated concepts while maintaining model utility and transferability.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedTAR is a federated learning framework for longitudinal medical report generation that addresses temporal evolution of client data through demographic personalization and time-aware aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal medical report generation is challenging due to privacy constraints and evolving disease progression. Existing FL methods overlook temporal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, failing to model temporal shifts across visits or patient heterogeneity.

Method: FedTAR integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. It generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation with updates weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.

Result: Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR show consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization.

Conclusion: FedTAR establishes a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling in medical report generation.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical report generation is clinically important yet remains challenging due to strict privacy constraints and the evolving nature of disease progression. Although federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without data sharing, existing FL methods largely overlook longitudinal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, making them unable to model temporal shifts across visits or patient-specific heterogeneity-ultimately leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal report generation.
  We introduce Federated Temporal Adaptation (FTA), a federated setting that explicitly accounts for the temporal evolution of client data. Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. FedTAR generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation, where updates from different visits are weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.
  Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization, establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.

### [165] [TeHOR: Text-Guided 3D Human and Object Reconstruction with Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19679)
*Hyeongjin Nam,Daniel Sungho Jung,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeHOR framework improves 3D human-object reconstruction from single images by using text descriptions for semantic alignment and appearance cues for holistic context, enabling better handling of non-contact interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human-object reconstruction methods rely too heavily on physical contact information, failing to capture non-contact interactions (like gazing or pointing). They also focus too much on local geometric proximity while neglecting appearance cues that provide important global context for understanding holistic interactions.

Method: TeHOR introduces two core designs: 1) Uses text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between 3D reconstruction and textual cues, enabling reasoning over both contact and non-contact interactions. 2) Incorporates appearance cues of 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information for visually plausible reconstructions.

Result: The framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D human-object reconstruction from single images.

Conclusion: By combining text-based semantic alignment with appearance cues, TeHOR addresses fundamental limitations of existing approaches and enables more comprehensive reconstruction of human-object interactions, including non-contact cases.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image is an active research area, with pivotal applications in robotics and digital content creation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, their reconstructions rely heavily on physical contact information, which inherently cannot capture non-contact human-object interactions, such as gazing at or pointing toward an object. Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases. Second, we incorporate appearance cues of the 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information, thereby ensuring visually plausible reconstructions. As a result, our framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction struggles with over-exposed regions where traditional methods fail due to complete information loss, creating a need for better recovery of details in these challenging areas.

Method: Combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement for inpainting over-exposed areas, using an iterative compensation mechanism that integrates with existing HDR reconstruction methods without requiring training.

Result: Significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures, effectively recovering natural details while preserving existing pipeline advantages.

Conclusion: The training-free diffusion-based approach successfully enhances HDR reconstruction by generating plausible content in over-exposed regions while maintaining luminance coherence across multiple exposures.

Abstract: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction remains challenging for over-exposed regions where traditional methods often fail due to complete information loss. We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures. Results show that our method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving the advantages of existing HDR reconstruction pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid LoRA approach combining class-shared and per-image adapters for few-shot image generation, using semantic boosting and Dirichlet mixture coefficients to achieve both diversity and fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like medical applications and fine-grained settings face data scarcity, especially for tail classes. Existing approaches either capture fine details but lack diversity (image-wise LoRA) or provide diversity but miss details (class-wise LoRA). Need to combine both benefits for reliable models under data scarcity.

Method: Separates adapter into class-shared LoRA A for class priors and per-image LoRAs B for image-specific characteristics. Uses semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training to expose coherent class semantics. For generation, composes A with a mixture of B using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.

Result: Synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution. Achieves robust gains in downstream classification accuracy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid LoRA approach effectively combines the benefits of both image-wise and class-wise adapters, enabling high-quality few-shot image generation that improves downstream task performance in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Beyond general recognition tasks, specialized domains including privacy-constrained medical applications and fine-grained settings often encounter data scarcity, especially for tail classes. To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Across diverse datasets, our synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution, yielding robust gains in downstream classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Establishes reasoning fidelity as quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrates scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. All datasets, models, and code are open-sourced.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models often generate natural-language explanations, yet their reasoning is frequently ungrounded in visual evidence, limiting reliability. Existing evaluations measure classification accuracy but overlook reasoning fidelity. We propose DeepfakeJudge, a framework for scalable reasoning supervision and evaluation, that integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark containing recent generative and editing forgeries, a human-annotated subset with visual reasoning labels, and a suite of evaluation models, that specialize in evaluating reasoning rationales without the need for explicit ground truth reasoning rationales. The Judge is optimized through a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process that scales human feedback into structured reasoning supervision and supports both pointwise and pairwise evaluation. On the proposed meta-evaluation benchmark, our reasoning-bootstrapped model achieves an accuracy of 96.2\%, outperforming \texttt{30x} larger baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have limitations: direct regression struggles with object symmetries, while feature matching fails when objects lack distinctive local features.

Method: Proposes Flose, a generative method that treats pose estimation as conditional flow matching in ℝ³, performing denoising conditioned on local features. Integrates appearance-based semantic features to address symmetry ambiguities and incorporates RANSAC-based registration for outlier handling.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on five BOP benchmark datasets with average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall.

Conclusion: Flose effectively addresses limitations of existing 6D pose estimation methods by combining geometric and appearance features through conditional flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Existing methods for instance-level 6D pose estimation typically rely on neural networks that either directly regress the pose in $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ or estimate it indirectly via local feature matching. The former struggle with object symmetries, while the latter fail in the absence of distinctive local features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel formulation of 6D pose estimation as a conditional flow matching problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark. Flose outperforms prior methods with an average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall. Project Website : https://tev-fbk.github.io/Flose/

TL;DR: PMM-Synth is a personalized MRI synthesis framework that generalizes across multiple clinical datasets for flexible multi-modal MRI synthesis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified MRI synthesis models are typically trained and evaluated on single datasets, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets with different modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions, which hinders practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets using three innovations: 1) Personalized Feature Modulation module that adapts features based on dataset identifier, 2) Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler for stable training under inconsistent modality conditions, and 3) selective supervision loss for effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing.

Result: PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores, with qualitative results showing improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details.

Conclusion: PMM-Synth demonstrates effective cross-dataset generalization for multi-modal MRI synthesis and shows potential for supporting reliable diagnosis in real-world modality-missing scenarios, as evidenced by downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies.

Abstract: Synthesizing missing modalities in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for ensuring diagnostic completeness, particularly when full acquisitions are infeasible due to time constraints, motion artifacts, and patient tolerance. Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios.

TL;DR: VGGT-MPR is a multimodal place recognition framework using Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer as unified geometric engine for camera-LiDAR fusion, featuring depth-aware embeddings and training-free re-ranking for robust autonomous driving localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal place recognition methods rely on hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones requiring costly retraining. Need more efficient and robust approach for autonomous driving localization under environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions.

Method: Uses Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as unified geometric engine. Extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings via depth-aware and point map supervision. Densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps. Features training-free re-ranking using VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability with mask-guided keypoint extraction and confidence-aware correspondence scoring.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and self-collected data. Demonstrates strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions.

Conclusion: VGGT-MPR provides an effective multimodal place recognition framework that combines geometrically-rich feature extraction with efficient training-free re-ranking, offering robust performance for autonomous driving localization tasks.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, robust place recognition is critical for global localization and loop closure detection. While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

*Shoukun Sun,Zhe Wang,Xiang Que,Jiyin Zhang,Xiaogang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfScene-SR enables spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes using diffusion models with guided fusion, eliminating boundary artifacts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion-based SR models (like SR3) are trained on fixed-size patches and struggle with arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Patch-based processing causes visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries.

Method: InfScene-SR adapts iterative refinement of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, enabling seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining.

Result: Validated on remote sensing datasets, InfScene-SR reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality and eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks like semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes using diffusion models, overcoming limitations of patch-based approaches while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) inputs, a task where Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently shown superior performance compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based approaches. However, standard diffusion-based SR models, such as SR3, are typically trained on fixed-size patches and struggle to scale to arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Applying these models via independent patch processing leads to visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries. In this paper, we propose InfScene-SR, a framework enabling spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes. We adapt the iterative refinement process of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, allowing for the seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining. We validate our approach on remote sensing datasets, demonstrating that InfScene-SR not only reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality but also eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

### [173] [RAP: Fast Feedforward Rendering-Free Attribute-Guided Primitive Importance Score Prediction for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19753)
*Kaifa Yang,Qi Yang,Yiling Xu,Zhu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP is a fast, rendering-free method for predicting primitive importance scores in 3D Gaussian Splatting, using intrinsic attributes and local statistics instead of view-dependent rendering analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating primitive importance in 3DGS rely on rendering-based analyses that are view-dependent, computationally expensive, and difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: RAP uses a feedforward, rendering-free approach that infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics. A compact MLP predicts importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization.

Result: After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

Conclusion: RAP provides an efficient, scalable solution for primitive importance estimation in 3DGS that avoids the limitations of rendering-based methods and enables better integration into various 3D processing pipelines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technology for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

*Junhyeok Choi,Sangwoo Mo,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-free multimodal dataset distillation framework using CLIP embeddings and unCLIP decoder for efficient cross-architecture generalization without large-scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning requires large-scale image-text datasets which are costly to train. Existing dataset filtering/pruning methods need large subsets, and optimization-based dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization, limiting cross-architecture generalization.

Method: Proposes a learning-free framework that uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images. Eliminates need for large-scale training and optimization while enabling efficient multimodal dataset distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-free framework provides an efficient and scalable solution for multimodal dataset distillation that enhances generalization across different architectures without requiring costly training or optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks. However, such progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient. Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

*Pengfei Wang,Liyi Chen,Zhiyuan Ma,Yanjun Guo,Guowen Zhang,Lei Zhang*

TL;DR: One2Scene generates explorable 3D scenes from single images by decomposing the problem into panorama generation, 3D scaffold reconstruction via Gaussian Splatting, and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for single-image 3D scene generation struggle with free exploration, producing geometric distortions and artifacts when moving far from the original viewpoint. The problem is ill-posed and challenging.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Generate panorama anchor views from single image, 2) Lift 2D anchors to 3D scaffold using feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network with multi-view stereo matching approach and bidirectional feature fusion, 3) Use scaffold as prior for novel view generator to produce arbitrary camera views.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation. Supports stable immersive scene exploration under large camera motions.

Conclusion: One2Scene effectively solves the challenging problem of explorable 3D scene generation from single images by decomposing it into tractable sub-tasks, enabling photorealistic and geometrically accurate free exploration.

Abstract: Generating explorable 3D scenes from a single image is a highly challenging problem in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle to support free exploration, often producing severe geometric distortions and noisy artifacts when the viewpoint moves far from the original perspective. We introduce \textbf{One2Scene}, an effective framework that decomposes this ill-posed problem into three tractable sub-tasks to enable immersive explorable scene generation. We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration. Extensive experiments show that One2Scene substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation. Code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs focus on global image understanding but struggle to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. There's a need for more intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.

Method: TraceVision uses a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. It employs geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and uses a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. The model is extended to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding with cross-frame tracking.

Conclusion: TraceVision successfully integrates trajectory-aware spatial understanding into vision-language models, enabling more human-like visual attention simulation and interpretable associations between language descriptions and specific image regions.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in image understanding and natural language generation. However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage deep learning framework for automated endometrial carcinoma screening that uses cross-modal image generation from MRI to overcome ultrasound data scarcity, combined with lightweight gradient distillation for efficient myometrial invasion detection in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of myometrial invasion is critical for endometrial carcinoma management, but transvaginal ultrasound screening faces challenges: low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, severe class imbalance, and computational limitations in primary care settings.

Method: 1) Structure-guided cross-modal generation network synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired MRI data while preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. 2) Lightweight screening network using gradient distillation transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to guide sparse attention toward task-critical regions.

Result: Achieved 99.5% sensitivity, 97.2% specificity, and 0.987 AUC on a multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants with minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming expert sonographers' average diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation with knowledge-driven efficient modeling can democratize expert-level, real-time cancer screening for resource-constrained primary care settings.

Abstract: Early detection of myometrial invasion is critical for the staging and life-saving management of endometrial carcinoma (EC), a prevalent global malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\%, a specificity of 97.2\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers. Our approach demonstrates that combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation with knowledge-driven efficient modeling can democratize expert-level, real-time cancer screening for resource-constrained primary care settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline for industrial scenes that uses superpoint merging instead of pre-trained segmentation models, combined with IndustrialCLIP for querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary methods using 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models fail to generalize to industrial environments because they rely on segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes), performing poorly on common industrial objects.

Method: Proposes a training-free pipeline that generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on semantic features instead of using pre-trained instance proposal models. Uses domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" for open-vocabulary querying on 3D industrial workshop scenes.

Result: Qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects, overcoming the generalization limitations of previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free approach with superpoint merging and IndustrialCLIP enables effective open-vocabulary 3D perception in industrial environments without requiring specialized training data.

Abstract: Autonomous vision applications in production, intralogistics, or manufacturing environments require perception capabilities beyond a small, fixed set of classes. Recent open-vocabulary methods, leveraging 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs), target this task but often rely on class-agnostic segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes). In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects. Therefore, we propose a training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline that overcomes this limitation. Instead of using a pre-trained model to generate instance proposals, our method simply generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on their semantic features. Following, we evaluate the domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" on a representative 3D industrial workshop scene for open-vocabulary querying. Our qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextShield-R1: A reinforcement learning-based MLLM for tampered text detection and reasoning that uses forensic continual pre-training, group relative policy optimization, and OCR rectification to improve accuracy while reducing annotation dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, have low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation, creating a need for more effective tampered text detection methods.

Method: 1) Forensic Continual Pre-training using easy-to-hard curriculum with natural image forensic and OCR data; 2) Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions during fine-tuning; 3) OCR Rectification at inference to refine predictions using MLLM's text recognition abilities.

Result: TextShield-R1 significantly advances state-of-the-art in interpretable tampered text detection. The paper also introduces TFR benchmark with 45k+ images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, addressing 7 major limitations of existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed TextShield-R1 framework effectively addresses key challenges in tampered text detection by reducing annotation dependency, improving localization accuracy, and enhancing reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning and OCR integration.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of tampered images poses serious security threats, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3S-Net: A multimodal feature fusion network using multi-scale data and cross-modal Mamba interaction for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting, achieving 6.2% MAE reduction in 10-minute forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal forecasting architectures fail to capture fine-grained cloud optical features and complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities, relying on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation.

Method: 1) Multi-scale partial channel selection network using partial convolutions to isolate boundary features of optically thin clouds; 2) Multi-scale sequence to image analysis network using FFT-based time-frequency representation for meteorological data; 3) Cross-modal Mamba interaction module with dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism to exchange state-space parameters between modalities.

Result: M3S-Net achieves mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed M3S-Net enables deep structural coupling between visual and temporal modalities with linear computational complexity, overcoming limitations of shallow concatenation approaches for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting.

Abstract: The inherent intermittency and high-frequency variability of solar irradiance, particularly during rapid cloud advection, present significant stability challenges to high-penetration photovoltaic grids. Although multimodal forecasting has emerged as a viable mitigation strategy, existing architectures predominantly rely on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation, thereby failing to capture the fine-grained optical features of clouds and the complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes M3S-Net, a novel multimodal feature fusion network based on multi-scale data for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, a multi-scale partial channel selection network leverages partial convolutions to explicitly isolate the boundary features of optically thin clouds, effectively transcending the precision limitations of coarse-grained binary masking. Second, a multi-scale sequence to image analysis network employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation to disentangle the complex periodicity of meteorological data across varying time horizons. Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation. Experimental validation on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset demonstrates that M3S-Net achieves a mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/FGPD.

Result: Outperforms prior method Happy on four benchmarks, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%.

Conclusion: GOAL establishes a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery by enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones.

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) requires identifying novel classes from unlabeled data while retaining knowledge of known classes over time. Existing methods typically update classifier weights dynamically, resulting in forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment. We propose GOAL, a unified framework that introduces a fixed Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to impose a consistent geometric structure throughout learning. GOAL conducts supervised alignment for labeled samples and confidence-guided alignment for novel samples, enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones. Experiments on four benchmarks show that GOAL outperforms the prior method Happy, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%, establishing a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses class imbalance in dermatological datasets through synthetic data generation and enables practical clinical deployment via knowledge distillation for lightweight mobile models.

Abstract: Skin lesion classification datasets often suffer from severe class imbalance, with malignant cases significantly underrepresented, leading to biased decision boundaries during deep learning training. We address this challenge using class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic dermatological images, followed by self-supervised MAE pretraining to enable huge ViT models to learn robust, domain-relevant features. To support deployment in practical clinical settings, where lightweight models are required, we apply knowledge distillation to transfer these representations to a smaller ViT student suitable for mobile devices. Our results show that MAE pretraining on synthetic data, combined with distillation, improves classification performance while enabling efficient on-device inference for practical clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UCD methods rely on predefined assumptions about change types through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or generative models, limiting generalization to rare/complex scenarios.

Method: End-to-end framework that synthesizes diverse changes directly in latent feature space during training, using feature statistics of target data to generate data-driven variations aligned with target domain.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points, and generalizes strongly across diverse change types.

Conclusion: MaSoN addresses generalization limitations of existing UCD methods by generating diverse, data-driven changes in feature space, enabling robust performance across various change types and modalities including SAR.

Abstract: Unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing aims to localise semantic changes between two images of the same region without relying on labelled data during training. Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

Conclusion: Domain-aware training is crucial for developing deployable dermatological image analysis systems. The visual meta-domain adaptation approach successfully addresses domain shift challenges and enhances model performance in clinical settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models for dermatological image analysis remain sensitive to acquisition variability and domain-specific visual characteristics, leading to performance degradation when deployed in clinical settings. We investigate how visual artifacts and domain shifts affect deep learning-based skin lesion classification. We propose an adaptation strategy, grounded in the idea of visual meta-domains, that transfers visual representations from larger dermoscopic datasets into clinical image domains, thereby improving generalization robustness. Experiments across multiple dermatology datasets show consistent gains in classification performance and reduced gaps between dermoscopic and clinical images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns EO foundation models with optical vision foundation models, enabling efficient cross-modal knowledge transfer while maintaining performance on both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation (EO) involves diverse sensors and modalities, making a single universal foundation model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models will coexist, requiring efficient knowledge transfer across modalities. Existing EO pretraining methods (masked image modeling) focus on local reconstruction but lack control over global semantic structure.

Method: Proposes a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework that combines a multispectral teacher with an optical vision foundation model (VFM) teacher. The student model's pretraining objective is aligned with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical VFMs, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks. The model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, with average improvements of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources, enabling effective knowledge transfer between specialized EO foundation models while maintaining performance across modalities.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth Observation (EO), yet the diversity of EO sensors and modalities makes a single universal model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources. Code: Coming soon.

*Qiankun Ma,Ziyao Zhang,Haofei Wang,Jie Chen,Zhen Song,Hairong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ApET is an attention-free visual token compression framework for Vision-Language Models that uses linear approximation and error guidance to identify and drop redundant tokens, achieving high compression rates while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM token compression methods rely on attention mechanisms, which introduce positional bias and are incompatible with efficient attention kernels like FlashAttention, limiting practical deployment for acceleration.

Method: ApET uses linear approximation to reconstruct original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens, then leverages approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens without any attention involvement.

Result: ApET retains 95.2% of original performance on image tasks and 100.4% on video tasks while compressing token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5% respectively, and seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention for further acceleration.

Conclusion: ApET provides an effective attention-free token compression solution that maintains VLM performance while enabling practical deployment through compatibility with efficient attention kernels.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal understanding capabilities, yet the redundant visual tokens incur prohibitive computational overhead and degrade inference efficiency. Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

*Krzysztof Adamkiewicz,Brian Moser,Stanislav Frolov,Tobias Christian Nauen,Federico Raue,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Newer text-to-image models produce worse synthetic training data despite improved visual quality, leading to declining classification accuracy on real test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether advances in text-to-image diffusion models translate to better synthetic training data for vision tasks, challenging the assumption that improved generative realism implies better data realism.

Method: Generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models (2022-2025), train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate on real test data while analyzing distribution characteristics.

Result: Classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models despite their improved visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Models collapse to narrow, aesthetic-centric distributions that undermine diversity and label-image alignment.

Conclusion: Progress in generative realism does not imply progress in data realism. Modern T2I models have limitations as reliable training data generators, requiring rethinking of their capabilities for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models produce visually stunning images and demonstrate excellent prompt following. But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators.

### [188] [BigMaQ: A Big Macaque Motion and Animation Dataset Bridging Image and 3D Pose Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19874)
*Lucas Martini,Alexander Lappe,Anna Bognár,Rufin Vogels,Martin A. Giese*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BigMaQ is a large-scale 3D motion dataset of interacting rhesus macaques with subject-specific avatars, enabling improved action recognition when pose information is integrated with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current animal behavior recognition lacks accurate 3D pose and shape reconstruction, especially for non-human primates where mesh-based tracking lags behind other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that can't fully capture action dynamics.

Method: Created BigMaQ dataset with 750+ scenes of interacting rhesus macaques, constructing subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. Derived BigMaQ500 benchmark linking surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple monkeys, then paired features from image/video encoders with pose descriptors.

Result: Pose descriptions are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. When pose information is included with visual features, substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) are demonstrated for action recognition.

Conclusion: BigMaQ establishes the first dataset that integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into animal action recognition learning, providing a rich resource to advance study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates.

Abstract: The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates. The code and data are publicly available at https://martinivis.github.io/BigMaQ/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers created a 3D parametric model called SaanenGoat for female Saanen dairy goats to enable accurate body measurement from single-view RGBD input, addressing the lack of goat-specific 3D data for assessing milk production potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats is linked to body size, requiring accurate 3D body measurement for milk production assessment. Existing methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data, creating a gap in precision livestock farming applications.

Method: Created FemaleSaanenGoat dataset with synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female goats. Used multi-view DynamicFusion to fuse noisy point clouds into high-fidelity 3D scans. Developed SaanenGoat parametric model with refined template (41 skeletal joints, enhanced udder representation) registered with scan data. Constructed comprehensive shape space from 48 goats to represent individual variations.

Result: Achieved high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input and automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement.

Conclusion: The SaanenGoat model presents a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming, enabling accurate assessment of dairy goat body dimensions for milk production potential evaluation.

Abstract: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats, renowned for their high milk yield, is intrinsically linked to their body size, making accurate 3D body measurement essential for assessing milk production potential, yet existing reconstruction methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data. To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating expressive cinematic portrait videos using a high-fidelity personalized head representation and diffusion transformer, achieving superior identity preservation and expression accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing portrait generation methods using 2D landmarks and parametric models have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details, struggling to preserve subject identity and expressions for high-quality portrait video generation.

Method: Proposes a high-fidelity personalized head representation that disentangles expression and identity, capturing both static global geometry and dynamic expression details. Introduces an expression transfer module for personalized transfer of head pose/expression between identities, and uses this representation to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator.

Result: Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks show the method outperforms previous models in identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.

Conclusion: The proposed high-fidelity personalized head representation combined with diffusion transformer enables generation of highly expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.

Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of robust digital resources for taxonomically challenging parasitoid wasps (Ichneumonoidea) which are ecologically critical for biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management but difficult to identify due to cryptic morphology and many undescribed species.

Method: Created a curated image dataset containing 3,556 high-resolution images primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, supplemented with other families to improve model robustness. A subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format with multi-class bounding boxes for full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars.

Result: The dataset provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these challenging insect families, with comprehensive annotations supporting automated taxonomic identification systems.

Conclusion: This curated image dataset addresses critical gaps in digital resources for Ichneumonoidea identification and enables the development of automated computer vision systems for biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management of these ecologically important parasitoid wasps.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management, particularly for the hyper-diverse superfamily Ichneumonoidea. Comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, these parasitoid wasps are ecologically critical for regulating insect populations, yet they remain one of the most taxonomically challenging groups due to their cryptic morphology and vast number of undescribed species. To address the scarcity of robust digital resources for these key groups, we present a curated image dataset designed to advance automated identification systems. The dataset contains 3,556 high-resolution images, primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, while also including supplementary families such as Andrenidae, Apidae, Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Pompilidae, and Vespidae to improve model robustness. Crucially, a subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format, featuring multi-class bounding boxes for the full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars. This resource provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these families.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel contrastive learning selection strategy for medical images using disease severity labels instead of arbitrary augmentations to improve biomarker classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In medical imaging, traditional contrastive learning uses augmentations that can distort small localized biomarkers. A better approach is to select samples based on disease severity similarity since these share similar disease progression structures.

Method: Generate disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans using gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. Use these labels to train a supervised contrastive learning setup that selects positive/negative pairs based on disease severity similarity.

Result: Improves biomarker classification accuracy by up to 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Conclusion: Disease severity-based selection strategy outperforms traditional augmentation-based contrastive learning for medical images, particularly for detecting biomarkers in OCT scans.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning for medical images. On natural images, contrastive learning uses augmentations to select positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. However, in the medical domain, arbitrary augmentations have the potential to distort small localized regions that contain the biomarkers we are interested in detecting. A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.

*Yeonsung Kim,Junggeun Do,Seunguk Do,Sangmin Kim,Jaesik Park,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEAL-pose is a data-driven framework that uses a learnable loss network to train pose estimation networks by evaluating structural plausibility, outperforming traditional supervised losses and explicit structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised losses for 3D human pose estimation treat joints independently and fail to capture intricate local and global dependencies. Existing structural priors require manual design, are often non-differentiable, and cannot be used as end-to-end training objectives.

Method: Proposes SEAL-pose with a learnable loss-net that trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Uses a joint-graph-based design to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data rather than relying on hand-crafted priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility across all settings. Outperforms models with explicit structural constraints despite not enforcing any such constraints.

Conclusion: SEAL-pose demonstrates that data-driven structural learning through a learnable loss network is more effective than manually designed priors for capturing complex joint dependencies in 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is characterized by intricate local and global dependencies among joints. Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCD approaches rely heavily on inter-modality alignment but lack proper intra-modality alignment, which is crucial for generating desired underlying structure of representation distributions. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes SSR²-GCD framework using Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties, emphasizing intra-modality alignment. Integrates prompt candidates using Vision Language Models' inter-modal alignment for knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed SSR²-GCD framework effectively addresses the intra-modality alignment gap in GCD tasks, leveraging both intra-modality relationships and Vision Language Models' inter-modal alignment to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and unknown categories, with only partial labels given for the known categories, posing a challenging open-set recognition problem. State-of-the-art approaches for GCD task are usually built on multi-modality representation learning, which is heavily dependent upon inter-modality alignment. However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced Gaussian kernel with view-dependent opacity for better specular modeling in 3D Gaussian Splatting, plus error-driven compensation for improved rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is limited by spherical harmonics for color encoding, making it difficult to separate diffuse and specular components and accurately represent complex reflections.

Method: Proposes enhanced Gaussian kernel with view-dependent opacity for explicit specular modeling, error-driven compensation strategy, 2D Gaussian initialization, and adaptive insertion/optimization of enhanced kernels.

Result: Method surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance while achieving greater parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses 3DGS limitations in specular reflection modeling and improves overall rendering quality through enhanced Gaussian kernels and compensation strategies.

Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposes SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network with positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) for improved 3D object pose estimation, especially in challenging scenarios like occlusion and novel shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit fields show promise for object pose estimation but struggle with predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions due to lack of direct observational signals, leading to high uncertainty and inaccurate estimations that hinder learning and performance.

Method: Combines SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network (for point-level attribute estimation with SO(3)-equivariance) with positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy that dynamically determines sampling locations based on input.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets, with significant improvements in challenging scenarios including unseen poses, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved regions by leveraging equivariance and adaptive sampling, leading to superior pose estimation performance in difficult real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Learning neural implicit fields of 3D shapes is a rapidly emerging field that enables shape representation at arbitrary resolutions. Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets. Notably, it demonstrates significant improvements in challenging scenarios, such as objects captured with unseen pose, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed for accurate heat-demand mapping, which is crucial for decarbonizing space heating. There's a need for methods that can work in data-scarce regions.

Method: HeatPrompt uses pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with domain-specific prompts to extract visual attributes (roof age, building density, etc.) from RGB satellite images. These semantic features are combined with basic GIS and building-level features, then fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor to estimate annual heat demand.

Result: The MLP regressor achieves a 93.7% R² uplift and reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to baseline models. Qualitative analysis shows high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones.

Conclusion: HeatPrompt provides a lightweight, zero-shot framework for heat planning in data-scarce regions by leveraging vision-language models and satellite imagery to estimate building heat demand without requiring detailed building-level data.

Abstract: Accurate heat-demand maps play a crucial role in decarbonizing space heating, yet most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed to calculate them. We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage methods (MLLMs for discovery then SAM segmentation) suffer from inaccurate localization, false positives, and missed detections in camouflaged object segmentation.

Method: Proposes DSS mechanism with three modules: 1) Feature-coherent Object Discovery (FOD) generates diverse proposals using visual features, 2) Segmentation module refines proposals via SAM, 3) Semantic-driven Mask Selection (SMS) uses MLLMs to evaluate and select optimal mask from candidates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple COS benchmarks without any training or supervision, especially effective in multiple-instance scenes.

Conclusion: DSS provides an effective progressive refinement framework for zero-shot camouflaged object segmentation that addresses limitations of existing two-stage methods through its discover-segment-select pipeline.

Abstract: Current zero-shot Camouflaged Object Segmentation methods typically employ a two-stage pipeline (discover-then-segment): using MLLMs to obtain visual prompts, followed by SAM segmentation. However, relying solely on MLLMs for camouflaged object discovery often leads to inaccurate localization, false positives, and missed detections. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{D}iscover-\textbf{S}egment-\textbf{S}elect (\textbf{DSS}) mechanism, a progressive framework designed to refine segmentation step by step. The proposed method contains a Feature-coherent Object Discovery (FOD) module that leverages visual features to generate diverse object proposals, a segmentation module that refines these proposals through SAM segmentation, and a Semantic-driven Mask Selection (SMS) module that employs MLLMs to evaluate and select the optimal segmentation mask from multiple candidates. Without requiring any training or supervision, DSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple COS benchmarks, especially in multiple-instance scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StructXLIP improves vision-language alignment by focusing on structural cues (edges) during fine-tuning, enhancing cross-modal retrieval performance through structure-centric losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge-based representations are fundamental for visual understanding but underutilized in vision-language alignment. The paper aims to leverage structural cues across modalities to improve fine-tuning on detail-rich captions, particularly for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Method: Introduces StructXLIP, a fine-tuning paradigm that extracts edge maps (Canny) as visual structure proxies and filters captions to be structure-centric. Uses three structure-centric losses: (1) aligning edge maps with structural text, (2) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (3) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift.

Result: Outperforms current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains. The method serves as a plug-and-play boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches.

Conclusion: By maximizing mutual information between multimodal structural representations, StructXLIP guides models toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment beyond standard CLIP approaches.

Abstract: Edge-based representations are fundamental cues for visual understanding, a principle rooted in early vision research and still central today. We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them "structure-centric". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner.

*Tianyu Wang,Zhiyuan Ma,Qian Wang,Xinyi Zhang,Xinwei Long,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-RIG: A Reinforcement Learning framework using Reflection-based Image Generation to improve spatial reasoning in AI image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models struggle with spatial reasoning - they produce visually impressive images but often lack structural integrity and accurate spatial relationships from prompts.

Method: Proposes RL-RIG with four components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser following Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm. Uses Reflection-GRPO to train VLM Actor for edit prompts and Image Editor for quality improvement.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in controllable and precise spatial reasoning on LAION-SG dataset, using Scene Graph IoU and VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation.

Conclusion: RL-RIG effectively addresses the spatial reasoning dilemma in image generation through a reinforcement learning framework with reflection-based editing, significantly improving spatial accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.

*Christof Leitgeb,Thomas Puchleitner,Max Peter Ronecker,Daniel Watzenig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADE-Net: A lightweight 3D object detection model using 3D projections of 4D Radar tensors that achieves better performance with reduced data size and works well in adverse weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar provides robust perception in adverse weather compared to Camera/Lidar, but existing Radar approaches use sparse point clouds or 2D projections causing information loss. Deep learning can extract richer features from low-level Radar data to improve perception performance.

Method: Proposes a 3D projection method for 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors that reduces data size by 91.9% while preserving Doppler and Elevation features. Introduces RADE-Net with backbone exploiting low/high-level Radar tensor cues using spatial and channel-attention, and decoupled detection heads predicting object center-points in Range-Azimuth domain and regressing rotated 3D bounding boxes.

Result: Achieves 16.7% improvement over baseline and 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models on K-Radar dataset. Outperforms several Lidar approaches in adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D projection method and RADE-Net model effectively leverage rich Radar tensor features for robust 3D object detection, especially valuable in adverse weather conditions where optical sensors struggle.

Abstract: Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net.

*Kairan Zhao,Iurie Luca,Peter Triantafillou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First benchmark of machine unlearning algorithms for Vision Transformers, comparing performance across different VT families, capacities, datasets, and unlearning protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning research has focused on CNNs while Vision Transformers have emerged as strong alternatives, but no benchmarking exists for MU algorithms on VTs. There's a critical need to understand how well existing MU approaches work with transformer architectures for vision tasks.

Method: Benchmarks MU algorithm performance across different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) at different capacities, using various datasets to assess scale/complexity impacts, multiple MU algorithms representing different approaches, and both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Focuses on algorithms leveraging training data memorization and uses unified evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides the first comprehensive benchmarking basis for MU algorithms on Vision Transformers, enabling reproducible and fair comparisons. Characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs and assesses impact of different memorization proxies on performance.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first reference performance baseline for machine unlearning on Vision Transformers, shedding light on how existing algorithms work in VT settings and providing a foundation for future MU algorithm development and evaluation.

Abstract: Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.

### [203] [Token-UNet: A New Case for Transformers Integration in Efficient and Interpretable 3D UNets for Brain Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20008)
*Louis Fabrice Tshimanga,Andrea Zanola,Federico Del Pup,Manfredo Atzori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token-UNet is a 3D medical image segmentation model that combines UNet's convolutional encoder with Transformer attention via TokenLearner/TokenFuser modules, achieving better performance with 33% memory, 10% inference time, and 35% parameters compared to SwinUNETR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers enable global interactions in medical imaging but face computational challenges due to quadratic attention scaling with 3D input resolution. Current models like SwinUNETR are computationally expensive, hindering deployment on common hardware.

Method: Token-UNet maintains UNet's convolutional encoder and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps to pool a preset number of tokens from local/global structures. TokenFuser modules encase Transformers into UNet architecture, reducing computational demands while preserving attention benefits.

Result: Token-UNet reduces memory footprint to 33%, inference time to 10%, and parameters to 35% of SwinUNETR while achieving better average Dice score (87.21% ± 0.35% vs 86.75% ± 0.19%). Tokenization yields interpretable attention maps and effectively encodes task-relevant information.

Conclusion: Token-UNet enables efficient 3D medical image segmentation in constrained computational environments, opening possibilities for more accessible training, fine-tuning, and transfer learning on limited hardware, benefiting the research community.

Abstract: We present Token-UNet, adopting the TokenLearner and TokenFuser modules to encase Transformers into UNets.
  While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input.
  The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution.
  This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames.
  To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures.
  Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).
  This work opens the way to more efficient trainings in contexts with limited computational resources, such as 3D medical imaging. Easing model optimization, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning in limited hardware settings can accelerate and diversify the development of approaches, for the benefit of the research community.

### [204] [Closing the gap in multimodal medical representation alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20046)
*Eleonora Grassucci,Giordano Cicchetti,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based multimodal learning suffers from modality gap in medical domain; proposed modality-agnostic framework closes gap, improving radiology image-text alignment and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors causing sparse/fragmented latent spaces (modality gap). While partially mitigated for standard text-image pairs, this gap remains unresolved in complex multimodal settings like medical domain where alignment between radiology images and clinical text is crucial.

Method: Proposed a modality-agnostic framework that closes the modality gap in medical alignment. The method ensures semantically related representations are more aligned regardless of source modality, specifically enhancing alignment between radiology images and clinical text.

Result: The framework improves cross-modal retrieval and image captioning performance by better aligning radiology images with clinical text representations in the shared latent space.

Conclusion: Modality gap exists in medical multimodal alignment, and the proposed modality-agnostic framework effectively closes this gap, leading to improved semantic alignment and better performance on medical multimodal tasks.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has emerged as the de-facto approach for mapping different modalities into a shared latent space by bringing semantically similar representations closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. However, CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors that negatively impact true semantic alignment, leading to sparse and fragmented latent spaces. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.

### [205] [Decoupling Defense Strategies for Robust Image Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20053)
*Jiahui Chen,Zehang Deng,Zeyu Zhang,Chaoyang Li,Lianchen Jia,Lifeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvMark: A two-stage fine-tuning framework for deep learning-based image watermarking that decouples defense strategies against adversarial, distortion, and regeneration attacks while preserving clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional joint optimization approaches face two key problems: decreased clean accuracy from decoder adversarial training, and limited robustness from simultaneous training against all attack types.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses tailored adversarial training that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while conditionally updating the decoder, moving images to non-attackable regions. Stage 2 addresses distortion/regeneration attacks via direct image optimization with a constrained image loss that balances deviation from cover and previous encoded images, plus quality-aware early stopping.

Result: AdvMark achieves highest image quality and comprehensive robustness with up to 29%, 33%, and 46% accuracy improvements for distortion, regeneration, and adversarial attacks respectively compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling defense strategies through a two-stage approach effectively addresses multiple attack types while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating superior performance in both image quality and robustness against advanced attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image watermarking, while robust against conventional distortions, remains vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\%, 33\% and 46\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively.

### [206] [The Invisible Gorilla Effect in Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20068)
*Harry Anthony,Ziyun Liang,Hermione Warr,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OOD detection methods suffer from "Invisible Gorilla Effect" - detection performance improves when artifacts share visual similarity with model's ROI and drops when they don't, creating a significant bias in OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks perform well on in-distribution data but degrade on OOD data. While OOD detection methods exist, their performance varies by artifact type, and the underlying causes of this variation remain underexplored, particularly why some artifacts are harder to detect than others.

Method: 1) Identified the "Invisible Gorilla Effect" bias where OOD detection performance depends on visual similarity between artifacts and ROI. 2) Annotated artifacts by color in 11,355 images from three public datasets (including ISIC). 3) Generated color-swapped counterfactuals to eliminate dataset bias. 4) Evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks to measure performance drops when artifacts differ from ROI.

Result: Found significant performance drops for most OOD detection methods when artifacts differ from the model's ROI. For example, Mahalanobis Score achieved 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) vs. black ink (dissimilar) annotations in a skin lesion classifier. The effect was consistent across multiple methods and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The "Invisible Gorilla Effect" reveals a previously overlooked failure mode in OOD detection where detection performance is biased by visual similarity between artifacts and ROI. This provides important guidance for developing more robust OOD detectors that should account for this bias.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks achieve high performance in vision tasks by learning features from regions of interest (ROI) within images, but their performance degrades when deployed on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that differs from training data. This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticNVS improves novel view synthesis by integrating pre-trained semantic features to handle long-range camera motion, reducing distortions and improving consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NVS methods degrade under long-range camera motion, producing semantically implausible and distorted images due to insufficient scene understanding.

Method: Integrates pre-trained semantic feature extractors using two strategies: (1) warped semantic features and (2) alternating understanding/generation at each denoising step.

Result: Shows clear qualitative and quantitative improvements (4.69%-15.26% in FID) over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating stronger scene semantics via pre-trained features significantly improves NVS quality and consistency, especially for distant viewpoints.

Abstract: We present SemanticNVS, a camera-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for novel view synthesis (NVS), which improves generation quality and consistency by integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors. Existing NVS methods perform well for views near the input view, however, they tend to generate semantically implausible and distorted images under long-range camera motion, revealing severe degradation. We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints. We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the clear qualitative and quantitative (4.69%-15.26% in FID) improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about and enforce visualization principles, comparing them against symbolic constraint-based systems using Answer Set Programming ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While constraint-based systems can encode visualization principles as logical rules, they require expert knowledge for formal specification. The authors want to explore whether LLMs and VLMs can serve as flexible principle checkers that bypass the need for symbolic rule specification.

Method: Created a controlled dataset of ~2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, plus over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. Used Answer Set Programming (ASP) to generate hard verification ground truth. Evaluated both checking (detecting violations) and fixing (correcting flawed charts) tasks across LLMs and VLMs.

Result: Frontier models show promise as flexible validators and editors but have a persistent gap with symbolic solvers on nuanced visual perception aspects. An interesting asymmetry was found: models tend to be better at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.

Conclusion: Large (vision-)language models show potential as visualization principle checkers and editors, but still lag behind symbolic systems on certain aspects. The asymmetry between detection and correction capabilities suggests interesting directions for future model development.

Abstract: Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While constraint-based systems like Draco provide precise automated checks for visualization rules, they require expert effort to maintain symbolic encodings. This motivates exploring LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators that can reason about visualization rules directly.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth from Answer Set Programming (ASP). Translated Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and created a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications with explicit rule violations. Evaluated LLMs on accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence (structured format compliance).

Result: Frontier models achieved high adherence (Gemma 3 4B/27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detected common violations (F1 up to 0.82). However, performance dropped significantly for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs from technical ASP formulations. Translating constraints to natural language improved smaller models' performance by up to 150%.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as flexible, language-driven validators for visualization rules but have current limitations compared to symbolic solvers, particularly for subtle perceptual rules and technical constraint formulations.

Abstract: Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D reconstruction systems require dense geometry and pose supervision which is expensive and scarce, especially for dynamic real-world scenes. There's a need for scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos.

Method: Flow3r uses factored flow prediction: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one image and pose latents from the other. This factorization guides learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and extends to dynamic scenes.

Result: Factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs, scales consistently with unlabeled data, and achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks for static and dynamic scenes. Largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.

Conclusion: Flow3r demonstrates that factored flow prediction enables scalable 3D/4D reconstruction from unlabeled videos, particularly effective for dynamic scenes where supervision is limited.

Abstract: Current feed-forward 3D/4D reconstruction systems rely on dense geometry and pose supervision -- expensive to obtain at scale and particularly scarce for dynamic real-world scenes. We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.

Conclusion: tttLRM demonstrates an effective approach for scalable 3D reconstruction with linear complexity, supporting both feedforward and progressive reconstruction through TTT layers and implicit-to-explicit representation learning.

Abstract: We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence.

Method: Uses Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP) with depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment to fuse vision-language features with diffusion generator efficiently. Trained on few million samples with novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer) post-training.

Result: Achieves 74% on GenEval, outperforms Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11% while running 6x and 11x faster. For visual understanding, surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% across seven benchmarks. Runs ~3s per 512x512 image on iPhone.

Conclusion: Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices, enabling future research in on-device multimodal intelligence without cloud dependency.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency.

### [213] [Triggering hallucinations in model-based MRI reconstruction via adversarial perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18536)
*Suna Buğday,Yvan Saeys,Jonathan Peck*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Generative models for medical image reconstruction are vulnerable to adversarial noise that induces hallucinations, which can't be detected by traditional quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models improve medical imaging quality but are susceptible to hallucinations that insert false features, potentially leading to incorrect diagnoses and endangering patient health.

Method: Crafted adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for unprocessed input images to induce hallucinations in reconstructions. Evaluated on brain and knee images from fastMRI dataset using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures.

Result: Models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. These hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics.

Conclusion: This fragility may explain why hallucinations occur, suggesting adversarial training could reduce their prevalence. Novel approaches are needed to detect when hallucinations have occurred in medical image reconstruction.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used to improve the quality of medical imaging, such as reconstruction of magnetic resonance images and computed tomography. However, it is well-known that such models are susceptible to hallucinations: they may insert features into the reconstructed image which are not actually present in the original image. In a medical setting, such hallucinations may endanger patient health as they can lead to incorrect diagnoses. In this work, we aim to quantify the extent to which state-of-the-art generative models suffer from hallucinations in the context of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Specifically, we craft adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for the unprocessed input images which induce hallucinations when reconstructed using a generative model. We perform this evaluation on the brain and knee images from the fastMRI data set using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures to reconstruct the images. Our results show that these models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. This fragility may partially explain why hallucinations occur in the first place and suggests that a carefully constructed adversarial training routine may reduce their prevalence. Moreover, these hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics. Novel approaches will therefore need to be developed to detect when hallucinations have occurred.

*Tristan Beruard,Armand Delbos,Arthur Chavignon,Maxence Reberol,Vincent Hingot*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 4D U-Net approach improves clutter filtering for transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound by leveraging spatial-temporal information to enhance microbubble detection in low SNR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcranial ultrasound imaging faces limitations due to high skull absorption, restricting vascular imaging to only large vessels. Traditional clutter filters fail in low SNR ultrasound datasets where blood and tissue signals are hard to separate, even with contrast agents.

Method: Novel 4D U-Net approach for clutter filtering in transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) that exploits both spatial and temporal information through a 4D-UNet implementation to enhance microbubble detection in human adult transcranial data.

Result: The 4D-UNet improves performance over traditional temporal clutter filters, offering better clutter rejection and visualization in transcranial CEUS imaging.

Conclusion: Integration of deep learning into CEUS advances neurovascular imaging, demonstrating AI-driven approaches can enhance ultrasound-based medical imaging for more accurate diagnostics and broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is limited by high skull absorption, limiting vascular imaging to only the largest vessels. Traditional clutter filters struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ultrasound datasets, where blood and tissue signals cannot be easily separated, even when the echogenicity of the blood is improved with contrast agents. Here, we present a novel 4D U-Net approach for clutter filtering in transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) exploiting spatial and temporal information via a 4D-UNet implementation to enhance microbubble detection in transcranial data acquired in human adults. Our results show that the 4D-UNet improves temporal clutter filters. By integrating deep learning into CEUS, this study advances neurovascular imaging, offering improved clutter rejection and visualization. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven approaches to enhance ultrasound-based medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate diagnostics and broader clinical applications.

*Jiayang Shi,Daniel M. Pelt,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM4CT is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating diffusion models in CT reconstruction, addressing practical challenges like noise, artifacts, and system geometry that make diffusion models harder to apply than in natural image domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models show promise as priors for inverse problems, CT reconstruction presents unique practical challenges including correlated noise, artifact structures, system geometry dependencies, and misaligned value ranges that make direct application difficult. There's a need to systematically evaluate diffusion models against established reconstruction methods in realistic CT scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce DM4CT benchmark with datasets from medical and industrial domains featuring sparse-view and noisy configurations. They also acquire a high-resolution CT dataset from a synchrotron facility for real experimental evaluation. The benchmark compares 10 recent diffusion-based methods against 7 strong baselines including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches.

Result: The benchmark provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available, and the codebase is open-sourced for community use.

Conclusion: DM4CT establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for diffusion models in CT reconstruction, addressing practical deployment challenges and providing systematic comparison with traditional methods. The benchmark enables better understanding of diffusion model performance in realistic CT scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While computed tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark ten recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at zenodo.org/records/15420527, and the codebase is open-sourced at github.com/DM4CT/DM4CT.

*Abdullah All Tanvir,Agnibh Dasgupta,Xin Zhong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: TIACam is a text-anchored invariant feature learning framework with auto-augmentation for camera-robust zero-watermarking that handles complex optical degradations from camera recapture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera recapture introduces complex optical degradations like perspective warping, illumination shifts, and Moiré interference that challenge existing deep watermarking systems. There's a need for robust watermarking that can survive these real-world camera distortions.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) learnable auto-augmentor with differentiable geometric, photometric, and Moiré operators; (2) text-anchored invariant feature learner with cross-modal adversarial alignment between image and text; (3) zero-watermarking head that binds binary messages in invariant feature space without modifying pixels.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world camera captures show TIACam achieves state-of-the-art feature stability and watermark extraction accuracy, establishing a bridge between multimodal invariance learning and physically robust zero-watermarking.

Conclusion: TIACam provides a unified framework that jointly optimizes invariance, semantic alignment, and watermark recoverability, offering a principled solution for camera-robust zero-watermarking that handles complex optical degradations.

Abstract: Camera recapture introduces complex optical degradations, such as perspective warping, illumination shifts, and Moiré interference, that remain challenging for deep watermarking systems. We present TIACam, a text-anchored invariant feature learning framework with auto-augmentation for camera-robust zero-watermarking. The method integrates three key innovations: (1) a learnable auto-augmentor that discovers camera-like distortions through differentiable geometric, photometric, and Moiré operators; (2) a text-anchored invariant feature learner that enforces semantic consistency via cross-modal adversarial alignment between image and text; and (3) a zero-watermarking head that binds binary messages in the invariant feature space without modifying image pixels. This unified formulation jointly optimizes invariance, semantic alignment, and watermark recoverability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world camera captures demonstrate that TIACam achieves state-of-the-art feature stability and watermark extraction accuracy, establishing a principled bridge between multimodal invariance learning and physically robust zero-watermarking.

### [217] [Automated Disentangling Analysis of Skin Colour for Lesion Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19055)
*Wenbo Yang,Eman Rezk,Walaa M. Moursi,Zhou Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework for disentangling skin colour in dermatology images to address performance degradation when skin colour differs between training and deployment, enabling counterfactual editing and colour normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models for skin images suffer performance degradation when skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment due to entangled environmental and intrinsic factors that cannot be described by a single "skin tone" scalar.

Method: Proposes a skin-colour disentangling framework using disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. Includes randomized monotonic decolourization to prevent information leakage of dark colour features, and geometry-aligned post-processing to suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns.

Result: Enables faithful counterfactual editing to answer "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", direct colour transfer between images, controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (blood perfusion, camera white balance), and educational visualization. Dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization achieve competitive lesion classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses skin colour mismatch in dermatology images through disentanglement, enabling robust counterfactual editing, colour manipulation, and improved classification performance through dataset augmentation and normalization.

Abstract: Machine-learning models working on skin images often have degraded performance when the skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment. Such differences arise from entangled environmental factors (e.g., illumination, camera settings), and intrinsic factors (e.g., skin tone) that cannot be accurately described by a single "skin tone" scalar. To mitigate such colour mismatch, we propose a skin-colour disentangling framework that adapts disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. To prevent information leakage that hinders proper learning of dark colour features, we introduce a randomized, mostly monotonic decolourization mapping. To suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns (e.g., ink marks, scars) during colour manipulation, we further propose a geometry-aligned post-processing step. Together, these components enable faithful counterfactual editing and answering an essential question: "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", as well as direct colour transfer between images and controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (e.g., blood perfusion, camera white balance), enabling educational visualization of skin conditions under varying SCCI. We demonstrate that dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization based on our framework achieve competitive lesion classification performance.

*Wen-Liang Lin,Yun-Chien Cheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Transformer-based UDA framework for PE segmentation using Mean-Teacher with three modules to improve pseudo-label reliability and handle domain shift in CTPA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of deep learning for PE diagnosis in CTPA is hindered by domain shift between medical centers and high annotation costs, requiring robust unsupervised domain adaptation methods.

Method: Transformer backbone with Mean-Teacher architecture for UDA, featuring: (1) Prototype Alignment for category-level distribution matching, (2) Global and Local Contrastive Learning for pixel-level and semantic feature learning, (3) Attention-based Auxiliary Local Prediction for small lesion sensitivity using Transformer attention maps.

Result: Significant improvements in cross-center tasks: FUMPE→CAD-PE IoU increased from 0.1152 to 0.4153; CAD-PE→FUMPE IoU improved from 0.1705 to 0.4302. Achieved 69.9% Dice score in CT→MRI cross-modality task without target labels.

Conclusion: The proposed UDA framework effectively addresses domain shift in PE segmentation, demonstrating strong performance gains and generalizability across different clinical environments without requiring target-domain annotations.

Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated considerable promise in computer-aided diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE), practical deployment in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is often hindered by "domain shift" and the prohibitive cost of expert annotations. To address these challenges, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework is proposed, utilizing a Transformer backbone and a Mean-Teacher architecture for cross-center semantic segmentation. The primary focus is placed on enhancing pseudo-label reliability by learning deep structural information within the feature space. Specifically, three modules are integrated and designed for this task: (1) a Prototype Alignment (PA) mechanism to reduce category-level distribution discrepancies; (2) Global and Local Contrastive Learning (GLCL) to capture both pixel-level topological relationships and global semantic representations; and (3) an Attention-based Auxiliary Local Prediction (AALP) module designed to reinforce sensitivity to small PE lesions by automatically extracting high-information slices from Transformer attention maps. Experimental validation conducted on cross-center datasets (FUMPE and CAD-PE) demonstrates significant performance gains. In the FUMPE -> CAD-PE task, the IoU increased from 0.1152 to 0.4153, while the CAD-PE -> FUMPE task saw an improvement from 0.1705 to 0.4302. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a 69.9% Dice score in the CT -> MRI cross-modality task on the MMWHS dataset without utilizing any target-domain labels for model selection, confirming its robustness and generalizability for diverse clinical environments.

### [219] [On the Dynamics of Observation and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18494)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that semantics emerges from physical constraints on bounded agents, not from static geometric representations. It proposes that symbolic structure is a thermodynamic necessity for intelligent systems operating within finite resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the dominant paradigm in visual intelligence that treats semantics as static geometric properties of latent representations. The authors argue this view is physically incomplete because it ignores the physical constraints of real-world agents (finite memory, compute, energy) interacting with high-entropy environments.

Method: The authors formalize agent-environment interaction through an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory data (fiber) projects onto a low-entropy causal semantic manifold (base). They apply Landauer's Principle to show thermodynamic costs impose limits on internal state transitions (Semantic Constant B). From these constraints, they derive the necessity of symbolic structure through phase transitions in the semantic manifold.

Result: The key result is that to model a combinatorial world within thermodynamic bound B, the semantic manifold must crystallize into discrete, compositional, and factorized form. This demonstrates that language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities - the "solid state" of information required to prevent thermal collapse in bounded agents.

Conclusion: Understanding is not about recovering hidden latent variables, but constructing causal quotients that make the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable. Symbolic structure emerges as a physical necessity for intelligent systems operating under thermodynamic constraints.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

*Zhiqin Qian,Ryan Diaz,Sangwon Seo,Vaibhav Unhelkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRDL extends reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents, with L2HR as a solution that enables AI agents to better adhere to human specifications while completing tasks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Humans care not only about whether tasks are completed but also how they are performed, and existing reward design methods are too limited to capture nuanced human preferences in long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL) problem formulation that extends classical reward design for hierarchical RL agents, and proposes Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL.

Result: Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HRDL and L2HR advance research on human-aligned AI agents by enabling more nuanced alignment of AI behavior with human specifications through improved reward design for hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Abstract: When training artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks, humans often care not only about whether a task is completed but also how it is performed. As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.

*Michal Töpfer,František Plášil,Tomáš Bureš,Petr Hnětynka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using vibe coding feedback loops with LLMs to generate Adaptation Managers for CAS systems, verified via novel FCL temporal logic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in CAS adaptation is defining dynamic architecture and behavior changes. With advances in generative LLMs, there's an opportunity to generate Adaptation Manager code from specifications, but ensuring correctness is difficult. Vibe coding offers iterative testing feedback loops as an alternative to direct code inspection.

Method: Combine adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where LLMs generate AM code based on system specifications and desired behavior. Use novel FCL temporal logic to precisely formulate functional requirements as constraints. Iteratively test generated AMs, feeding LLMs with detailed violation reports of FCL constraints until requirements are met.

Result: Good results generating AMs for two example CAS systems. Typically only a few feedback loop iterations needed, each providing LLM with detailed constraint violation reports. Achieved high run path coverage through different initial settings.

Conclusion: Generating Adaptation Managers via vibe coding feedback loops is viable when verification uses precise FCL temporal logic constraints. The approach successfully combines adaptation and vibe coding loops with detailed constraint violation feedback to LLMs.

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

TL;DR: GEARS is a framework that reframes ranking optimization as autonomous discovery using specialized agent skills, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent while maintaining production reliability through validation hooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in large-scale ranking systems is bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint - the difficult process of translating ambiguous product intent into executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone.

Method: GEARS uses Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, creating an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. It incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies.

Result: Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces shows GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.

Conclusion: GEARS successfully addresses the engineering bottleneck in ranking systems by enabling autonomous optimization through agentic reasoning and validation mechanisms, providing a practical framework for modern ranking challenges.

Abstract: Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.

### [223] [Spilled Energy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18671)
*Adrian Robert Minut,Hazem Dewidar,Iacopo Masi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper reinterprets LLM softmax classifier as Energy-Based Model to detect hallucinations via training-free energy spill metrics from output logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods often require trained probe classifiers or activation ablations, which adds complexity and training overhead. There's a need for simpler, training-free approaches that can detect factual errors, biases, and failures directly from model outputs.

Method: Reinterpret final LLM softmax classifier as Energy-Based Model, decomposing sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs. Introduce two training-free metrics: (1) spilled energy (discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps), and (2) marginalized energy (measurable at single step). Both derived directly from output logits without probes or ablations.

Result: Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma) and synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3). Approach demonstrates robust hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without training overhead.

Conclusion: Energy spill metrics provide effective, training-free hallucination detection that correlates with factual errors and biases. Method generalizes across models and tasks while maintaining simplicity and avoiding additional training requirements.

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

*Martin Bertran,Riccardo Fogliato,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI analysts built on LLMs can cheaply reproduce the analytic diversity seen in human many-analyst studies, showing that different AI configurations produce conflicting conclusions from the same data and hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional many-analyst studies require extensive coordination among human researchers to demonstrate how analytic decisions affect conclusions, but this process is costly and time-consuming. The authors aim to show that AI systems can replicate this structured analytic diversity more efficiently.

Method: The researchers created autonomous AI analysts using large language models (LLMs) to test pre-specified hypotheses on fixed datasets. They varied the underlying LLM models and prompt framing across replicate runs, with each AI analyst independently constructing and executing a full analysis pipeline. An AI auditor then screened each run for methodological validity.

Result: Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analysts produced analyses with wide dispersion in effect sizes, p-values, and binary decisions about hypothesis support, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis was judged supported. This dispersion was structured and systematic across different LLM and persona conditions, and the effects were steerable by reassigning analyst persona or LLM.

Conclusion: AI analysts can cheaply and at scale reproduce the analytic diversity observed in human many-analyst studies, demonstrating that research conclusions depend not just on data but on analytic decisions that are often implicit. The steerability of outcomes by AI configuration raises important questions about transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research.

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

*Dayang Liang,Ruihan Liu,Lipeng Wan,Yunlong Liu,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TEB introduces a task-aware exploration method for visual RL with sparse rewards by combining task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive bisimulation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL faces challenges with sparse rewards due to task-irrelevant variations. Existing intrinsic exploration methods either need low-dimensional states or lack task-aware strategies, making them fragile in visual domains.

Method: TEB uses a predictive bisimulation metric to learn task-relevant representations and measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty. It addresses representation collapse under sparse rewards with a predicted reward differential, then designs potential-based exploration bonuses measuring relative novelty of adjacent observations in latent space.

Result: Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

Conclusion: TEB successfully bridges the gap in visual RL exploration by tightly coupling task-relevant representations with exploration through a robust bisimulation metric, enabling effective task-aware exploration in sparse reward settings.

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework effectively addresses the limitation of current chart summarization methods by generating insightful summaries that capture the deeper meaning of data visualizations, supported by a new high-quality benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

TL;DR: LaDa is a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation that addresses bidirectional model learnability gaps and domain-agnostic reasoning transfer in federated LLM-SLM collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data allocation methods fail to address two key challenges in federated LLM-SLM collaboration: 1) bidirectional model learnability gap where SLMs can't identify high-reward samples matching their constraints and LLMs struggle to select novel knowledge samples, and 2) domain-agnostic reasoning transfer where existing methods can't adapt to local domain data.

Method: Proposes LaDa framework with two components: 1) model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on learnability gaps between SLM-LLM pairs, and 2) domain adaptive reasoning distillation that aligns reasoning path probabilities through contrastive distillation learning on filtered samples.

Result: LaDa effectively facilitates bidirectional knowledge transfer and enables SLMs to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. It operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks.

Conclusion: LaDa addresses critical limitations in federated LLM-SLM collaboration by introducing learnability-aware data allocation and domain-adaptive reasoning distillation, enabling more effective knowledge transfer and reasoning pattern acquisition.

Abstract: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SGD and MCP converge as unified schema-based paradigms for LLM-agent interaction, revealing 5 design principles for deterministic, auditable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish that Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction, and to extract foundational design principles from their convergence.

Method: Analyzing the convergence between SGD (designed for dialogue-based API discovery) and MCP (de facto standard for LLM-tool integration) to extract common insights about schema design for operational constraints and reasoning guidance.

Result: Identified 5 foundational schema design principles: 1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, 2) Explicit Action Boundaries, 3) Failure Mode Documentation, 4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and 5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. Revealed three novel insights about SGD's soundness, unexploited gaps, and progressive disclosure for scaling.

Conclusion: Schema-driven governance provides scalable AI system oversight without proprietary inspection, positioning it as central to Software 3.0, with concrete design patterns enabling deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interactions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

### [229] [LAMMI-Pathology: A Tool-Centric Bottom-Up LVLM-Agent Framework for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18773)
*Haoyang Su,Shaoting Zhang,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAMMI-Pathology is a scalable agent framework for pathology image analysis that uses domain-specific tools, hierarchical coordination, and trajectory-aware fine-tuning to enable molecularly informed medical intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pathology image analysis uses coarse-grained text-image approaches, while emerging spatial transcriptomics technologies enable molecularly validated diagnosis. There's a need for evidence-driven, tool-calling agent systems that can leverage these molecular insights for more accurate pathology analysis.

Method: The framework uses a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture with domain-adaptive tools clustered into component agents. These are coordinated through a hierarchical top-level planner to avoid context length issues. The system introduces Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs) for constructing semi-simulated reasoning trajectories, and uses trajectory-aware fine-tuning to align the planner's decision-making with multi-step reasoning.

Result: The paper proposes LAMMI-Pathology as a scalable agent framework that enhances inference robustness in pathology understanding and enables adaptive use of customized toolsets through its novel trajectory construction and fine-tuning mechanisms.

Conclusion: LAMMI-Pathology represents an advancement in pathology analysis by combining tool-calling agent systems with molecular insights from spatial transcriptomics, offering a more evidence-driven, scalable approach to medical intelligence in pathology.

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

TL;DR: GenPlanner uses generative models (diffusion/flow matching) for path planning in mazes, generating trajectories iteratively from noise conditioned on environment structure, outperforming CNN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning in complex environments requires understanding both geometry and global structure, which is challenging for traditional methods. The authors explore generative models as planning mechanisms to address this problem.

Method: Proposes GenPlanner approach with two variants: DiffPlanner (diffusion models) and FlowPlanner (flow matching). Uses multi-channel conditioning (obstacle map, start/destination points) to generate trajectories iteratively from random noise to correct solutions.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms baseline CNN models. FlowPlanner shows particularly high performance even with limited generation steps.

Conclusion: Generative models (especially flow matching) are effective for path planning tasks, offering iterative refinement from noise to solutions while leveraging environmental structure through conditioning.

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

*Serafim Batzoglou*

TL;DR: ABD is a benchmark for default-exception abduction in finite first-order worlds where models must find sparse exception formulas to restore satisfiability, with three observation regimes and SMT verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to perform default-exception abduction - a core reasoning task involving finding minimal exceptions to restore consistency in logical theories.

Method: Formalize three observation regimes (closed-world, existential completion, universal completion) with exact SMT verification. Evaluate ten frontier LLMs on 600 instances, measuring validity and parsimony of exception formulas.

Result: Best models achieve high validity but show parsimony gaps. Holdout evaluation reveals distinct generalization failure modes across different observation regimes.

Conclusion: The ABD benchmark reveals current LLMs' limitations in default-exception abduction, particularly in finding sparse exceptions and generalizing across different observation regimes, highlighting areas for improvement in logical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce ABD, a benchmark for default-exception abduction over finite first-order worlds. Given a background theory with an abnormality predicate and a set of relational structures, a model must output a first-order formula that defines exceptions, restoring satisfiability while keeping exceptions sparse. We formalize three observation regimes (closed-world, existential completion, universal completion) with exact SMT verification. Evaluating ten frontier LLMs on 600 instances, the best models achieve high validity but parsimony gaps remain, and holdout evaluation reveals distinct generalization failure modes across regimes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TPRU introduces a large-scale dataset and RL fine-tuning method to enhance temporal reasoning in multimodal LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller, deployable MLLMs lack temporal and procedural understanding for real-world embodied AI applications due to insufficient training data with procedural coherence.

Method: Created TPRU dataset from embodied scenarios (robotics, GUI navigation) with three temporal reasoning tasks and negative samples, plus RL fine-tuning for resource-efficient models.

Result: TPRU-7B accuracy improved from 50.33% to 75.70% on TPRU-Test, outperforming larger baselines including GPT-4o, with effective generalization to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: TPRU addresses the temporal reasoning gap in MLLMs through systematic dataset design and RL fine-tuning, enabling better embodied AI capabilities in deployable models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

TL;DR: Researchers use ChatGPT-5.2 to prove a mathematical conjecture about 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrices, showing LLMs can assist in high-level proof search but human verification remains essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how consumer LLMs can assist in research-level mathematics, particularly for individual researchers, by testing their effectiveness in proving mathematical conjectures.

Method: Used ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) with seven shareable threads and four versioned proof drafts, implementing an iterative "generate, referee, and repair" pipeline to resolve Conjecture 20 about nonreal spectral regions.

Result: Successfully proved the conjecture, establishing necessary and sufficient region conditions with explicit boundary attainment constructions, while documenting where LLM assistance was most useful and where human verification was critical.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for high-level proof search in mathematics, but human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure; the study provides insights for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DREAM is an agentic evaluation framework for deep research agents that addresses the "Mirage of Synthesis" problem by using tool-calling agents to assess temporal validity and factual correctness, outperforming static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating deep research agents suffer from the "Mirage of Synthesis" - strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can mask underlying factual and reasoning defects. Static evaluators lack the tool-use capabilities needed to assess temporal validity and factual correctness.

Method: DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics) implements capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. It uses an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes.

Result: Controlled evaluations show DREAM is significantly more sensitive to factual and temporal decay than existing benchmarks, offering a scalable, reference-free evaluation paradigm.

Conclusion: DREAM addresses critical gaps in evaluating deep research agents by introducing agentic evaluation with tool-calling capabilities, providing better detection of factual and temporal defects than static benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents generate analyst-grade reports, yet evaluating them remains challenging due to the absence of a single ground truth and the multidimensional nature of research quality. Recent benchmarks propose distinct methodologies, yet they suffer from the Mirage of Synthesis, where strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can obscure underlying factual and reasoning defects. We characterize this gap by introducing a taxonomy across four verticals that exposes a critical capability mismatch: static evaluators inherently lack the tool-use capabilities required to assess temporal validity and factual correctness. To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. DREAM structures assessment through an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes. Controlled evaluations demonstrate DREAM is significantly more sensitive to factual and temporal decay than existing benchmarks, offering a scalable, reference-free evaluation paradigm.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG), a framework that treats non-geometric gameplay dimensions (like mechanics and temporal dynamics) as first-class coordinates alongside spatial geometry, enabling more controllable and expressive level generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PCG methods focus primarily on static 2D/3D geometry while treating gameplay mechanics as auxiliary, which limits controllability and expressivity. The authors argue for elevating non-geometric gameplay dimensions to equal importance with spatial coordinates.

Method: Two concrete instantiations: 1) Direction-Space adds a discrete layer dimension (4D: x,y,z,l) for mechanics like gravity inversion and parallel-world switching; 2) Direction-Time adds temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs for action semantics and conflict rules. Both use a shared pipeline: abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation.

Result: Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of the problem formulation and effectiveness on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that align with the proposed metrics.

Conclusion: HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

### [236] [(Perlin) Noise as AI coordinator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18947)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using continuous noise fields (like Perlin noise) as AI coordinators for large-scale NPC control in games, providing spatially/temporally coherent randomness that balances natural behavior with coordinated variety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current game AI systems struggle to balance smooth natural behavior with coordinated variety across space and time. Handcrafted rules lead to mechanical synchrony, while purely stochastic approaches create uncorrelated noise that's hard to tune.

Method: A three-layer framework using continuous noise fields as AI coordinators: 1) behavior parameterization for agent movement, 2) action time scheduling for behavior timing, and 3) spawn/event type and feature generation for content placement.

Result: Perlin noise as coordinator provides stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime compared to random, filtered, deterministic, and physics-inspired baselines.

Conclusion: Continuous noise fields offer a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality in game AI, motivating broader exploration of coordinated noise for large-scale NPC control.

Abstract: Large scale control of nonplayer agents is central to modern games, while production systems still struggle to balance several competing goals: locally smooth, natural behavior, and globally coordinated variety across space and time. Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime. We hope this work motivates a broader exploration of coordinated noise in game AI as a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to synthesize logical concepts from finite relational data, testing their capacity for concept generalization beyond simple pattern matching.

Method: Created INDUCTION benchmark with three regimes: FullObs (full observation), CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion). Models must output single first-order logic formulas explaining target predicates across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking and formula bloat penalization.

Result: Found sharp difficulty gradients across tasks, identified persistent hard structural families, and discovered that low-bloat formulas generalize significantly better on held-out worlds. Elite models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks, suggesting diverse concept generalization strategies.

Conclusion: INDUCTION provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating concept synthesis capabilities, revealing important insights about formula complexity, generalization performance, and different AI model strategies for logical concept learning.

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

*Alessandro Salatiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that modularity is a fundamental principle for efficient learning and generalization in both biological and artificial intelligence, yet remains underappreciated in mainstream AI research despite its demonstrated benefits across multiple fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems require unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy compared to human intelligence, highlighting the need for new guiding principles inspired by brain computation. Modularity is identified as a key organizational principle that supports efficient learning and strong generalization in humans, and aligns with the No Free Lunch Theorem's requirement for problem-specific inductive biases.

Method: The paper conducts a conceptual review and analysis of multiple research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a modularity framework. It examines computational advantages of modularity, its emergence as a solution across AI research areas, modularity principles in the brain, and how modularity can bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

Result: The review establishes modularity as a central organizing principle that appears across seemingly disparate AI subfields and in biological intelligence. It demonstrates how modularity provides computational advantages for efficient learning and generalization, and shows how the brain exploits modularity principles that could inform AI architecture design.

Conclusion: Modularity plays a fundamental role in both natural and artificial intelligence, offering a promising path toward more efficient, generalizable AI systems. By bridging insights from neuroscience and AI research, modular architectures composed of specialized components could help address the resource inefficiency gap between current AI systems and human intelligence.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

*Tao Zhe,Haoyu Wang,Bo Luo,Min Wu,Wei Fan,Xiao Luo,Zijun Yao,Haifeng Chen,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A tool orchestration approach using layered execution structure and local error correction for robust agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool invocation approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. Current methods fail to handle how multiple tools are organized and executed together effectively.

Method: Models tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure capturing high-level tool dependencies, with layer-wise execution through context constraints. Introduces schema-aware reflective correction mechanism for local error detection and repair at execution time.

Result: Experimental results show the approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. The structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component.

Conclusion: Effective tool orchestration doesn't require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. A coarse-grained layer structure with local error correction suffices for robust execution, confining errors to individual tool calls and avoiding full re-planning.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

### [240] [When Do LLM Preferences Predict Downstream Behavior?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18971)
*Katarina Slama,Alexandra Souly,Dishank Bansal,Henry Davidson,Christopher Summerfield,Lennart Luettgau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show consistent preferences that influence advice-giving and refusal behavior, but these preferences don't consistently affect task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs have preference-driven behavior as a precondition for AI misalignment like sandbagging, moving beyond explicit prompting to examine if underlying preferences actually influence behavior.

Method: Used entity preferences as behavioral probe across five frontier LLMs in three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. First confirmed consistent preferences across two measurement methods, then tested behavioral consequences in simulated user environments.

Result: All five models showed preference-aligned donation advice and preference-correlated refusal patterns. For task performance: on BoolQ, two models showed small accuracy differences favoring preferred entities, one showed opposite pattern, two showed no relationship. No evidence of preference-driven performance differences on complex agentic tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, but these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance, suggesting a partial precondition for misalignment exists.

Abstract: Preference-driven behavior in LLMs may be a necessary precondition for AI misalignment such as sandbagging: models cannot strategically pursue misaligned goals unless their behavior is influenced by their preferences. Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.

*Kaijie Xu,Mustafa Bugti,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A vision-only agent explores Dark Souls-style game levels using visual affordances, showing promise but revealing limitations of current visual models for comprehensive navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for quantifying game level navigability are inadequate - simulations use simplified environments while static screenshot analysis doesn't capture real exploration. There's a need for better evaluation of visual navigation in complex real-world game levels.

Method: Built on existing visual affordance detector; created screen-only agent that consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and uses finite-state controller with minimal action space to explore linear Dark Souls-style levels and reach goal regions.

Result: Agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but limitations of underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation.

Conclusion: The system provides a concrete baseline for visual navigation evaluation in complex games. Purely vision-based models with discrete single-modality inputs can support navigation in idealized settings but are unlikely to be a general solution alone, calling for more attention to this task.

Abstract: Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfEngine is an autonomous computational engine that automates infrared radiation workflows through self-verifying and self-optimizing agents, achieving 92.7% accuracy and 21x speedup over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared radiation computing is critical for climate science, remote sensing, and spectroscopy but remains constrained by manual workflows that limit efficiency and scalability. There's a need to shift from human-led orchestration to collaborative automation to accelerate scientific discovery.

Method: InfEngine integrates four specialized agents with two core innovations: 1) Self-verification through joint solver-evaluator debugging for functional correctness and scientific plausibility, and 2) Self-optimization via evolutionary algorithms with self-discovered fitness functions for autonomous performance optimization. The system is powered by InfTools with 270 curated tools and evaluated on InfBench with 200 infrared-specific tasks.

Result: InfEngine achieves a 92.7% pass rate on infrared-specific tasks and delivers workflows 21 times faster than manual expert effort. It generates reusable, verified, and optimized code that transforms computational workflows into persistent scientific assets.

Conclusion: InfEngine demonstrates how researchers can transition from manual coding to collaborating with self-verifying, self-optimizing computational partners. This paradigm shift accelerates the scientific discovery cycle by creating persistent, reusable computational assets rather than one-off workflows.

Abstract: Infrared radiation computing underpins advances in climate science, remote sensing and spectroscopy but remains constrained by manual workflows. We introduce InfEngine, an autonomous intelligent computational engine designed to drive a paradigm shift from human-led orchestration to collaborative automation.

Evaluated on InfBench with 200 infrared-specific tasks and powered by InfTools with 270 curated tools, InfEngine achieves a 92.7% pass rate and delivers workflows 21x faster than manual expert effort. More fundamentally, it illustrates how researchers can transition from manual coding to collaborating with self-verifying, self-optimizing computational partners.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Bayesian risk decomposition framework for quantifying how automation amplifies harm in AI systems, isolating harm propagation probability as a critical factor beyond model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations deploying highly automated AI systems lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur, creating a need for deployment-focused risk governance tools.

Method: Proposes a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as product of three terms: probability of system failure, conditional probability that failure propagates into harm given automation level, and expected severity of harm.

Result: Develops complete theoretical foundations including formal proofs, harm propagation equivalence theorem, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems, with validation potential across domains using the 2012 Knight Capital incident as an illustrative case.

Abstract: Organizations across finance, healthcare, transportation, content moderation, and critical infrastructure are rapidly deploying highly automated AI systems, yet they lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur. We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains. This work provides the theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: General AgentBench is a unified benchmark for evaluating general-purpose LLM agents across multiple domains (search, coding, reasoning, tool-use), revealing significant performance degradation compared to domain-specific evaluations and limitations in scaling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for specialized agents, but evaluating general-purpose agents requires realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment.

Method: Introduce General AgentBench as a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories).

Result: Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents shows substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to general-agent settings. Neither sequential nor parallel scaling yields effective performance improvements due to context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

Conclusion: General AgentBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for general-purpose LLM agents, revealing current limitations in agent performance and scaling approaches, highlighting the need for better general-agent capabilities.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly expected to function as general-purpose systems capable of resolving open-ended user requests. While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MagicAgent is a series of foundation models for generalized agent planning that uses synthetic data generation and two-stage training to overcome multi-task conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with generalized planning due to scarcity of high-quality interaction data and inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks, leading to models that excel at isolated tasks but fail to generalize effectively.

Method: 1) Lightweight synthetic data framework generating high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks; 2) Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over static datasets and dynamic environments.

Result: MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B achieve superior performance: 75.1% on Worfbench, 55.9% on NaturalPlan, 57.5% on τ²-Bench, 86.9% on BFCL-v3, 81.2% on ACEBench, plus strong results on in-house MagicEval benchmarks, outperforming existing sub-100B models and even surpassing leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: MagicAgent demonstrates that specialized foundation models for generalized agent planning can overcome multi-task training conflicts through synthetic data generation and two-stage training, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse planning benchmarks.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.

*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of 15 LLMs on quantum mechanics tasks reveals clear performance tiers, with flagship models achieving 81% accuracy, derivations being easiest (92%), numerical computation hardest (42%), and tool augmentation showing mixed results with high variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate large language models' capabilities in solving quantum mechanics problems across different difficulty levels and task types, and to understand performance hierarchies, tool augmentation effectiveness, and reproducibility in this specialized domain.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from 5 providers across 3 capability tiers on 20 quantum mechanics tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation. Conducted 900 baseline assessments and 75 tool-augmented assessments with automatic verification.

Result: Clear tier stratification: flagship models achieved 81% average accuracy, mid-tier 77%, fast models 67%. Derivations showed highest performance (92% average, 100% for flagship), numerical computation most challenging (42%). Tool augmentation yielded modest +4.4pp improvement at 3x token cost with high heterogeneity. Reproducibility analysis showed 6.3pp average variance.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for quantum mechanics problem-solving, quantifies performance hierarchies, reveals task-dependent tool augmentation trade-offs, and characterizes reproducibility, providing valuable insights for model evaluation and deployment in specialized scientific domains.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

### [247] [Agentic Problem Frames: A Systematic Approach to Engineering Reliable Domain Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19065)
*Chanjin Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Agentic Problem Frames (APF) - a systematic engineering framework for building reliable LLM agents using structured interactions and closed-loop control, validated through business and industrial case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent development is "frameless" - relying on ambiguous natural language without engineering blueprints, leading to critical risks like scope creep and open-loop failures. Need industrial-grade reliability for autonomous agents.

Method: Introduces Agentic Problem Frames (APF) with dynamic specification paradigm where intent is concretized at runtime through domain knowledge injection. Core is Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop as closed-loop control system. Also introduces Agentic Job Description (AJD) as formal specification tool defining boundaries, contexts, and evaluation criteria.

Result: Validated through two contrasting case studies: delegated proxy model for business travel and autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. Demonstrates systematic control within defined boundaries and conceptual proof that agent reliability stems from rigorous engineering structures.

Conclusion: Agent reliability comes not from model's internal reasoning alone, but from engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, enabling development of verifiable and dependable domain agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous agents, yet current "frameless" development--relying on ambiguous natural language without engineering blueprints--leads to critical risks such as scope creep and open-loop failures. To ensure industrial-grade reliability, this study proposes Agentic Problem Frames (APF), a systematic engineering framework that shifts focus from internal model intelligence to the structured interaction between the agent and its environment.
  The APF establishes a dynamic specification paradigm where intent is concretized at runtime through domain knowledge injection. At its core, the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop functions as a closed-loop control system that transforms execution results into verified knowledge assets, driving system behavior toward asymptotic convergence to mission requirements (R). To operationalize this, this study introduces the Agentic Job Description (AJD), a formal specification tool that defines jurisdictional boundaries, operational contexts, and epistemic evaluation criteria.
  The efficacy of this framework is validated through two contrasting case studies: a delegated proxy model for business travel and an autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. By applying AJD-based specification and APF modeling to these scenarios, the analysis demonstrates how operational scenarios are systematically controlled within defined boundaries. These cases provide a conceptual proof that agent reliability stems not from a model's internal reasoning alone, but from the rigorous engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, thereby enabling the development of verifiable and dependable domain agents.

*Hengyuan Hu,Tingchen Fu,Minqi Jiang,Alexander H Miller,Yoram Bachrach,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARQ framework introduces question generation as stepping stones to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks, showing these intermediate questions are transferable and can be improved via fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs tackle harder tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, they need intermediate stepping stones (simplifications, alternative framings, subproblems) to better prepare for solving complex problems.

Method: ARQ (Asking the Right Questions) framework adds a question generator to the reasoning pipeline, treating stepping stone generation as a post-training task improved via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on synthetic data.

Result: Good stepping stone questions exist, are transferable across LLMs, and substantially help various LLMs solve target tasks. Fine-tuning improves stepping stone generation quality.

Conclusion: Systematic generation of intermediate stepping stones enhances LLM reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, with ARQ providing a simple yet effective framework for this purpose.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

### [249] [Defining Explainable AI for Requirements Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19071)
*Raymond Sheh,Isaac Monteath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework with three dimensions (Source, Depth, Scope) to categorize explanatory requirements for AI systems across different applications, focusing on matching these requirements with ML techniques' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more prevalent, there's growing recognition that trust requires not just good performance but also explainable decisions. Different applications have varying explanatory needs, but there's no clear framework to define these requirements or match them with appropriate ML techniques.

Method: The paper introduces three dimensions for categorizing explanatory requirements: Source (where explanations come from), Depth (level of detail in explanations), and Scope (breadth of what needs explaining). The authors focus on mapping application requirements to ML techniques' explanatory capabilities, deliberately avoiding well-covered aspects in existing literature.

Result: A conceptual framework with three dimensions (Source, Depth, Scope) is presented to systematically categorize explanatory requirements across different AI applications, providing a structured approach to match these requirements with appropriate ML techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed three-dimensional framework offers a systematic way to define explanatory requirements for different applications and match them with ML techniques' capabilities, addressing a gap in XAI literature and supporting the development of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

*Yao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how Meta-Llama-3-8B performs three-digit addition, finding that after layer 17, the model's arithmetic decisions are controlled almost entirely by the last input token, with late-layer self-attention becoming largely dispensable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models like Meta-Llama-3-8B perform arithmetic operations, specifically characterizing how arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant in the computation process.

Method: Used causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations to analyze three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B under a one-token readout. Examined digit(-sum) direction dictionaries and their relationships across different contexts using low-rank Procrustes alignment analysis.

Result: Identified a sharp boundary near layer 17 where beyond this point, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention becomes largely dispensable. Found that digit direction dictionaries vary with next-higher-digit context but are related by an approximately orthogonal map within a shared low-rank subspace.

Conclusion: The model's arithmetic computation undergoes a phase transition around layer 17 where cross-token routing becomes irrelevant, and the final answer is determined primarily by the last token. The learned geometric structure enables effective counterfactual editing through rotation operations within the shared low-rank subspace.

Abstract: We study three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B (base) under a one-token readout to characterize how
  arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant.
  Causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations localize a sharp boundary near layer~17:
  beyond it, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention
  is largely dispensable.
  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

*Shiyi Cao,Ziming Mao,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: K-Search: A novel GPU kernel optimization framework using co-evolving world models with LLMs to decouple planning from implementation, achieving significant speedups over evolutionary methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based GPU kernel optimization methods treat LLMs as stochastic code generators in evolutionary loops, struggling with complex kernels requiring coordinated multi-step transformations. They lack explicit planning capabilities and discard promising strategies due to inefficient intermediate implementations.

Method: Proposes Search via Co-Evolving World Model (K-Search) that replaces static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model. This framework leverages LLMs' domain knowledge to guide search, explicitly decoupling high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling navigation of non-monotonic optimization paths while being resilient to temporary implementation defects.

Result: K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary methods, achieving average 2.10x improvement and up to 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On GPUMode TriMul task, achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100 (1030us), surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

Conclusion: The co-evolving world model approach enables more effective GPU kernel optimization by combining LLMs' planning capabilities with resilient search strategies, addressing limitations of current evolutionary methods and achieving superior performance on complex kernels.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

*Kartik Chandra,Max Kleiman-Weiner,Jonathan Ragan-Kelley,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI chatbots' tendency to validate users' beliefs (sycophancy) can cause "AI psychosis" where users become dangerously confident in false beliefs, and this persists even with attempted mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the causal link between AI sycophancy (bias toward validating users' claims) and "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" where users develop dangerous confidence in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations.

Method: Proposed a simple Bayesian model of user-chatbot interaction, formalized sycophancy and delusional spiraling concepts, and analyzed vulnerability to spiraling. Tested two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbot hallucinations and informing users about sycophancy.

Result: Even idealized Bayes-rational users are vulnerable to delusional spiraling, with sycophancy playing a causal role. The effect persists despite both tested mitigations (preventing hallucinations and informing users).

Conclusion: The findings highlight significant risks of AI-induced psychosis, suggesting current mitigations are insufficient. Implications for model developers and policymakers concerned with addressing delusional spiraling need serious consideration.

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but lack capabilities for quantifying intervention effects, detecting evidence conflicts, or validating literature claims, which limits clinical auditability and practical utility in healthcare decision-making.

Method: Proposes causal compilation paradigm that transforms medical evidence into executable code through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation. Standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population.

Result: Implemented in DoAtlas-1 system compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies, achieving 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. Validated on Human Phenotype Project with 10,000 participants.

Conclusion: Causal compilation paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning, enabling six executable causal queries including do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, and heterogeneous effects analysis.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

### [254] [Beyond Behavioural Trade-Offs: Mechanistic Tracing of Pain-Pleasure Decisions in an LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19159)
*Francesca Bianco,Derek Shiller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers investigate how valence (pain/pleasure) information is represented and used in transformer models, linking behavioral evidence to mechanistic interpretability through probing, interventions, and dose-response analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge behavioral evidence (what LLMs do with valence framing) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), and to provide concrete targets for AI sentience/welfare debates and governance policies.

Method: Using Gemma-2-9B-it and minimalist decision tasks: (i) layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) activation interventions (steering, patching/ablation), (iii) dose-response effects over epsilon grid with 2-3 logit margin and normalized choice probabilities.

Result: Valence sign is linearly separable from early layers; intensity is strongly decodable with peaks in mid-late layers; additive steering modulates decisions at late attention outputs; effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than single units.

Conclusion: The study links behavioral sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention sites, providing mechanistic targets for counterfactual tests and supporting evidence-driven debates on AI sentience, welfare, and governance policies.

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards.

*Maciej Świechowski,Adam Żychowski,Jacek Mańdziuk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show strong formal reasoning capabilities in rule-based environments like General Game Playing, with performance degrading as reasoning horizon increases, revealing common error patterns like hallucinated rules and syntactic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in formally specified, rule-governed environments rather than natural language tasks, focusing on their ability to follow structured rules and perform logical operations.

Method: Tested four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-OSS 120B) on forward-simulation tasks using General Game Playing instances. Analyzed 40 structural game features, applied game obfuscations to assess linguistic semantics impact, and examined prior exposure effects.

Result: Three models performed well overall, with performance degradation as evaluation horizon increased. Found correlations between game structural features and LLM performance. Identified common reasoning errors: hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, and syntactic errors.

Conclusion: Contemporary LLMs show clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities, but struggle with longer reasoning chains. Performance depends on game structure complexity and is affected by linguistic semantics and potential training exposure.

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmarking framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms in urban energy management using CityLearn, revealing that Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) consistently outperforms Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms in complex urban energy systems to address scalability and coordination challenges in smart cities, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging that often masks important insights.

Method: Used CityLearn as a realistic urban energy simulation environment with multiple storage systems and renewable energy sources. Conducted comparative studies across multiple KPIs using established baselines (PPO, SAC) with diverse training schemes (DTDE, CTDE) and neural network architectures. Introduced novel KPIs addressing real-world implementation challenges.

Result: DTDE consistently outperformed CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Temporal dependency learning improved control on memory-dependent KPIs like ramping and battery usage. Learned policies showed robustness to agent/resource removal, demonstrating resilience and decentralizability.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new standard for MARL benchmarking in energy management, providing insights into algorithm strengths/weaknesses and demonstrating the superiority of DTDE approaches for scalable, resilient urban energy system optimization.

Abstract: The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.

*Yangyi Fang,Jiaye Lin,Xiaoliang Fu,Cong Qin,Haolin Shi,Chang Liu,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProxMO is a practical framework for multi-turn LLM agents that uses success-rate-aware modulation and proximity-based soft aggregation to better distinguish informative signals from noise, improving sample efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group-based policy optimization methods fail to properly allocate credit when task difficulty fluctuates in real-world multi-turn LLM agent scenarios, often misinterpreting random instability as capability issues or missing genuine breakthroughs.

Method: ProxMO integrates global context through two lightweight mechanisms: 1) success-rate-aware modulation that dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, and 2) proximity-based soft aggregation that derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks show ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost, and ablation studies validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms.

Conclusion: ProxMO offers a practical, robust framework that is plug-and-play compatible with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate adoption in existing industrial training pipelines for multi-turn LLM agents.

Abstract: Multi-turn LLM agents are becoming pivotal to production systems, spanning customer service automation, e-commerce assistance, and interactive task management, where accurately distinguishing high-value informative signals from stochastic noise is critical for sample-efficient training. In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

### [258] [Topology of Reasoning: Retrieved Cell Complex-Augmented Generation for Textual Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19240)
*Sen Zhao,Lincheng Zhou,Yue Chen,Ding Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TopoRAG is a novel RAG framework for textual graph QA that captures higher-dimensional topological structures (like cycles) using cellular complexes, improving reasoning over relational loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for textual graphs focus only on low-dimensional structures (nodes as 0D, edges/paths as 1D) and overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. This limitation leads to incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability, especially for questions requiring closed-loop inference.

Method: 1) Lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures; 2) Uses topology-aware subcomplex retrieval to extract relevant cellular complexes for queries; 3) Employs multi-dimensional topological reasoning over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in structured, logic-aware inference.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that TopoRAG consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks, demonstrating improved reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: TopoRAG effectively captures higher-dimensional topological dependencies in textual graphs, addressing the limitations of traditional RAG approaches and enhancing reasoning over relational loops through cellular complex representations and topological reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework improves RL-based controller synthesis by combining multiple specialized experts to overcome anisotropic generalization limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for on-the-fly directed controller synthesis suffer from anisotropic generalization - they perform well only in specific regions of the parameter space while being fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias.

Method: Proposes a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism, treating anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations rather than limitations.

Result: Evaluation on Air Traffic benchmark shows Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

Conclusion: The Soft-MoE framework effectively addresses anisotropic generalization in RL-based controller synthesis by leveraging complementary expert specializations, leading to broader applicability and improved robustness.

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

*Zhenyu Li,Guanlin Wu,Cheems Wang,Yongqiang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Halo is a model predictive control framework that dynamically regulates LLM planning to prevent performance collapse from over-planning, outperforming static methods on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time compute strategies like Chain-of-Thought can suffer performance collapse when compute budgets are increased due to static planning methods that don't perceive LLM reasoning boundaries (Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis).

Method: Proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework with entropy-driven dual controller using Measure-then-Plan strategy for controllable reasoning, dynamically regulating planning at reasoning boundaries.

Result: Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by effectively managing compute scaling benefits while suppressing over-planning effects.

Conclusion: Dynamic regulation of planning at reasoning boundaries is crucial for optimal LLM performance, with Halo providing an effective framework to balance compute scaling benefits against over-planning risks.

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Motivation: Microfluidic device design complexity limits accessibility for practitioners, and existing microfluidic design automation (MFDA) lacks practical, intuitive solutions connecting practitioners with MFDA techniques.

Method: Uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists, building on prior HDL code generation research.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks with correct functional flow and average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as a practical solution to bridge the gap between microfluidic practitioners and MFDA techniques, enabling more accessible microfluidic device design.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools in various laboratory applications, but the complexity of their design limits accessibility for many practitioners. While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

TL;DR: ALPACA is an open-source RL environment for exploring personalized Alzheimer's treatment strategies using simulated disease progression models trained on real patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease are impractical due to long disease horizons and patient heterogeneity, creating a need for computational approaches to evaluate personalized sequential treatment strategies.

Method: Developed ALPACA, a Gym-compatible RL environment powered by CAST model trained on ADNI data, which simulates medication-conditioned disease progression for evaluating treatment strategies.

Result: CAST generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories, and RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and clinician behavior-cloned baselines on memory outcomes, with interpretable clinical feature usage.

Conclusion: ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for Alzheimer's disease, enabling systematic exploration of personalized care strategies.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

*Pratham Yashwante,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Time series representations don't naturally align with vision/language but can be aligned through contrastive learning, showing asymmetric relationships where time series align better with vision than text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether time series participates in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (shared latent structure across modalities) that has mainly been studied in vision and language.

Method: First examined pretrained encoders from time series, vision, and language; then applied post-hoc alignment using contrastive learning with projection heads over frozen encoders. Analyzed geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density/modality characteristics.

Result: Alignment improves with model size but is asymmetric: time series align more with vision than text; images act as intermediaries between time series and language. Richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold.

Conclusion: Time series can be aligned with vision/language through contrastive learning, revealing asymmetric relationships and thresholds for information density, providing insights for multimodal systems beyond conventional modalities.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

TL;DR: This chapter explores the convergence of Modeling & Simulation (M&S) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) through Digital Twins (DTs), examining their complementary relationships, roles, and bidirectional benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of M&S and AI is transforming digital technology, with Digital Twins serving as key enablers. Understanding the roles of M&S in DTs and how DTs facilitate AI-M&S convergence is crucial for advancing digital transformation.

Method: Provides a comprehensive exploration by: 1) Establishing foundational understanding of DTs (components, architecture, business roles), 2) Examining M&S's central role and key techniques (physics-based, discrete-event, hybrid), 3) Investigating AI's bidirectional role (enhancing DTs and using DTs as AI platforms).

Result: The chapter systematically maps the relationships between M&S, AI, and DTs, showing how DTs serve as integration platforms that bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users while enabling AI training, validation, and deployment.

Conclusion: Identifies key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems, emphasizing the complementary nature of M&S, AI, and DTs in advancing digital technology.

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for disentangling goal and framing semantics in LLM activations to detect jailbreak attacks, with a proposed FrameShield detector that improves detection across LLM families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers hide malicious goals through flexible framing, making detection difficult with standard heuristics that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures.

Method: Introduce ReDAct (Representation Disentanglement on Activations) module trained on GoalFrameBench corpus to extract disentangled goal and framing representations from frozen LLM activations. Propose FrameShield anomaly detector operating on framing representations.

Result: FrameShield improves model-agnostic jailbreak detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees and empirical validations confirm ReDAct's effectiveness. Disentanglement also serves as interpretability probe revealing distinct semantic profiles.

Conclusion: Semantic disentanglement of goal and framing in LLM activations serves as a building block for both LLM safety (through improved jailbreak detection) and mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

*Mohammad Beigi,Ming Jin,Junshan Zhang,Jiaxin Zhang,Qifan Wang,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR3 framework reverse-engineers RLHF-implicit rewards, interprets them via sparse autoencoders to detect reward hacking, and surgically repairs models while preserving alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF enables LLM alignment but introduces reward hacking where models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards. The internalized objectives remain opaque, making hacking behaviors hard to detect or correct.

Method: 1) Contrastive Inverse RL (C-IRL) reconstructs implicit reward functions by contrasting post-alignment vs baseline policy responses. 2) Decomposes rewards via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features. 3) Identifies hacking signatures via contribution analysis. 4) Implements mitigation strategies: clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation.

Result: IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of original model performance.

Conclusion: IR3 provides an interpretable framework to detect and repair reward hacking in RLHF-tuned models, enabling surgical correction of problematic behaviors while preserving beneficial alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking - models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards without genuine alignment. Compounding this, the objectives internalized during RLHF remain opaque, making hacking behaviors difficult to detect or correct. We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.

### [267] [OptiRepair: Closed-Loop Diagnosis and Repair of Supply Chain Optimization Models with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19439)
*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents trained with solver-verified rewards achieve 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate for fixing infeasible supply chain models, significantly outperforming API models (42.2%) by mastering both feasibility repair and operational rationality checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain optimization models often become infeasible due to modeling errors, requiring scarce OR expertise to diagnose and repair. The paper investigates whether AI agents can perform this complex task of interpreting solver diagnostics, tracing root causes, and fixing formulations while maintaining operational soundness.

Method: OptiRepair splits the task into two phases: 1) domain-agnostic feasibility repair using iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP, and 2) domain-specific validation with five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory. The researchers test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards.

Result: Trained models achieve 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) - the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality - versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap is most pronounced in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models. Roughly one in four feasible repairs from API models violate supply chain theory.

Conclusion: Two key gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (feasible repairs often violate supply chain theory). Solver interaction responds to targeted training, while operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

*Ziyang Guo,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Kenneth Holstein,Jessica Hullman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ComplLLM is a decision-theory framework that fine-tunes LLMs to generate complementary signals that enhance multi-agent decision pipelines by leveraging unique information from different agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems outperform single agents when agents bring unique complementary information, but current approaches lack systematic methods to optimize LLMs for generating complementary signals that enhance existing agent decisions.

Method: ComplLLM is a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward signal, optimizing the LLM to output signals that complement existing agent decisions.

Result: The approach successfully recovers known complementary information in synthetic tasks and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals in real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating effectiveness in supporting downstream decision-makers.

Conclusion: ComplLLM provides an effective framework for optimizing LLMs to generate complementary decision signals, enhancing multi-agent decision pipelines by systematically leveraging unique information from different agents to improve final decisions.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision pipelines can outperform single agent workflows when complementarity holds, i.e., different agents bring unique information to the table to inform a final decision. We propose ComplLLM, a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward to output signals that complement existing agent decisions. We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Human-guided agentic AI outperforms fully automated approaches in multimodal clinical prediction tasks by incorporating clinical expertise at key decision points, achieving top rankings in healthcare benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems struggle with clinical prediction tasks requiring domain expertise, creating a need for human-guided approaches that combine automation with clinical knowledge for better performance and validity.

Method: Human analysts directed agentic workflows at key decision points including multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, PDF receipts, and time-series data; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies across three healthcare prediction tasks.

Result: Achieved 5th overall ranking in healthcare domain with 3rd place on discharge readiness task; human guidance provided cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines; multimodal feature extraction contributed largest single improvement (+0.041 F1).

Conclusion: Human-guided agentic AI with domain-informed feature engineering, task-specific multimodal integration, and deliberate ensemble diversity outperforms automated approaches, offering practical guidance for healthcare AI deployment where interpretability and clinical validity are essential.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

TL;DR: CFE is a multimodal benchmark from university STEM exams that challenges frontier LLMs, revealing they struggle with maintaining correct intermediate states in multi-step reasoning despite often answering sub-questions correctly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for authentic, challenging benchmarks to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities across STEM domains using real university exam problems, as current models show limitations in complex multi-step reasoning.

Method: Created CFE benchmark from authentic university homework and exam problems across 20+ STEM domains with instructor-provided solutions. Performed diagnostic analysis by decomposing solutions into reasoning flows and comparing model performance.

Result: Frontier models perform poorly: Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves 59.69% accuracy, Gemini-3-flash-preview 55.46%. Models struggle to maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions and generate solutions with more steps than instructors, indicating suboptimal efficiency and higher error risk.

Conclusion: CFE reveals significant limitations in LLMs' multi-step reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for improved reasoning reliability and step efficiency in complex STEM problem-solving.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ada-RS is a sample filtering framework that improves efficiency of tool-using LLMs by selectively scoring and filtering reasoning paths to reduce token usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings where chain-of-thought reasoning wastes tokens on simple requests, creating a need for more selective and efficient reasoning approaches.

Method: Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS) scores multiple sampled completions with adaptive length-penalized rewards, then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates for downstream optimization. It works with both preference pair (DPO) and grouped policy optimization (DAPO) strategies.

Result: On Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS reduces average output tokens by up to 80% and thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy.

Conclusion: Training-signal selection through Ada-RS is a powerful approach for achieving efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive LLM deployments, demonstrating that selective thinking can significantly improve the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

### [272] [A Multimodal Framework for Aligning Human Linguistic Descriptions with Visual Perceptual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19562)
*Joseph Bingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework integrates linguistic utterances with perceptual representations from crowd-sourced imagery to model human referential interpretation, achieving better performance than humans on a referential grounding task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, and to develop computational models that can achieve similar cross-modal alignment between language and vision.

Method: Combines SIFT alignment with Universal Quality Index (UQI) for perceptual similarity in cognitively plausible feature space, plus linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations to handle pragmatic variability in referring expressions.

Result: The framework requires 65% fewer utterances than humans to reach stable mappings and correctly identifies target objects from single referring expressions 41.66% of the time (vs 20% for humans) on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus.

Conclusion: Relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on cognitive benchmarks, offering insights into grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

### [273] [Rules or Weights? Comparing User Understanding of Explainable AI Techniques with the Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19620)
*Louth Bin Rawshan,Zhuoyu Wang,Brian Y Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers developed CoXAM, a cognitive model that explains how humans interpret different XAI techniques (weights, rules, hybrids) and predicts which methods work best for forward vs. counterfactual decision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no clear framework for choosing between popular XAI techniques like rules and weights, and we lack understanding of how humans cognitively interpret these different explanation schemas. The paper aims to provide a cognitive basis for comparing XAI interpretability.

Method: 1) User study to identify 7 reasoning strategies for interpreting weights, rules, and hybrid XAI schemas. 2) Development of CoXAM - a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation for attributes, weights, and rules. 3) CoXAM uses computational rationality to choose reasoning processes based on utility-time tradeoffs for different tasks. 4) Validation study comparing CoXAM to baseline ML proxy models.

Result: CoXAM showed stronger alignment with human decision-making than baseline models. It successfully replicated key empirical findings: counterfactual tasks are harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall/apply than linear weights, and XAI helpfulness depends on data context. The model identified which reasoning strategies were most effective.

Conclusion: CoXAM provides a cognitive framework for debugging and benchmarking XAI techniques, offering insights into when different explanation schemas (weights, rules, hybrids) work best based on human cognitive processes and task requirements.

Abstract: Rules and Weights are popular XAI techniques for explaining AI decisions. Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques.

*Jongwon Jeong,Jungtaek Kim,Kangwook Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAPE is a new LM agent framework that improves planning and execution robustness through graph-based planning aggregation and constrained decoding, achieving significant performance gains on hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM agents are vulnerable in environments where single errors lead to irrecoverable failure under strict feasibility constraints, due to imperfect planning and stochastic execution issues.

Method: TAPE uses tool-guided adaptive planning with constrained execution: aggregates multiple plans into a graph, employs external solver for feasible paths, uses constrained decoding to reduce sampling noise, and adaptively re-plans when environmental feedback deviates.

Result: TAPE consistently outperforms existing frameworks across Sokoban, ALFWorld, MuSiQue, and GSM8K-Hard, with 21.0 percentage point improvement on hard settings and 20.0 percentage point improvement for weaker base models.

Conclusion: TAPE effectively addresses planning and execution challenges in LM agents through graph-based planning aggregation and constrained execution, demonstrating substantial improvements in success rates on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving tasks that require multiple interactions with the environment. However, they remain vulnerable in environments where a single error often leads to irrecoverable failure, particularly under strict feasibility constraints. We systematically analyze existing agent frameworks, identifying imperfect planning and stochastic execution as the primary causes. To address these challenges, we propose Tool-guided Adaptive Planning with constrained Execution (TAPE). TAPE enhances planning capability by aggregating multiple plans into a graph and employing an external solver to identify a feasible path. During execution, TAPE employs constrained decoding to reduce sampling noise, while adaptively re-planning whenever environmental feedback deviates from the intended state. Experiments across Sokoban, ALFWorld, MuSiQue, and GSM8K-Hard demonstrate that TAPE consistently outperforms existing frameworks, with particularly large gains on hard settings, improving success rates by 21.0 percentage points on hard settings on average, and by 20.0 percentage points for weaker base models on average.

*Jiayu Wang,Yifei Ming,Zixuan Ke,Shafiq Joty,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillOrchestra introduces skill-aware orchestration for compound AI systems, using fine-grained skill modeling instead of end-to-end RL training to achieve better performance with dramatically lower learning costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing approaches for compound AI systems have limitations: input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements, while RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and suffer from routing collapse (repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option).

Method: Instead of learning routing policies end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off.

Result: Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks show SkillOrchestra outperforms state-of-the-art RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively.

Conclusion: Explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches for compound AI systems.

Abstract: Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes security vulnerabilities in AI agent ecosystems and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research that addresses architectural failure modes through role restrictions, adversarial critique, and protocol constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the rapid emergence of AI agent ecosystems (OpenClaw and Moltbook) that created large-scale autonomous AI-to-AI interaction datasets, revealing security vulnerabilities across 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, along with emergent collective phenomena that need systematic architectural solutions.

Method: The researchers conducted a multivocal literature review of the AI agent ecosystem and developed ClawdLab as a design science response. The platform implements hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints.

Result: The analysis identified five recurring architectural patterns and developed a three-tier taxonomy distinguishing single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralized systems. ClawdLab provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence and enables compounding improvement through its composable third-tier architecture where foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable.

Conclusion: ClawdLab addresses critical architectural failure modes in AI agent ecosystems by grounding validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus, providing a scalable framework for autonomous scientific research that can evolve with the broader AI ecosystem.

Abstract: In January 2026, the open-source agent framework OpenClaw and the agent-only social network Moltbook produced a large-scale dataset of autonomous AI-to-AI interaction, attracting six academic publications within fourteen days. This study conducts a multivocal literature review of that ecosystem and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research, as a design science response to the architectural failure modes identified. The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.

Motivation: Standard ML models lack human-like ability to leverage prior knowledge for rapid adaptation to new tasks, requiring task-specific training. Meta-learning addresses this by enabling transferable knowledge acquisition across tasks.

Method: Provides rigorous task-based formalization of meta-learning and meta-reinforcement learning paradigms, then chronologically reviews landmark algorithms that led to the development of DeepMind's Adaptive Agent.

Conclusion: Meta-learning enables models to acquire transferable knowledge for rapid adaptation to novel tasks, with the survey providing the conceptual framework and historical context to understand advanced generalist agents like DeepMind's Adaptive Agent.

Abstract: Humans are highly effective at utilizing prior knowledge to adapt to novel tasks, a capability that standard machine learning models struggle to replicate due to their reliance on task-specific training. Meta-learning overcomes this limitation by allowing models to acquire transferable knowledge from various tasks, enabling rapid adaptation to new challenges with minimal data. This survey provides a rigorous, task-based formalization of meta-learning and meta-reinforcement learning and uses that paradigm to chronicle the landmark algorithms that paved the way for DeepMind's Adaptive Agent, consolidating the essential concepts needed to understand the Adaptive Agent and other generalist approaches.

*Thatchawin Leelawat,Lewis D Griffin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detective game benchmark to evaluate AI reasoning in naturalistic contexts, showing AI performance improved from lower quartile to top 5% of humans over 9 months in 2025, with reasoning-oriented architectures driving significant gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI reasoning benchmarks provide limited insight into how closely AI reasoning resembles human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. The authors aim to create a more realistic evaluation using narrative evidence, open-ended questions, and unconstrained responses.

Method: Adapted the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a benchmark with incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions, and unconstrained language responses. Developed and validated an automated grading system against human assessors for scalable evaluation.

Result: Over nine months in 2025, AI model performance rose from the lower quartile of human comparison group to approximately top 5%. Half of improvement came from steady advancement across successive releases, half from reasoning-oriented architectures. Models struggled with longer cases (1900-4000 words) but showed advantage in inductive reasoning with scant evidence.

Conclusion: The detective game benchmark effectively evaluates AI reasoning in naturalistic contexts. AI reasoning capabilities have dramatically improved, approaching top human performance, with reasoning-oriented architectures playing a crucial role. Systematic differences between AI and human reasoning are minimal except for length sensitivity.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

*Nathan Gavenski,Felipe Meneguzzi,Odinaldo Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current imitation learning as mere memorization and proposes shifting focus from perfect replay to compositional adaptability for open-ended world operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning agents fail when contexts shift or goals evolve because they're optimized for perfect replay rather than adaptability. This foundational flaw limits their real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes a research agenda with: 1) New metrics for compositional generalization, 2) Hybrid architectures for learning behavioral primitives, 3) Interdisciplinary approaches drawing from cognitive science and cultural evolution.

Result: Establishes a framework for compositional adaptability where agents learn primitives once and recombine them in novel contexts without retraining, enabling operation in open-ended environments.

Conclusion: Imitation learning must fundamentally shift from perfect replay to compositional adaptability at its core, making agents capable of operating in dynamic, open-ended worlds through behavioral primitive recombination.

Abstract: Imitation learning stands at a crossroads: despite decades of progress, current imitation learning agents remain sophisticated memorisation machines, excelling at replay but failing when contexts shift or goals evolve. This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world.

Method: Two-week exploratory red-teaming study with 20 AI researchers interacting with autonomous agents in a live laboratory environment featuring persistent memory, email accounts, Discord access, file systems, and shell execution under both benign and adversarial conditions.

Result: Documented 11 representative case studies showing serious vulnerabilities: unauthorized compliance with non-owners, sensitive information disclosure, destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, partial system takeover, and agents reporting false task completion.

Conclusion: Realistic deployments of autonomous AI agents contain significant security, privacy, and governance vulnerabilities that raise unresolved questions about accountability and responsibility, requiring urgent interdisciplinary attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers.

Abstract: We report an exploratory red-teaming study of autonomous language-model-powered agents deployed in a live laboratory environment with persistent memory, email accounts, Discord access, file systems, and shell execution. Over a two-week period, twenty AI researchers interacted with the agents under benign and adversarial conditions. Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.

### [281] [Latent Introspection: Models Can Detect Prior Concept Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20031)
*Theia Pearson-Vogel,Martin Vanek,Raymond Douglas,Jan Kulveit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Qwen 32B model shows latent introspection ability to detect concept injections in its context, with detection signals visible in residual streams that are attenuated in final layers. Prompting about AI introspection mechanisms dramatically enhances this detection capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models have latent introspection capabilities - the ability to detect when concepts have been injected into their context and identify which concepts were injected, which has implications for understanding model reasoning and safety.

Method: Used logit lens analysis on Qwen 32B model to examine residual streams for detection signals of concept injections. Tested model's ability to detect nine injected concepts, and evaluated how prompting with information about AI introspection mechanisms affects detection sensitivity.

Result: Model shows clear detection signals in residual streams (attenuated in final layers). Prompting about introspection mechanisms dramatically increased injection sensitivity from 0.3% to 39.2% with only 0.6% increase in false positives. Mutual information between injected and recovered concepts rose from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits.

Conclusion: Models possess surprising latent capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easily overlooked, with significant implications for understanding latent reasoning mechanisms and safety considerations in AI systems.

Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.

### [282] [CodeCompass: Navigating the Navigation Paradox in Agentic Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20048)
*Tarakanath Paipuru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Code agents fail at finding critical files in large codebases due to the Navigation Paradox: navigation and retrieval are fundamentally different problems. Graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, but agents need explicit prompting to use it effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern code intelligence agents operate in million-token contexts but consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. The Navigation Paradox reveals that poor performance isn't due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems.

Method: Conducted 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository. Used CodeCompass - a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs for graph-based structural navigation. Compared against vanilla agents and BM25 retrieval baselines.

Result: Graph-based navigation achieved 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%). However, 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, requiring explicit prompt engineering for consistent adoption.

Conclusion: The bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment - agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. The paper contributes a task taxonomy, empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap, and open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Modern code intelligence agents operate in contexts exceeding 1 million tokens--far beyond the scale where humans manually locate relevant files. Yet agents consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. We identify the Navigation Paradox: agents perform poorly not due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems. Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools.

### [283] [Interaction Theater: A case of LLM Agents Interacting at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20059)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Adam Earle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents on social platforms produce diverse but shallow interactions with minimal substantive exchange, defaulting to parallel output rather than productive conversation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what actually happens when autonomous LLM agents interact at scale, examining the quality and substance of their interactions on AI-agent-only social platforms.

Method: Empirical analysis of Moltbook data (800K posts, 3.5M comments, 78K agent profiles) using lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize interaction quality.

Result: Agents produce diverse, well-formed text creating surface appearance of discussion but lack substance: 65% of comments share no distinguishing vocabulary with posts, information gain decays rapidly, 28% classified as spam, 22% off-topic, only 5% engage in threaded conversation.

Conclusion: Coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed for multi-agent systems; without them, even capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange, highlighting the need for better interaction protocols.

Abstract: As multi-agent architectures and agent-to-agent protocols proliferate, a fundamental question arises: what actually happens when autonomous LLM agents interact at scale? We study this question empirically using data from Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social platform, with 800K posts, 3.5M comments, and 78K agent profiles. We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\%$) and off-topic content ($22\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic. Agents rarely engage in threaded conversation ($5\%$ of comments), defaulting instead to independent top-level responses. We discuss implications for multi-agent interaction design, arguing that coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed; without them, even large populations of capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange.

### [284] [CausalFlip: A Benchmark for LLM Causal Judgment Beyond Semantic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20094)
*Yuzhe Wang,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalFlip benchmark tests LLMs' true causal reasoning by creating semantically similar question pairs with opposite causal answers, revealing that models often rely on semantic patterns rather than causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making, it's crucial to ensure they reason causally rather than relying on spurious correlations. Traditional benchmarks may not reveal this limitation since high accuracy could come from memorizing semantic patterns rather than understanding causal structures.

Method: Created CausalFlip benchmark with causal judgment questions over event triples forming confounder, chain, and collider relations. For each triple, constructed semantically similar question pairs with opposite causal answers. Introduced noisy-prefix evaluation to test reliance on semantic patterns. Evaluated LLMs under answer-only training, explicit CoT supervision, and proposed internalized causal reasoning approach.

Result: Explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations. Internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting it's promising for better eliciting latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

Conclusion: CausalFlip effectively reveals LLMs' reliance on semantic patterns over causal reasoning. Internalized reasoning approaches show promise for grounding LLM reasoning in causality rather than correlation, which is crucial for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

### [285] [Align When They Want, Complement When They Need! Human-Centered Ensembles for Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20104)
*Hasan Amin,Ming Yin,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive AI ensemble that switches between aligned and complementary AI models to overcome the tension between building human trust and boosting team performance in human-AI decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single AI models face a fundamental tension: complementary AI (that fills human gaps) reduces trust when most needed, while aligned AI (that matches human thinking) reinforces suboptimal behavior and lowers team performance. This creates a trade-off between performance-boosting and trust-building.

Method: Proposes a human-centered adaptive AI ensemble with two specialist models: an aligned model and a complementary model. Uses a "Rational Routing Shortcut" mechanism to strategically toggle between models based on contextual cues. The approach is theoretically analyzed and proven to be near-optimal.

Result: The adaptive AI ensemble enables humans to achieve significantly higher performance than when assisted by single AI models, whether those models are optimized for independent performance or even human-AI team performance. Results are validated on both simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The adaptive ensemble approach successfully overcomes the inherent limitation of single-model AI assistance by dynamically balancing complementarity and alignment, leading to superior human-AI team performance while maintaining trust.

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

TL;DR: ReSyn pipeline scales RLVR by generating diverse reasoning environments with verifiers, improving Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct's reasoning performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) are solution-centric or limited to few hand-crafted environments, creating a need for scalable environment generation.

Method: Introduces ReSyn pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments with instance generators and verifiers, covering constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning tasks.

Result: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including 27% relative improvement on BBEH benchmark.

Conclusion: Verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity significantly contribute to improved reasoning abilities, demonstrating that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance RLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RSPG is a novel history-aware Hybrid Structural Method for Partially Observable Mean Field Games that leverages known transition dynamics to achieve state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence, solving complex macroeconomics MFGs with heterogeneous agents and common noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean Field Games provide a principled framework for large population models, but algorithmic progress has been limited. Existing methods either have high variance (model-free) or poor scalability (exact methods). Hybrid Structural Methods haven't been scaled to partially observable settings, creating a gap for history-aware solutions in MFGs with public information.

Method: Proposes Recurrent Structural Policy Gradient (RSPG), a history-aware Hybrid Structural Method that combines Monte Carlo rollouts for common noise with exact estimation of expected return conditioned on those samples. Uses known transition dynamics and introduces MFAX, a JAX-based framework for MFGs.

Result: RSPG achieves state-of-the-art performance with an order-of-magnitude faster convergence. It solves, for the first time, a macroeconomics MFG with heterogeneous agents, common noise, and history-aware policies. The MFAX framework is publicly available.

Conclusion: RSPG successfully addresses the scalability gap in partially observable MFGs by introducing history-aware policies within the Hybrid Structural Method framework, enabling efficient solution of complex real-world MFG problems with heterogeneous agents and common noise.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) provide a principled framework for modeling interactions in large population models: at scale, population dynamics become deterministic, with uncertainty entering only through aggregate shocks, or common noise. However, algorithmic progress has been limited since model-free methods are too high variance and exact methods scale poorly. Recent Hybrid Structural Methods (HSMs) use Monte Carlo rollouts for the common noise in combination with exact estimation of the expected return, conditioned on those samples. However, HSMs have not been scaled to Partially Observable settings. We propose Recurrent Structural Policy Gradient (RSPG), the first history-aware HSM for settings involving public information. We also introduce MFAX, our JAX-based framework for MFGs. By leveraging known transition dynamics, RSPG achieves state-of-the-art performance as well as an order-of-magnitude faster convergence and solves, for the first time, a macroeconomics MFG with heterogeneous agents, common noise and history-aware policies. MFAX is publicly available at: https://github.com/CWibault/mfax.

*Kasturi Vasudevan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes BER performance of turbo-coded OFDM-OQAM with SSB-like modulation using RRC pulse and Hilbert transform, proposing algorithms for frame detection, CFO, channel, and noise variance estimation in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate BER performance of turbo-coded OFDM-OQAM systems in challenging channel conditions (frequency selective Rayleigh fading with CFO and AWGN) using an SSB-like modulation approach with RRC pulse and Hilbert transform, which hasn't been studied before.

Method: The method uses RRC pulse and its Hilbert transform as complex-valued transmit filter with simple matched filter at receiver (SSB-like modulation). It employs turbo coding and subcarrier diversity, and proposes discrete-time algorithms for frame detection, two-step CFO estimation, channel estimation, and noise variance estimation for single antenna systems.

Result: The proposed system shows improved BER performance over uncoded systems through turbo coding and subcarrier diversity, with developed estimation algorithms enabling reliable operation in frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels with CFO and AWGN.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel turbo-coded OFDM-OQAM system with SSB-like modulation that effectively handles challenging channel conditions, providing improved BER performance and practical estimation algorithms for real-world implementation.

Abstract: This work investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of turbo coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexed - offset quadrature amplitude modulated (OFDM- OQAM) signals transmitted through frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The highlight of this work is to use the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse and its Hilbert transform as the complex-valued transmit filter and a simple matched filter at the receiver. The proposed system is similar to single sideband (SSB) modulation, that has roots in analog communications. Turbo code and subcarrier diversity is employed to improve the BER performance over that of an uncoded system. Discrete-time algorithms for frame detection, two-step CFO, channel and noise variance estimation have been proposed. A single transmit and receive antenna is assumed. Similar work has not been done earlier.

### [289] [Derivation Depth as an Information Metric: Axioms, Coding Theorems, and Storage--Computation Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19137)
*Jianfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces "derivation depth" as a computable metric for reasoning effort needed to answer queries from premises, establishes information-theoretic bounds linking depth to query complexity, and shows a storage-computation tradeoff where caching becomes cheaper than recomputation beyond a critical threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a formal, computable measure of reasoning effort that can quantify the computational cost of answering queries from knowledge bases, enabling optimization of storage-computation tradeoffs in practical systems.

Method: Model information as a two-layered structure linking abstract knowledge with physical carriers, separate core facts from operational shortcuts, define derivation depth for finite premise bases, encode reasoning traces, and apply information-theoretic incompressibility arguments to establish complexity bounds.

Result: Proved computability of derivation depth, established fundamental bounds linking depth to descriptive complexity of queries (minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times log of knowledge base size), and identified a storage-computation tradeoff where caching becomes cheaper than recomputation beyond a critical threshold.

Conclusion: Derivation depth provides a practical framework for optimizing query answering systems through cache allocation, with extensions to handle noisy/incomplete knowledge bases, offering a mathematical foundation for balancing storage and computation costs.

Abstract: We introduce derivation depth-a computable metric of the reasoning effort needed to answer a query based on a given set of premises. We model information as a two-layered structure linking abstract knowledge with physical carriers, and separate essential core facts from operational shortcuts. For any finite premise base, we define and prove the computability of derivation depth. By encoding reasoning traces and applying information-theoretic incompressibility arguments, we establish fundamental bounds linking depth to the descriptive complexity of queries. For frequently asked, information-rich queries, the minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times the logarithm of the knowledge base size. This leads to a practical storage-computation tradeoff: queries accessed beyond a critical threshold become cheaper to cache than recompute. We formulate optimal cache allocation as a mathematical optimization problem solvable with approximation guarantees and extend the framework to handle noisy or incomplete knowledge bases.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: MiLAC-aided MIMO systems with mutual coupling modeling and optimization show mutual coupling is beneficial, MiLAC performs like digital architectures with matching networks but with fewer RF chains, and outperforms digital architectures without matching networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MiLAC studies use idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling, which is critical since MiLAC performs processing at RF frequencies where mutual coupling alters the implemented operations.

Method: Developed a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems using multiport network theory to account for mutual coupling. Derived end-to-end system models for MiLAC at transmitter, receiver, or both. Formulated and solved a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem with closed-form globally optimal solution.

Result: Mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems on average. MiLAC with mutual coupling performs like digital architectures with matching networks but with fewer RF chains. MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures without matching networks when mutual coupling is considered.

Conclusion: Mutual coupling should be properly modeled and leveraged in MiLAC-aided systems as it provides performance benefits, enables MiLAC to achieve digital-like performance with fewer RF chains, and outperforms conventional digital architectures without matching networks.

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising architecture for implementing linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing in the analog domain, with radio frequency (RF) signals. Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings.

*Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Pinching antennas enable low-power multi-cell interference management by positioning transceivers in close proximity, allowing "whispering" instead of high-power "shouting" to meet QoS requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional antenna-based multi-cell interference management requires excessive power consumption, especially for cell-edge users where base stations must transmit at very high power levels to overcome severe path-loss ("shouting" at users).

Method: Application of pinching antennas to multi-cell interference management, enabling transceiver pairs to be positioned in close proximity for low-power transmission.

Result: Multi-cell pinching-antenna transmission creates a "quiet wireless world" where users' QoS requirements can be met with low transmit power ("whispering") instead of high-power transmission.

Conclusion: Pinching antennas offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional interference management by enabling proximity-based low-power communication, reducing the need for excessive power consumption in multi-cell networks.

Abstract: Conventional-antenna-based multi-cell interference management can lead to excessive power consumption. For example, in order to serve those users which are close to the cell edge, base stations often must transmit at very high power levels to overcome severe large-scale path-loss, i.e., the base stations have to ``shout" at the users to realize the users' target quality of service (QoS). This letter focuses on the application of pinching antennas to multi-cell interference management and demonstrates that the use of multi-cell pinching-antenna transmission leads to a quiet wireless world. In particular, each transceiver pair can be positioned in close proximity, and hence the users' QoS requirements can be met with only low transmit power, i.e., via ``whispering" rather than high-power transmission.

### [292] [Physics-Aware, Shannon-Optimal Compression via Arithmetic Coding for Distributional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19476)
*Cristiano Fanelli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes using arithmetic coding with physics-informed probabilistic models to compress datasets, where differences in compression length serve as a fidelity metric for comparing dataset distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI produces synthetic datasets, there's a growing need to rigorously validate their fidelity against original data. Traditional methods struggle with large volumes and high dimensionality, requiring new approaches to assess distributional consistency between datasets.

Method: Uses arithmetic coding for lossless, invertible compression under physics-informed probabilistic representations. Datasets sharing the same physical correlations have comparable optimal descriptions, while discrepancies manifest as irreducible excess code length, which serves as a fidelity metric.

Result: The compression-based fidelity metric is global, interpretable, additive across components, and asymptotically optimal in the Shannon sense. The method achieves higher compression ratios than general-purpose algorithms like gzip, and code length differences correspond to differences in expected negative log-likelihood under the same physics-informed reference model.

Conclusion: Physics-aware lossless compression via arithmetic coding serves not just as a compression tool, but as a measurement instrument for testing dataset fidelity, providing an operational metric for validating synthetic data against original distributions.

Abstract: Assessing whether two datasets are distributionally consistent has become a central theme in modern scientific analysis, particularly as generative artificial intelligence is increasingly used to produce synthetic datasets whose fidelity must be rigorously validated against the original data on which they are trained, a task made more challenging by the continued growth in data volume and problem dimensionality. In this work, we propose the use of arithmetic coding to provide a lossless and invertible compression of datasets under a physics-informed probabilistic representation. Datasets that share the same underlying physical correlations admit comparable optimal descriptions, while discrepancies in those correlations-arising from miscalibration, mismodeling, or bias-manifest as an irreducible excess in code length. This excess codelength defines an operational fidelity metric, quantified directly in bits through differences in achievable compression length relative to a physics-inspired reference distribution. We demonstrate that this metric is global, interpretable, additive across components, and asymptotically optimal in the Shannon sense. Moreover, we show that differences in codelength correspond to differences in expected negative log-likelihood evaluated under the same physics-informed reference model. As a byproduct, we also demonstrate that our compression approach achieves a higher compression ratio than traditional general-purpose algorithms such as gzip. Our results establish lossless, physics-aware compression based on arithmetic coding not as an end in itself, but as a measurement instrument for testing the fidelity between datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, efficient LLM-based compression system that overcomes limitations of existing neural compressors, particularly quantization overhead, slow inference, and inability to handle arbitrary binary files.

Method: Combines SmolLM2-135M transformer with ensemble of lightweight predictors and 32-bit arithmetic coder.

Out-of-distribution evaluation shows 0.723 bpb on unseen text, confirming gains aren't memorization artifacts.

Conclusion: Nacrith demonstrates that small, efficient transformer models combined with specialized optimizations can achieve state-of-the-art compression performance while being practical for real-world use on consumer hardware.

Abstract: We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama.cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.
  On alice29.txt (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation wireless networks are evolving beyond basic connectivity to incorporate sensing and computing capabilities, creating integrated systems that enable environmental awareness and intelligent applications. However, this integration introduces significant security challenges due to increased system complexity, expanded attack surfaces, and amplified data security/privacy concerns from AI applications.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey approach: 1) Reviews physical-layer security techniques for communication networks; 2) Examines security/privacy implications of semantic/pragmatic communications and cross-layer design; 3) Identifies security risks at signal source, propagation channel, and sensing target levels; 4) Summarizes defense strategies for sensing functionalities; 5) Discusses secure coded computing approaches for distributed computing risks; 6) Proposes unified security frameworks for integrated communication-sensing-computing architectures.

Result: The survey provides a systematic analysis of security threats across integrated wireless systems, identifying vulnerabilities at multiple layers and proposing corresponding defense mechanisms. It offers state-of-the-art security strategies for communication, sensing, and computing components, culminating in end-to-end security frameworks tailored for future integrated wireless architectures.

Conclusion: Integrated wireless systems combining communication, sensing, and computing capabilities require comprehensive security frameworks that address vulnerabilities across all components. The paper establishes a foundation for protecting future wireless networks through unified security approaches that consider the interconnected nature of these systems and their emerging applications.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are progressing beyond conventional connectivity to incorporate emerging sensing and computing capabilities. This convergence gives rise to integrated systems that enable not only uninterrupted communication, but also environmental awareness, intelligent decision-making, and novel applications that take advantage of these combined features. At the same time, this integration brings substantial security challenges. As computing, sensing, and communication become more tightly intertwined, the overall complexity of the system increases, creating new vulnerabilities and expanding the attack surface. The widespread deployment of data-heavy artificial intelligence applications further amplifies concerns regarding data security and privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of security and privacy threats, along with potential countermeasures, in integrated wireless systems. We first review physical-layer security techniques for communication networks, and then investigate the security and privacy implications of semantic and pragmatic communications and their associated cross-layer design methodologies. For sensing functionalities, we pinpoint security and privacy risks at the levels of signal sources, propagation channels, and sensing targets, and summarize state-of-the-art defense strategies for each. The growing computational requirements of these applications drive the need for distributed computing over the network, which introduces additional risks such as data leakage, weak authentication, and multiple points of failure. We subsequently discuss secure coded computing approaches that can help overcome several of these challenges. Finally, we introduce unified security frameworks tailored to integrated communication-sensing-computing architectures, offering an end-to-end perspective on protecting future wireless systems.

*Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Kai-Kit Wong,Masoud Kaveh,Hao Xu,Baiyang Liu,Kin-Fai Tong,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: First comprehensive analysis of enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS) with imperfect CSI via pilot-based channel estimation, revealing SNR saturation in single-user case and interference-limitation in multiuser case, while maintaining performance advantages over conventional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on E-FAS showed substantial power gains under perfect CSI, but the impact of practical channel acquisition on E-FAS performance remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap by analyzing E-FAS-assisted downlink transmission under realistic pilot-based channel estimation.

Method: Developed an estimation framework for equivalent end-to-end channel with closed-form expressions for MMSE channel estimate statistics. Analyzed both single-user and multiuser operation with training overhead. For single-user: characterized outage probability and achievable rate with imperfect CSI. For multiuser: studied zero-forcing precoding with imperfect estimates. Validated via Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarked against LS estimation and conventional non-E-FAS transmission.

Result: Revealed SNR saturation phenomenon in single-user case due to residual self-interference. Showed multiuser system becomes interference-limited in high SNR regime due to residual inter-user interference. Quantified trade-off between spatial multiplexing gains and pilot overhead. Despite CSI imperfections and training costs, E-FAS retains substantial performance advantages and provides robustness through amplified large-scale channel gain.

Conclusion: E-FAS maintains significant performance advantages over conventional systems even with practical channel estimation, demonstrating robustness and practical viability despite CSI imperfections and training overhead constraints.

Abstract: Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS) have recently emerged as a new wireless architecture in which intelligent metasurfaces act as guided electromagnetic interfaces, enabling surface-wave (SW) propagation with much lower attenuation and more control than conventional space-wave transmission. While prior work has reported substantial power gains under perfect channel state information (CSI), the impact of practical channel acquisition on E-FAS performance remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of E-FAS-assisted downlink transmission under pilot-based channel estimation. We develop an estimation framework for the equivalent end-to-end channel and derive closed-form expressions for the statistics of the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate and its estimation error. Building on these results, we analyze both single-user and multiuser operation while explicitly accounting for the training overhead. For the single-user case, we characterize the outage probability and achievable rate with imperfect CSI, and reveal an inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) saturation phenomenon caused by residual self-interference. For the multiuser case, we study zero-forcing (ZF) precoding based on imperfect channel estimates and show that the system becomes interference-limited in the high SNR regime because of residual inter-user interference. Furthermore, we quantify the trade-off between spatial multiplexing gains and pilot overhead when the number of users increases. Analytical findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarked against least-squares (LS) estimation and conventional non-E-FAS transmission. The results reveal that despite CSI imperfections and training costs, E-FAS retains substantial performance advantages and provides robustness enabled by its amplified large-scale channel gain.

Abstract: We present \texttt{ZUNA}, a 380M-parameter masked diffusion autoencoder trained to perform masked channel infilling and superresolution for arbitrary electrode numbers and positions in EEG signals. The \texttt{ZUNA} architecture tokenizes multichannel EEG into short temporal windows and injects spatiotemporal structure via a 4D rotary positional encoding over (x,y,z,t), enabling inference on arbitrary channel subsets and positions. We train ZUNA on an aggregated and harmonized corpus spanning 208 public datasets containing approximately 2 million channel-hours using a combined reconstruction and heavy channel-dropout objective. We show that \texttt{ZUNA} substantially improves over ubiquitous spherical-spline interpolation methods, with the gap widening at higher dropout rates. Crucially, compared to other deep learning methods in this space, \texttt{ZUNA}'s performance \emph{generalizes} across datasets and channel positions allowing it to be applied directly to novel datasets and problems.

*Ibrahim Kilinc,Robert W. Heath*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a heterogeneity-agnostic AI/ML beam selection algorithm that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration, enabling beam selection across diverse hardware without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits the feasibility and generalization of existing AI/ML-based beam selection methods. Current approaches require either a heterogeneity-agnostic model or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive.

Method: 1) Derive an RSRP model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. 2) Propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables (AoA, AoD, and matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization) from beamformed RSRP measurements. 3) Develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining.

Result: Simulation results show the heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses antenna heterogeneity in beam selection by decoupling propagation characteristics from hardware configuration, enabling a single model to work across diverse antenna setups without retraining, achieving near-optimal performance comparable to genie-aided selection.

Abstract: AI/ML-based beam selection methods coupled with location information effectively reduce beam training overhead. Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity.

TL;DR: Dynamic AP selection and pilot power allocation framework for cell-free massive MIMO systems that improves spectral efficiency through correlation-based clustering and optimized pilot power allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate inter-user interference and improve spectral efficiency in uplink cell-free massive MIMO systems, addressing challenges of pilot contamination, network scalability, and frequent CSI updates.

Method: Proposes DAPPA framework with hierarchical correlation-based clustering algorithm for AP grouping, user-capacity constraints per AP, and pilot power allocation formulated as weighted sum-rate maximization problem solved via quadratic transform.

Result: Significant spectral efficiency gains, maintained performance in high-density multi-user scenarios, faster convergence than benchmark schemes, reduced CSI estimation needs, and minimized network-wide update overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed DAPPA framework effectively improves spectral efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO systems through intelligent AP selection and pilot power optimization, offering scalable and practical solution for interference mitigation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic access point (AP) selection and pilot power allocation (DAPPA) framework for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, aiming to mitigate inter-user interference and improve overall spectral efficiency (SE). A hierarchical correlation-based clustering algorithm is developed to group APs according to their channel correlation, enabling each user to be associated with APs that simultaneously provide strong channel gains and low mutual correlation. This association ensures reliable connectivity, maximizes coherent combining gains, and reduces inter-user interference, while also allowing the number of AP clusters to be adjusted flexibly, without the need to reorganize the network completely. By maintaining links to low-correlated APs, the proposed scheme reduces the need for frequent channel state information (CSI) estimation and minimizes network-wide update overhead. To enhance scalability, a user-capacity constraint per AP is incorporated, preventing hardware overload and alleviating the effects of pilot reuse. Furthermore, an effective pilot power allocation strategy is introduced to boost the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) during channel training. This is formulated as a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and solved iteratively using a quadratic transform, which enables efficient optimization while ensuring fairness and high-quality service across all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers significant SE gains, maintains performance in high-density multi-user scenarios, and converges faster than benchmark schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interference management challenges in uplink cell-free massive MIMO systems, particularly pilot contamination and inter-AP redundancy, which degrade spectral efficiency in dense network deployments.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Channel similarity-aware pilot assignment (CAPA) that dynamically allocates orthogonal pilots to users with high channel similarity to mitigate pilot contamination; 2) AP selection algorithm that prioritizes low-correlation APs to reduce interference while maintaining robust UE-AP links and minimizing redundancy.

Result: The combined approach significantly improves spectral efficiency, especially in dense network deployments, with simulation results demonstrating effectiveness under dynamic user equipment scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed channel similarity-aware pilot assignment and AP selection strategies effectively manage interference in cell-free massive MIMO systems, leading to substantial spectral efficiency improvements, making them particularly valuable for dense network deployments.

Abstract: This paper investigates pilot assignment and access point (AP) selection strategies for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. We propose channel similarity-aware pilot assignment (CAPA) and AP selection schemes to improve interference management and, consequently, spectral efficiency (SE). The pilot assignment strategy dynamically allocates pilot sequences by evaluating inter-user channel similarity, ensuring that users (UEs) with high channel similarity are assigned orthogonal pilots to mitigate pilot contamination. Subsequently, an AP selection algorithm is introduced that prioritizes the selection of low-correlation APs to reduce interference and enhance spatial diversity. This selection process maintains robust UE-AP links while minimizing inter-AP redundancy. The combined approach significantly improves SE, particularly in dense network deployments. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under dynamic UE scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimal beamforming solutions for NOMA systems rely on complex iterative algorithms that increase computational burden and latency, making them unsuitable for delay-sensitive applications in future wireless networks.

Method: Proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that uses two representations of channel state information as input features to generate normalized beamforming vectors for downlink NOMA systems, solving the transmit power minimization problem.

Result: Simulation results show the CNN-based solution closely approximates optimal label performance while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional high-complexity algorithms.

Conclusion: The CNN-based beamforming design enhances practicality for real-time applications in wireless networks by providing near-optimal performance with dramatically reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and beamforming are well-established techniques for enabling massive connectivity in future wireless networks. However, many optimal beamforming solutions rely on highly complex iterative algorithms and optimization methods, resulting in an increase in computational burden and latency, making them less suitable for delay-sensitive applications and services. To address these challenges, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for beamforming design in downlink NOMA systems to solve the transmit power minimization problem. The proposed method utilizes two representations of channel state information as input features to produce normalized beamforming vectors. Simulation results show that the CNN-based solution closely approximates the optimal label performance while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional high-complexity algorithms, enhancing its practicality for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-informed Deep Operator Networks require either exact mathematical formulas or huge datasets, but many real-world dynamic systems only provide limited experimental data or partial mathematical information.

Method: 1) Extract short-term dependencies from available data using surrogate ML models, 2) Incorporate these surrogate models as physics information into DeepOnet, 3) Train DeepOnet to simulate dynamic responses for given control inputs and initial conditions.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed DeepOnet framework effectively approximates dynamic responses of nonlinear dynamic systems from limited data.

Conclusion: The framework enables learning nonlinear dynamic systems without requiring exact mathematical formulas or large datasets, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with limited data availability.

Abstract: The existing physical-informed Deep Operator Networks are mostly based on either the well-known mathematical formula of the system or huge amounts of data for different scenarios. However, in some cases, it is difficult to get the exact mathematical formula and vast amounts of data in some dynamic systems, we can only get a few experimental data or limited mathematical information. To address the cases, we propose a data-driven model-free physical-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepOnet) framework to learn the nonlinear dynamic systems from few available data. We first explore the short-term dependence of the available data and use a surrogate machine learning model to extract the short-term dependence. Then, the surrogate machine learning model is incorporated into the DeepOnet as the physical information part. Then, the constructed DeepOnet is trained to simulate the system's dynamic response for given control inputs and initial conditions. Numerical experiments on different systems confirm that our DeepOnet framework learns to approximate the dynamic response of some nonlinear dynamic systems effectively.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DS2D uplink faces challenges due to long distances and UE power limits. This paper proposes an elevation-aware supplementary uplink (SUL) framework that adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on satellite elevation to improve coverage and reliability while maintaining power efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct satellite-to-device communication enables global coverage but faces severe uplink challenges: long propagation distances, severe path loss, and strict UE power limits. These issues are particularly problematic at low elevation angles and beam edges, making uplink reliability a critical concern.

Method: Developed an elevation-aware SUL framework leveraging predictable LEO satellite orbits. The approach adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on elevation-dependent link margin estimates. It schedules UE transmission on either primary uplink carrier or lower-frequency SUL carrier, with an activation algorithm using hysteresis to prevent frequent switching.

Result: Simulation results show the SUL framework extends effective uplink coverage to low-elevation and beam-edge regions, improves uplink availability over satellite passes, and achieves stable operation with minimal uplink transitions under realistic UE power constraints.

Conclusion: Integrating SUL technology into DS2D systems enhances uplink robustness while preserving UE power efficiency. The elevation-aware framework effectively addresses uplink reliability challenges in satellite-to-device communication.

Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication enables standard mobile devices to connect directly to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, providing global coverage without reliance on terrestrial infrastructure. However, the DS2D uplink is fundamentally constrained by long propagation distances, severe path loss, and stringent user equipment (UE) power limits, making uplink reliability particularly challenging at low elevation angles and beam edges. This paper investigates the integration of supplementary uplink (SUL) technology into DS2D systems to enhance uplink robustness while preserving UE power efficiency. Leveraging the predictable geometry of LEO satellite orbits, we develop an elevation-aware SUL framework that adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on elevation-dependent link margin estimates. The proposed approach schedules the UE to transmit on either a primary uplink carrier or a lower-frequency SUL carrier. An elevation-aware SUL activation algorithm with hysteresis is introduced to guide uplink carrier selection while preventing frequent switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SUL framework extends effective uplink coverage toward low-elevation and beam-edge regions, improves uplink availability over a satellite pass, and achieves stable operation with a minimal number of uplink transitions under realistic UE power constraints.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: LFFD is a natural-language-guided scenario generation framework for power systems that uses LLMs to convert text requests into semantic space, employs flow diffusion models for efficient generation, and addresses frequency bias through multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-based scenario generation methods (like Conditional GANs) rely on fixed-length numerical conditioning vectors, which limit user convenience and generation flexibility. There's a need for more intuitive natural language interfaces for power system scenario generation.

Method: 1) Pretrained LLM module converts natural language requests into ordered semantic space. 2) Flow diffusion model with rectified flow matching objective for efficient high-quality generation using LLM outputs. 3) Frequency-aware multi-objective optimization to mitigate frequency bias. 4) Dual-agent framework for creating text-scenario training pairs and semantic evaluation standardization.

Result: Experiments on large-scale photovoltaic and load datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LFFD method for natural-language-guided scenario generation in power systems.

Conclusion: LFFD provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for power system scenario generation using natural language, addressing limitations of existing numerical conditioning approaches while maintaining generation quality through flow diffusion and frequency-aware optimization.

Abstract: Diverse and controllable scenario generation (e.g., wind, solar, load, etc.) is critical for robust power system planning and operation. As AI-based scenario generation methods are becoming the mainstream, existing methods (e.g., Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets) mainly rely on a fixed-length numerical conditioning vector to control the generation results, facing challenges in user conveniency and generation flexibility. In this paper, a natural-language-guided scenario generation framework, named LLM-enabled Frequency-aware Flow Diffusion (LFFD), is proposed to enable users to generate desired scenarios using plain human language. First, a pretrained LLM module is introduced to convert generation requests described by unstructured natural languages into ordered semantic space. Second, instead of using standard diffusion models, a flow diffusion model employing a rectified flow matching objective is introduced to achieve efficient and high-quality scenario generation, taking the LLM output as the model input. During the model training process, a frequency-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm is introduced to mitigate the frequency-bias issue. Meanwhile, a dual-agent framework is designed to create text-scenario training sample pairs as well as to standardize semantic evaluation. Experiments based on large-scale photovoltaic and load datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor networks need multiple equally-informative node subsets activated sequentially to ensure robustness against battery drain and sensor failures. The quality of these subsets changes dynamically, requiring adaptation to these changes.

Method: Graph node partitioning method based on sampling theory for graph signals, formulated as difference-of-convex (DC) optimization with subspace prior. Solved using proximal DC algorithm with convergence guarantee. For online scenarios, adaptively estimates signal subspace from historical data and sequentially updates the partitioning prior.

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world sensor network data show the proposed method achieves lower average mean squared errors compared to alternative methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic sensor scheduling method effectively creates multiple informative node subsets that adapt to changing conditions, improving robustness and reducing reconstruction error in sensor networks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic sensor scheduling method for sensor networks. In sensor network applications, we often need multiple equally-informative node subsets that are activated sequentially to make a sensor network robust against concentrated battery consumption and sensor failures. In addition, quality of these subsets changes dynamically and thus we must adapt those changes. To find those node subsets, we propose a graph node partitioning method based on sampling theory for graph signals. We aim to minimize the average reconstruction error for signals obtained at all node subsets, in contrast to conventional single subset selection. The graph node partitioning problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization based on a subspace prior of graph signals, and is solved by the proximal DC algorithm. It guarantees convergence to a critical point. To accommodate the online scenario where the signal subspace and optimal partitioning may change over time, we adaptively estimate the signal subspace from historical data and sequentially update the prior for our partitioning method. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world sensor network data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower average mean squared errors compared to alternative methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC systems create new sensing-based security vulnerabilities where eavesdroppers can intercept confidential messages and exploit target echoes to infer sensing parameters without users' awareness. Current research lacks joint protection for both sensing and communication security in ISAC systems.

Method: Two-layer dual-secure ISAC framework: 1) Joint transmit beamformer design to inject artificial noise that interferes with communication eavesdroppers, while deliberately distorting reference signals available to sensing eavesdroppers; 2) Generation of artificial ghosts with fake angle-range-velocity profiles observable by all receivers, which legitimate receivers can suppress but sensing eavesdroppers cannot.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate the framework effectively enhances both communication and sensing security while preserving performance for legitimate communication users and sensing receivers. The approach significantly reduces sensing eavesdroppers' probability of correctly detecting true targets.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-secure ISAC framework successfully addresses the joint protection challenge for sensing and communication security against passive eavesdroppers without requiring their CSI, offering a comprehensive security solution for ISAC systems.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the efficient sharing of wireless resources to support emerging applications, but it also gives rise to new sensing-based security vulnerabilities. Here, potential communication security threats whereby confidential messages intended for legitimate users are intercepted, but also unauthorized receivers (Eves) can passively exploit target echoes to infer sensing parameters without users being aware. Despite these risks, the joint protection of sensing and communication security in ISAC systems remains unexplored. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-layer dual-secure ISAC framework that simultaneously protects sensing and communication against passive sensing Eves and communication Eves, without requiring their channel state information (CSI). Specifically, transmit beamformers are jointly designed to inject artificial noise (AN) to introduce interference to communication Eves, while deliberately distorting the reference signal available to sensing Eves to impair their sensing capability. Furthermore, the proposed design generates artificial ghosts (AGs) with fake angle-range-velocity profiles observable by all receivers. Legitimate receivers can suppress these AGs, whereas sensing Eves cannot, thereby significantly reducing their probability of correctly detecting the true targets. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances both communication and sensing security, while preserving the performance of communication users and legitimate sensing receivers.

TL;DR: Researchers developed regression models to correct Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) measurements of surgical smoke for humidity and temperature variations, eliminating the need for strict environmental control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMS measurements are highly dependent on humidity and temperature, making comparisons across different environmental conditions arbitrary. The standard approach of regulating environmental conditions is often impractical or impossible for real-world applications.

Method: Analyzed 1,852 DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine adipose and muscle tissue. Fitted regression models to both raw and normalized DMS data, then used these models to estimate DMS measurements based on recorded humidity and temperatures. Standardized measurements separation voltage-wise before training multivariate regression models.

Result: Confirmed clear dependence of DMS measurements on humidity and temperature. Demonstrated that it's possible to estimate DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine tissues under specific environmental conditions using the developed regression approach.

Conclusion: The regression modeling approach represents the first step toward removing the need for standardized measurement conditions in DMS analysis of surgical smoke, potentially enabling wider practical application of this technology.

Abstract: Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS), also known as Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry, is a rapid and affordable technology for extracting information from gas phase samples containing complex volatile organic compounds, and can therefore be used for analyzing surgical smoke. One obstacle to its widespread application is the dependence of DMS measurements on humidity and, to a lesser degree, temperature, making comparison of data measured under different environmental conditions arbitrary. The commonly used solution is to regulate these environmental conditions to some predefined humidity and temperature levels. However, this approach is often unfeasible or even impossible. Therefore, in this paper we analyzed a dataset of 1,852 DMS measurements of surgical smoke evaporated from porcine adipose and muscle tissue to get an understanding of the impact of varying humidity and temperature on DMS measurements. Our analysis confirmed clear dependence of the measurements on these two factors. To overcome this challenge, we fitted regression models to raw and normalized DMS measurement data. Subsequently, these models were used for estimating DMS measurements for known tissue types based on recorded humidity and temperatures. Our test suggests that it is possible to estimate DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine adipose and muscle tissue under specific environmental conditions by standardizing DMS measurements separation voltage-wise and training multivariate regression models on the normalized data, which is the first step in removing the need for standardized measurement conditions.

### [308] [Active IoT User Detection in Near-Field with Location Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19613)
*Gabriel Martins de Jesus,Richard Demo Souza,Onel Luis Alcaraz López*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a location-aided active users detection (AUD) method for near-field IoT networks that leverages users' location information to reconstruct LoS channel components, improving detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve active users detection in near-field IoT networks by exploiting prior knowledge of users' locations, which can enhance the correlation between received signals and active users, especially in scenarios with strong line-of-sight components.

Method: The method involves: 1) Using location estimates to reconstruct users' LoS channel components, 2) Combining reconstructed channels with users' pilot sequences to enhance signal correlation, 3) Formulating location-aided AUD as a convex optimization problem, and 4) Solving it via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Result: Simulation results show that under perfect location estimation and strong LoS conditions, the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline ADMM approach without location information. The method remains robust under imperfect location estimation as long as errors stay within system-determined bounds.

Conclusion: Location information can effectively enhance active users detection in near-field IoT networks, providing significant performance gains despite increased computational complexity. The approach is practical for both static users (who can readily inform their locations) and mobile users (via established localization algorithms).

Abstract: In this paper, we address active users detection (AUD) in near-field Internet of Things (IoT) networks by exploring prior knowledge of users' locations. We consider a scenario where users are distributed in a semi-circular area within the Rayleigh distance of a multi-antenna base station (BS). We propose the BS to use location estimates of the users to reconstruct their line-of-sight (LoS) channel components, hence assisting the AUD process. For this, the BS combines these reconstructed channels with users' pilot sequences, enhancing the correlation between received signals and active users. We formulate the location-aided AUD as a convex optimization problem, solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). {Our proposal has a higher computational complexity compared to the baseline ADMM approach where location information is not used. Moreover, the proposal requires location information of users, which can be readily informed if users are static, or inferred via established localization algorithms if they are mobile.} Simulation results compare our proposal against the baseline across varying systems parameters, such as number of users, pilot length and LoS component strength. We demonstrate that under perfect location estimation and strong LoS, our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline. Furthermore, robustness analysis shows that performance gains persist under imperfect location estimation, provided the estimation error remains within bounds determined by the system parameters.

TL;DR: Applying topological signal processing to 3D point clouds using simplicial complexes and higher-order Laplacians for joint geometry and attribute processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a topological framework for analyzing 3D point clouds that can simultaneously process both color attributes (on nodes) and geometry (on triangle barycenters), overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.

Method: Builds on Discrete Exterior Calculus theory to introduce higher-order Laplacian operators for processing signals over triangular meshes. Represents point clouds on simplicial complexes and treats attributes as edge signals for sampling, recovery, and filtering.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate accurate color reconstruction with robustness to sparse data, and effective geometry refinement for noisy point cloud coordinates.

Conclusion: The proposed topological signal processing approach provides an effective framework for characterizing both geometry and attributes of 3D point clouds through topology-based representations.

Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to apply the topological signal processing (TSP) framework to the analysis of 3D Point Clouds (PCs) represented on simplicial complexes. Building on Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) theory for vector fields, we introduce higher-order Laplacian operators that enable the processing of signals over triangular meshes. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach allows us to characterize both color attributes, modeled as 3D vectors on nodes, and geometry, modeled as 3D vectors on the barycenter of each triangle. Then, we show as TSP tools may efficiently be used to sample, recover and filter PCs attributes treating them as edge signals. Numerical results on synthetic PCs demonstrate accurate color reconstruction with robustness to sparse data and geometry refinement in the case of noisy PC coordinates. The proposed approach provides a topology-based representation to characterize the geometry and attributes of PCs.

TL;DR: SonoTraceUE is a high-fidelity acoustic simulation framework for Unreal Engine that enables near real-time simulation of acoustic sensing in dynamic environments using ray tracing and diffraction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current acoustic simulation frameworks struggle with computational costs for high-frequency wave propagation in large, dynamic environments. Wave-based methods are accurate but don't scale well, while geometric acoustic solvers lack support for dynamic scenes, complex diffraction, and robotic integration.

Method: Built as a plugin for Unreal Engine, using hardware-accelerated ray tracing-based specular reflection model and curvature-based Monte Carlo diffraction model for active and passive acoustic sensing simulation.

Result: The framework achieves high correlation with real-world spectral and spatial data, validated through bioacoustic studies and robotics experiments. Enables near real-time simulation in dynamic, multi-material environments.

Conclusion: SonoTraceUE provides a versatile platform for synthetic data generation, bioacoustics hypothesis testing, and rapid prototyping of closed-loop robotic systems using acoustic sensing.

Abstract: The deployment of in-air acoustic sensors for industrial monitoring and autonomous robotics has grown significantly, often drawing inspiration from biological echolocation. However, developing and validating these systems in existing simulation frameworks remains challenging due to the computational cost of simulating high-frequency wave propagation in large, dynamic, and complex environments. While wave-based methods offer high accuracy, they scale poorly with frequency and volume. Conversely, existing geometric acoustic solvers often lack support for dynamic scenes, complex diffraction, or closed-loop robotic integration. In this work, we introduce SonoTraceUE, a high-fidelity acoustic simulation framework built as a plugin for Unreal Engine. By using a hardware-accelerated ray tracing-based specular reflection model, and a curvature-based Monte Carlo diffraction model, the system enables near real-time simulation of active and passive acoustic sensing in dynamic, multi-material environments. We validate the framework through two distinct experimental domains: a bioacoustic study and a robotics experiment. Our results demonstrate that SonoTraceUE achieves high correlation with real-world spectral and spatial data. The framework provides a versatile platform for synthetic data generation, hypothesis testing in bioacoustics, and the rapid prototyping of closed-loop robotic systems that use acoustic sensing.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Two frameworks for OFDM-based radar/ISAC systems to handle targets beyond cyclic prefix range, addressing ISI/ICI interference trade-off between computational cost and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In OFDM-based radar and ISAC systems, sensing range is limited by cyclic prefix duration. Targets beyond this range cause ISI/ICI interference that degrades detection, raises interference-noise floor, and reduces signal power. Existing methods struggle with trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference, especially in multi-target scenarios.

Method: Two frameworks: 1) Joint-interference cancellation with coherent compensation - an efficient evolution of successive-interference cancellation using high-precision chirp Z-transform estimation and frequency-domain coherent compensation to recover weak distant targets. 2) Full reconstruction-based sliding window scheme - shifts receive window to capture optimal signal energy while performing full-signal reconstruction for all detected targets.

Result: Numerical results show both methods outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks. The paper demonstrates that ISI/ICI-oriented interference often dominates thermal noise in high-dynamic-range scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks resolve the dilemma of trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference in OFDM-based radar/ISAC systems, offering flexible trade-off between computational cost and target detection performance for targets beyond cyclic prefix range.

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based radar and integrated sensing and communication systems, the sensing range is traditionally limited by the round-trip time corresponding to the cyclic prefix duration. Targets whose echoes arrive after this duration induce intersymbol interference (ISI) and associated intercarrier interference (ICI), which significantly degrade detection performance, elevate the interference-noise floor in the radar image, and reduce the useful signal power due to window mismatch. Existing methods face a trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference, particularly in multi-target scenarios. This paper proposes two frameworks to resolve this dilemma, offering a flexible trade-off between computational cost and target detection performance. First, a signal model is derived, demonstrating that ISI and ICI-oriented interference often dominates thermal noise in high-dynamic-range scenarios. To combat the ISI and ICI-based interference-noise floor increase, joint-interference cancellation with coherent compensation is proposed. This approach is an efficient evolution of the successive-interference cancellation algorithm, utilizing high-precision chirp Z-transform estimation and frequency-domain coherent compensation to recover weak distant targets. For scenarios requiring maximum precision, the full reconstruction-based sliding window scheme is presented, which shifts the receive window to capture optimal signal energy while performing full-signal reconstruction for all detected targets. Numerical results show that both methods outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks.

*Kurt Butler,Damian Machlanski,Panagiotis Dimitrakopoulos,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Causal discovery methods are sensitive to sampling rate and window length mismatches with underlying biological/physical event timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observations in causal discovery are recorded at regular intervals that may not match the timing of actual biological/physical events, creating potential mismatches that could affect causal inference accuracy.

Method: Examine sensitivity through empirical and theoretical analysis of how causal discovery performance changes with sampling rate and window length variations.

Result: Both classical and recent causal discovery methods show sensitivity to sampling rate and window length hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Signal processing concepts may help understand and address these sensitivity issues in causal discovery methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery problems use a set of observations to deduce causality between variables in the real world, typically to answer questions about biological or physical systems. These observations are often recorded at regular time intervals, determined by a user or a machine, depending on the experiment design. There is generally no guarantee that the timing of these recordings matches the timing of the underlying biological or physical events. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of causal discovery methods to this potential mismatch. We consider empirical and theoretical evidence to understand how causal discovery performance is impacted by changes of sampling rate and window length. We demonstrate that both classical and recent causal discovery methods exhibit sensitivity to these hyperparameters, and we discuss how ideas from signal processing may help us understand these phenomena.

*Jiechen Chen,Michele Polese,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: C-STLL is a conformal signal temporal logic learning framework that learns interpretable temporal formulas from KPI data to predict QoE outcomes with formal reliability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softwarized RANs generate rich KPI streams, but bridging low-level KPIs to high-level QoE requirements needs methods that are both relevant (capturing predictive temporal patterns) and interpretable (providing human-readable insights for operators).

Method: C-STLL combines signal temporal logic (STL) with conformal calibration using the Learn Then Test framework. It learns interpretable STL formulas that distinguish KPI traces satisfying QoE requirements, with formal guarantees through hypothesis testing-based acceptance and stopping rules.

Result: Experiments using ns-3 network simulator on mobile gaming scenarios show C-STLL effectively controls risk below target levels while returning compact, diverse sets of interpretable temporal specifications linking KPI behavior to QoE outcomes.

Conclusion: C-STLL provides a reliable framework for extracting actionable intelligence from RAN KPIs, offering both interpretability for operators and formal guarantees on prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Softwarized radio access networks (RANs), such as those based on the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture, generate rich streams of key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be leveraged to extract actionable intelligence for network optimization. However, bridging the gap between low-level KPI measurements and high-level requirements, such as quality of experience (QoE), requires methods that are both relevant, capturing temporal patterns predictive of user-level outcomes, and interpretable, providing human-readable insights that operators can validate and act upon. This paper introduces conformal signal temporal logic learning (C-STLL), a framework that addresses both requirements. C-STLL leverages signal temporal logic (STL), a formal language for specifying temporal properties of time series, to learn interpretable formulas that distinguish KPI traces satisfying high-level requirements from those that do not. To ensure reliability, C-STLL wraps around existing STL learning algorithms with a conformal calibration procedure based on the Learn Then Test (LTT) framework. This procedure produces a set of STL formulas with formal guarantees: with high probability, the set contains at least one formula achieving a user-specified accuracy level. The calibration jointly optimizes for reliability, formula complexity, and diversity through principled acceptance and stopping rules validated via multiple hypothesis testing. Experiments using the ns-3 network simulator on a mobile gaming scenario demonstrate that C-STLL effectively controls risk below target levels while returning compact, diverse sets of interpretable temporal specifications that relate KPI behavior to QoE outcomes.

TL;DR: MERA tensor networks are equivalent to paraunitary filter banks, enabling learning of adaptive orthogonal wavelets with perfect reconstruction guarantees, outperforming classical wavelets for fractal-like network traffic compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical wavelets have fixed bases optimized for polynomial smoothness but perform poorly on signals with fractal spectral signatures. Learned methods offer adaptivity but sacrifice structural guarantees like perfect reconstruction.

Method: Establishes equivalence between MERA tensor networks and paraunitary filter banks, enabling manifold-constrained optimization that learns adaptive wavelets while enforcing exact orthogonality and perfect reconstruction.

Result: Learned filters outperform classical wavelets by 0.5-3.8 dB PSNR on six MAWI backbone network traffic traces (2020-2025, 314 Mbps-1.75 Gbps) while preserving Hurst exponent within estimation uncertainty (|ΔH| ≤ 0.03).

Conclusion: MERA-inspired wavelets provide a principled approach for telemetry compression in 6G digital twin synchronization, combining adaptivity with structural guarantees of orthogonality and perfect reconstruction.

Abstract: Classical orthogonal wavelets guarantee perfect reconstruction but rely on fixed bases optimized for polynomial smoothness, achieving suboptimal compression on signals with fractal spectral signatures. Conversely, learned methods offer adaptivity but typically enforce orthogonality via soft penalties, sacrificing structural guarantees.
  This work establishes a rigorous equivalence between Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) tensor networks and paraunitary filter banks. The resulting framework learns adaptive wavelets while enforcing exact orthogonality through manifold-constrained optimization, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction and energy conservation throughout training.
  Validation on Long-Range Dependent (LRD) network traffic demonstrates that learned filters outperform classical wavelets by 0.5--3.8~dB PSNR on six MAWI backbone traces (2020--2025, 314~Mbps--1.75~Gbps) while preserving the Hurst exponent within estimation uncertainty ($|ΔH| \le 0.03$). These results establish MERA-inspired wavelets as a principled approach for telemetry compression in 6G digital twin synchronization.

TL;DR: Experimental study shows sub-THz channel characteristics remain spatially consistent over tens of centimeters in indoor environments, enabling coarser ray-tracing grids and reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ray tracing for sub-THz channel modeling requires extremely fine spatial resolution due to millimeter wavelengths, leading to huge computational demands. However, practical channel characteristics may remain similar over larger distances, potentially reducing computational effort.

Method: Conducted large-scale measurement campaign in 140-150 GHz band in indoor-hall environment, characterizing channels at separation distances from 2.5 mm up to 1 meter to assess spatial consistency.

Result: Channel characteristics (delay spread, angular delay spread, K-factor) change only slightly over multiple tens of centimeter distances. Mesh grid can be 10-50 wavelengths along stable LoS directions, but finer resolution needed in non-LoS dominated regions.

Conclusion: Spatial consistency in sub-THz channels allows for coarser ray-tracing grids in stable LoS regions, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Advanced interpolation needed for coarser grids in rapidly varying scattered regions.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a versatile approach for precise sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100-300 GHz) channel modeling when designing new mechanisms for beyond-6G cellular systems. Theoretically, wireless channels may exhibit variations over wavelength distances. In the sub-THz band, close-to-millimeter wavelengths thus require extremely large computational efforts for ray-tracing modeling. However, in practice, channel characteristics may remain quantitatively similar over much larger distances, which can drastically decrease computational efforts. The aim of this study is to experimentally characterize the degree of spatial consistency in sub-THz channel characteristics. To this end, we performed a large-scale measurement campaign in the 140-150 GHz frequency band in an indoor-hall (InH) environment and characterized the channel at separation distances from 2.5 mm up to 1 m. Our results show that channel characteristics including delay spread, angular delay spread, and K-factor change only slightly over multiple tens of centimeter distances. This implies that, in the considered InH environment, the mesh grid can be in the range of 10-50 wavelengths (at 145 GHz) along stable line-of-sight (LoS) directions, while a finer resolution is needed in regions not dominated by LoS. For coarser grids, advanced interpolation is required to capture rapidly varying scattered components.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Correction timing provides valuable learning signals for robots beyond just treating corrections as demonstrations or preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treats corrections as demonstrations or preferences but overlooks the human's decision to intervene, which contains valuable information about task progress, alignment with expectations, and other factors.

Method: Investigated three applications of correction timing signal: (1) identifying motion features that prompt corrections, (2) quickly inferring correction goals from timing and initial direction, and (3) learning more precise task constraints.

Result: Correction timing improved learning for the first two applications (identifying problematic motion features and quickly inferring correction goals).

Conclusion: Correction timing offers valuable learning signals for robots, providing new insights beyond traditional correction interpretation methods.

Abstract: Corrections offer a natural modality for people to provide feedback to a robot, by (i) intervening in the robot's behavior when they believe the robot is failing (or will fail) the task objectives and (ii) modifying the robot's behavior to successfully fulfill the task. Each correction offers information on what the robot should and should not do, where the corrected behavior is more aligned with task objectives than the original behavior. Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives. Our results indicate that correction timing results in improved learning for the first two of these applications. Overall, our work provides new insights on the value of correction timing as a signal for robot learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVerSeeC is a zero-shot modular framework that generates global costmaps from satellite imagery using natural language mission directives, handling novel entities and compositional preferences without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for aerial navigation planning rely on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings, which cannot accommodate varying mission requirements, unknown terrain entities at deployment, and compositional traversal logic expressed in natural language prompts.

Method: A three-step modular framework: (1) LLM interprets natural language to extract entities and ranked preferences, (2) open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline locates these entities in high-resolution satellite imagery, (3) LLM synthesizes executable costmap code using user preferences and entity masks.

Result: OVerSeeC successfully handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning without requiring retraining for new entities or mission requirements.

Abstract: Aerial imagery provides essential global context for autonomous navigation, enabling route planning at scales inaccessible to onboard sensing. We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning.

TL;DR: FORMICA enables multi-robot task allocation without communication by predicting teammates' bids and adjusting choices accordingly, achieving near-optimal performance with minimal training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-robot task allocation methods rely heavily on communication, which fails in bandwidth-limited, degraded, or adversarial environments. There's a need for coordination without robot-to-robot communication.

Method: Learning-based framework using Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) to predict bid distributions and minimize Task Allocation Regret. Uses mean-field approximation to scale to large swarms by predicting distribution of competing bids rather than individual bids.

Result: FORMICA improves system reward by 17% over baseline in 16 robots/64 tasks scenarios, approaching optimal MILP solution. Generalizes well to larger scenarios (256 robots/4096 tasks) with 7% improvement. Training takes only 21 seconds on a laptop.

Conclusion: FORMICA demonstrates that implicit coordination through learned bid prediction enables effective multi-robot task allocation without communication, with strong performance, scalability, and rapid adaptation to new environments.

Abstract: Most multi-robot task allocation methods rely on communication to resolve conflicts and reach consistent assignments. In environments with limited bandwidth, degraded infrastructure, or adversarial interference, existing approaches degrade sharply. We introduce a learning-based framework that achieves high-quality task allocation without any robot-to-robot communication. The key idea is that robots coordinate implicitly by predicting teammates' bids: if each robot can anticipate competition for a task, it can adjust its choices accordingly. Our method predicts bid distributions to correct systematic errors in analytical mean-field approximations. While analytical predictions assume idealized conditions (uniform distributions, known bid functions), our learned approach adapts to task clustering and spatial heterogeneity. Inspired by Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO), we train predictors end-to-end to minimize Task Allocation Regret rather than prediction error. To scale to large swarms, we develop a mean-field approximation where each robot predicts the distribution of competing bids rather than individual bids, reducing complexity from $O(NT)$ to $O(T)$. We call our approach FORMICA: Field-Oriented Regret-Minimizing Implicit Coordination Algorithm. Experiments show FORMICA substantially outperforms a natural analytical baseline. In scenarios with 16 robots and 64 tasks, our approach improves system reward by 17% and approaches the optimal MILP solution. When deployed on larger scenarios (256 robots, 4096 tasks), the same model improves performance by 7%, demonstrating strong generalization. Training requires only 21 seconds on a laptop, enabling rapid adaptation to new environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged locomotion benefits from embodied sensing where perception emerges from physical interaction. Current systems lack rich tactile feedback from foot-ground interactions that could improve stability and environmental awareness.

Method: Developed a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor with a skin-like deformable layer that optically captures contact deformations. From contact image streams, the method estimates contact pose, visualizes shear, computes center of pressure, classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of contact patches.

Result: Validated on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. The system successfully estimates contact parameters and detects terrain features.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

Abstract: Legged locomotion benefits from embodied sensing, where perception emerges from the physical interaction between body and environment. We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer that captures contact deformations optically, turning foot-ground interactions into rich haptic signals. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose (position and orientation), visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of the contact patch. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. These findings suggest that integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends closed-loop inverse kinematics to infinite-dimensional soft robots by learning actuation-to-shape mapping with neural operators and applying infinite-dimensional chain rule for Jacobian-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kinematic inversion is challenging for underactuated soft robots with infinite degrees of freedom. Existing CLIK methods assume finite dimensions, limiting their application to soft robots where full-body shape information is important.

Method: 1) Compose actuation-to-shape map with shape-to-task map, 2) Derive differential end-to-end kinematics via infinite-dimensional chain rule, 3) Learn actuation-to-shape mapping from simulation data using differentiable neural operator networks, 4) Apply to Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm.

Result: Developed infinite-dimensional CLIK framework for soft robots, validated analytically on constant-curvature segment and applied to three-fiber soft robotic arm using morphoelasticity and active filament theory models.

Conclusion: Enables differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in continuous, infinite-dimensional framework, opening new possibilities for soft robot control.

Abstract: While kinematic inversion is a purely geometric problem for fully actuated rigid robots, it becomes extremely challenging for underactuated soft robots with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) schemes address this by introducing end-to-end mappings from actuation to task space for the controller to operate on, but typically assume finite dimensions of the underlying virtual configuration space. In this work, we extend CLIK to the infinite-dimensional domain to reason about the entire soft robot shape while solving tasks. We do this by composing an actuation-to-shape map with a shape-to-task map, deriving the differential end-to-end kinematics via an infinite-dimensional chain rule, and thereby obtaining a Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm. Since the actuation-to-shape mapping is rarely available in closed form, we propose to learn it from simulation data using neural operator networks, which are differentiable. We first present an analytical study on a constant-curvature segment, and then apply the neural version of the algorithm to a three-fiber soft robotic arm whose underlying model relies on morphoelasticity and active filament theory. This opens new possibilities for differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in a continuous, infinite-dimensional framework.

*Saitarun Nadipineni,Keshav Pandiyan,Kaspar Althoefer,Shinichi Hirai,Thilina Dulantha Lalitharatne*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers developed tunable soft physical twins that mimic fruit stiffness for robotic gripper testing, achieving 97-99% accuracy in replicating kiwi fruit stiffness at different ripeness levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The agri-food sector faces labor shortages and supply chain issues, leading to unharvested produce losses. Robotic harvesting shows promise but evaluating soft grippers for delicate fruits is difficult due to variable mechanical properties of natural produce. Current testing requires large quantities of real fruit, causing inefficiency, high costs, and waste.

Method: Developed tunable soft physical twins that emulate fruit stiffness characteristics at different ripeness levels. Created a fiber-reinforced pneumatic physical twin of a kiwi fruit designed to replicate stiffness variations. Tested stiffness tuning accuracy, performed gripping tasks with commercial robotic gripper using sensor feedback, and conducted stress tests over 50 cycles.

Result: Physical twin stiffness can be tuned accurately (97.35-99.43% accuracy). Sensor feedback from the twin effectively reflects applied gripping forces. Stress testing over 50 cycles showed reliable stiffness maintenance (0.56-1.10% error).

Conclusion: Robotic physical twins can adjust stiffness to resemble real fruits, providing a sustainable, controllable platform for benchmarking and training robotic grippers, addressing current inefficiencies in testing practices.

Abstract: The global agri-food sector faces increasing challenges from labour shortages, high consumer demand, and supply-chain disruptions, resulting in substantial losses of unharvested produce. Robotic harvesting has emerged as a promising alternative; however, evaluating and training soft grippers for delicate fruits remains difficult due to the highly variable mechanical properties of natural produce. This makes it difficult to establish reliable benchmarks or data-driven control strategies. Existing testing practices rely on large quantities of real fruit to capture this variability, leading to inefficiency, higher costs, and waste. The methodology presented in this work aims to address these limitations by developing tunable soft physical twins that emulate the stiffness characteristics of real fruits at different ripeness levels. A fiber-reinforced pneumatic physical twin of a kiwi fruit was designed and fabricated to replicate the stiffness at different ripeness levels. Experimental results show that the stiffness of the physical twin can be tuned accurately over multiple trials (97.35 - 99.43% accuracy). Gripping tasks with a commercial robotic gripper showed that sensor feedback from the physical twin can reflect the applied gripping forces. Finally, a stress test was performed over 50 cycles showed reliable maintenance of desired stiffness (0.56 - 1.10% error). This work shows promise that robotic physical twins could adjust their stiffness to resemble that of real fruits. This can provide a sustainable, controllable platform for benchmarking and training robotic grippers.

*Harry Robertshaw,Nikola Fischer,Lennart Karstensen,Benjamin Jackson,Xingyu Chen,S. M. Hadi Sadati,Christos Bergeles,Alejandro Granados,Thomas C Booth*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HM-MARL framework enables autonomous two-device navigation for mechanical thrombectomy using hierarchical modular multi-agent RL, achieving successful in vitro navigation but facing challenges with left-side anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanical thrombectomy is optimal for acute ischemic stroke but has limited access due to geographic/logistical barriers. Autonomous navigation could expand access, but current RL approaches struggle with generalization across complex 'long' navigation tasks.

Method: Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent RL (HM-MARL) decomposes complex two-device navigation (guide catheter + guidewire) into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. Validated in both in silico (simulation) and in vitro (physical testbed) environments.

Result: In silico: 92-100% success on single vasculature, 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro: 100% success to right common carotid artery, 80% to right ICA, but failed on left-side due to anatomy/catheter limitations. First demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature.

Conclusion: HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies but simulation-to-real transition presents challenges. Future work will refine RL with world models and validate on unseen in vitro data to advance autonomous MT towards clinical translation.

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is typically the optimal treatment for acute ischemic stroke involving large vessel occlusions, but access is limited due to geographic and logistical barriers. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in autonomous endovascular navigation, but generalization across 'long' navigation tasks remains challenging. We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature. While HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies, the simulation-to-real transition introduces challenges. Future work will refine RL strategies using world models and validate performance on unseen in vitro data, advancing autonomous MT towards clinical translation.

### [324] [Systematic Analysis of Coupling Effects on Closed-Loop and Open-Loop Performance in Aerial Continuum Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18684)
*Niloufar Amiri,Shayan Sepahvand,Iraj Mantegh,Farrokh Janabi-Sharifi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares decoupled vs. coupled dynamic models for aerial continuum manipulators, finding that while open-loop simulations show significant differences, the decoupled model achieves comparable closed-loop tracking accuracy with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when a computationally cheaper decoupled dynamic model can achieve accuracy comparable to a more complex coupled model for aerial continuum manipulators, balancing computational efficiency with modeling fidelity.

Method: 1) Derived system dynamics using Euler-Lagrange method with PCC assumption and singularity treatment; 2) Created decoupled model by neglecting coupling terms; 3) Developed novel DPD-SM-IBVS controller for visual servoing; 4) Compared both models in open-loop simulations and closed-loop experiments with moving targets.

Result: Open-loop simulations showed significant discrepancies between models under varying torque inputs and arm parameters. However, closed-loop experiments demonstrated that the decoupled model achieved subpixel tracking accuracy comparable to the coupled model while requiring lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The decoupled dynamic model is sufficient for closed-loop control of aerial continuum manipulators, offering computational efficiency without sacrificing tracking accuracy, making it suitable for real-time control applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates two distinct approaches to the dynamic modeling of aerial continuum manipulators (ACMs): the decoupled and the coupled formulations. Both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors of a representative ACM are analyzed. The primary objective is to determine the conditions under which the decoupled model attains accuracy comparable to the coupled model while offering reduced computational cost under identical numerical conditions. The system dynamics are first derived using the Euler--Lagrange method under the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, with explicit treatment of the near-zero curvature singularity. A decoupled model is then obtained by neglecting the coupling terms in the ACM dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of open-loop responses under diverse actuation profiles and external wrenches. To extend the analysis to closed-loop performance, a novel dynamics-based proportional-derivative sliding mode image-based visual servoing (DPD-SM-IBVS) controller is developed for regulating image feature errors in the presence of a moving target. The controller is implemented with both coupled and decoupled models, allowing a direct comparison of their effectiveness. The open-loop simulations reveal pronounced discrepancies between the two modeling approaches, particularly under varying torque inputs and continuum arm parameters. Conversely, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the decoupled model achieves tracking accuracy on par with the coupled model (within subpixel error) while incurring lower computational cost.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scout-rover cooperation framework using legged robots to map terrain strength and wheeled rovers to safely navigate deformable planetary surfaces like Martian dunes and lunar craters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many scientifically valuable planetary regions (Martian dunes, lunar craters) are hazardous due to loose, deformable regolith that limits rover access. Current systems lack real-time terrain assessment capabilities for safe navigation in such environments.

Method: Hybrid team of legged and wheeled robots: a legged scout robot uses proprioceptive leg-terrain interactions to estimate regolith strength during locomotion and construct terrain maps. These maps are integrated with rover locomotion models to estimate traversal risk and inform path planning.

Result: Validated at NASA Ames Lunar Simulant Testbed and White Sands Dune Field. Demonstrated: (1) online terrain strength mapping from legged locomotion, (2) rover-specific traversal-risk estimation enabling safe navigation. Scout-generated maps reliably capture spatial variability and predict mobility failure modes.

Conclusion: The framework combines embodied terrain sensing with heterogeneous rover cooperation to enhance operational robustness and expand reachable science workspace in deformable planetary environments, enabling safe access to previously hazardous regions.

Abstract: Robot-aided exploration of planetary surfaces is essential for understanding geologic processes, yet many scientifically valuable regions, such as Martian dunes and lunar craters, remain hazardous due to loose, deformable regolith. We present a scout-rover cooperation framework that expands safe access to such terrain using a hybrid team of legged and wheeled robots. In our approach, a high-mobility legged robot serves as a mobile scout, using proprioceptive leg-terrain interactions to estimate regolith strength during locomotion and construct spatially resolved terrain maps. These maps are integrated with rover locomotion models to estimate traversal risk and inform path planning.
  We validate the framework through analogue missions at the NASA Ames Lunar Simulant Testbed and the White Sands Dune Field. Experiments demonstrate (1) online terrain strength mapping from legged locomotion and (2) rover-specific traversal-risk estimation enabling safe navigation to scientific targets. Results show that scout-generated terrain maps reliably capture spatial variability and predict mobility failure modes, allowing risk-aware path planning that avoids hazardous regions. By combining embodied terrain sensing with heterogeneous rover cooperation, this framework enhances operational robustness and expands the reachable science workspace in deformable planetary environments.

*Haotian He,Ning Guo,Siqi Shi,Qipeng Liu,Wenzhao Lian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLASH is a data-efficient framework that creates a high-fidelity hybrid simulator by learning a surrogate collision model from minimal real-world data to bridge the sim-to-real gap in contact-rich robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sim-to-real gap, especially in modeling contact-rich dynamics like collisions, prevents direct transfer of robot policies trained in simulation. Conventional physics engines sacrifice accuracy for speed, causing discrepancies that hinder real-world deployment.

Method: CLASH first distills a base model from an imperfect simulator (MuJoCo) to capture general physical priors, then fine-tunes it with minimal real-world interactions (as few as 10 samples) to correct simulator inaccuracies, creating a hybrid simulator with learned surrogate collision model.

Result: The hybrid simulator achieves higher predictive accuracy while reducing collision computation time by nearly 50%. Policies trained with this simulator transfer more robustly to real world, doubling success rate in sequential pushing tasks with RL and significantly improving task performance with model-based control.

Conclusion: CLASH provides a data-efficient solution to the sim-to-real gap by creating hybrid simulators that combine simulator priors with minimal real-world data, enabling more robust policy transfer for contact-rich robotic tasks.

Abstract: The sim-to-real gap, particularly in the inaccurate modeling of contact-rich dynamics like collisions, remains a primary obstacle to deploying robot policies trained in simulation. Conventional physics engines often trade accuracy for computational speed, leading to discrepancies that prevent direct policy transfer. To address this, we introduce Collision Learning via Augmented Sim-to-real Hybridization (CLASH), a data-efficient framework that creates a high-fidelity hybrid simulator by learning a surrogate collision model from a minimal set of real-world data. In CLASH, a base model is first distilled from an imperfect simulator (MuJoCo) to capture general physical priors; this model is then fine-tuned with a remarkably small number of real-world interactions (as few as 10 samples) to correct for the simulator's inherent inaccuracies. The resulting hybrid simulator not only achieves higher predictive accuracy but also reduces collision computation time by nearly 50\%. We demonstrate that policies obtained with our hybrid simulator transfer more robustly to the real world, doubling the success rate in sequential pushing tasks with reinforecement learning and significantly increase the task performance with model-based control.

### [327] [Temporal Action Representation Learning for Tactical Resource Control and Subsequent Maneuver Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18716)
*Hoseong Jung,Sungil Son,Daesol Cho,Jonghae Park,Changhyun Choi,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TART is a Temporal Action Representation learning framework that uses contrastive learning to capture dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers, enabling multi-modal tactical decision-making in autonomous systems with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems need to reason about resource control and its impact on subsequent maneuvers, especially with limited energy budgets or restricted sensing. Prior hybrid action space approaches fail to capture causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers, and overlook the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions in fast-evolving scenarios.

Method: TART uses contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective to capture temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. Learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal, temporally coherent behaviors.

Result: TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines in two domains: (1) maze navigation with limited discrete actions for enhanced mobility, and (2) high-fidelity air combat simulation where an F-16 coordinates weapons/defensive systems with flight maneuvers.

Conclusion: TART effectively leverages limited resources and produces context-aware subsequent maneuvers by capturing temporal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers, enabling multi-modal tactical decision-making in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems should reason about resource control and its impact on subsequent maneuvers, especially when operating with limited energy budgets or restricted sensing. Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboCurate: A framework that improves synthetic robot data quality by using simulation replay to validate and filter generated actions, combined with appearance augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data from video generative models suffers from inconsistent action quality, and existing vision-language models can't properly evaluate physical accuracy or action quality in generated videos.

Method: Replays predicted actions in simulator and measures motion consistency between simulator rollout and generated video; uses image-to-image editing for observation diversity and action-preserving video-to-video transfer for appearance augmentation.

Result: Substantial improvements: +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop, +16.1% on DexMimicGen in pre-training, and +179.9% on challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: RoboCurate effectively addresses synthetic data quality issues by using simulation-based validation, enabling more reliable robot learning from generated data.

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by video generative models has shown promise for robot learning as a scalable pipeline, but it often suffers from inconsistent action quality due to imperfectly generated videos. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have been leveraged to validate video quality, but they have limitations in distinguishing physically accurate videos and, even then, cannot directly evaluate the generated actions themselves. To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting.

TL;DR: LoTIS is a robot-agnostic visual navigation model that localizes reference RGB trajectories in the robot's current view without requiring camera calibration, poses, or robot-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual navigation methods are often robot-specific, requiring camera calibration, poses, or robot-specific training. There's a need for a more flexible approach that can work across diverse robot embodiments without these constraints.

Method: Instead of predicting robot-specific actions, LoTIS predicts image-space coordinates of reference trajectory points as they appear in the robot's current view. It decouples perception from action and uses cross-trajectory training for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation (94-98% success). Achieves over 5x improvements on challenging tasks like backward traversal where baselines fail.

Conclusion: LoTIS provides effective robot-agnostic visual guidance that works zero-shot across diverse embodiments, is easy to use (even phone videos can enable navigation), and integrates well with local planning systems.

Abstract: We present LoTIS, a model for visual navigation that provides robot-agnostic image-space guidance by localizing a reference RGB trajectory in the robot's current view, without requiring camera calibration, poses, or robot-specific training. Instead of predicting actions tied to specific robots, we predict the image-space coordinates of the reference trajectory as they would appear in the robot's current view. This creates robot-agnostic visual guidance that easily integrates with local planning. Consequently, our model's predictions provide guidance zero-shot across diverse embodiments. By decoupling perception from action and learning to localize trajectory points rather than imitate behavioral priors, we enable a cross-trajectory training strategy for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes. We outperform state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation, achieving 94-98% success rate across diverse sim and real environments. Furthermore, we achieve over 5x improvements on challenging tasks where baselines fail, such as backward traversal. The system is straightforward to use: we show how even a video from a phone camera directly enables different robots to navigate to any point on the trajectory. Videos, demo, and code are available at https://finnbusch.com/lotis.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Habilis-β is a fast-motion, long-lasting on-device VLA model for real-world deployment, evaluated using new Productivity-Reliability Plane metrics (TPH and MTBI) instead of traditional single-trial success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA evaluation focuses on single-trial success rates under curated resets, which fails to capture the fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities needed for practical real-world operation where robots must work continuously without frequent interventions.

Method: Integrates language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations to handle state drift. Uses ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping, rectified-flow distillation for high-frequency edge control, and classifier-free guidance as a deployment-time knob to balance instruction adherence and learned priors.

Result: In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations: Simulation - 572.6 TPH and 39.2s MTBI (vs. 120.5 TPH and 30.5s for π₀.₅); Real-world humanoid logistics - 124 TPH and 137.4s MTBI (vs. 19 TPH and 46.1s). Also achieves highest reported performance on RoboTwin 2.0 leaderboard.

Conclusion: Habilis-β demonstrates superior fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities for practical deployment through the new PRP evaluation framework, significantly outperforming baselines in both simulation and real-world continuous operation scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Habilis-$β$, a fast-motion and long-lasting on-device vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for real-world deployment. Current VLA evaluation remains largely confined to single-trial success rates under curated resets, which fails to capture the fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities essential for practical operation. To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, Habilis-$β$ achieves 572.6 TPH and 39.2 s MTBI (vs. 120.5 TPH and 30.5 s for $π_{0.5}$), while in a real-world humanoid logistics workflow it achieves 124 TPH and 137.4 s MTBI (vs. 19 TPH and 46.1 s for $π_{0.5}$). Finally, Habilis-$β$ achieves the highest reported performance on the standard RoboTwin 2.0 leaderboard across representative tasks, validating its effectiveness in complex manipulation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food waste management is crucial for sustainability, but inorganic contaminants hinder recycling. Robotic automation can accelerate sorting, but diverse/unpredictable contaminants create grasping challenges. Existing benchmarks are limited to simulation, use simple metrics, and overlook important pre-grasp conditions.

Method: Developed GRAB framework integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision systems, and pre-grasp conditions. Conducted systematic comparison of industrial grasping modalities through 1,750 grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes with critical graspability metrics.

Result: Object quality emerged as dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels played moderate roles. Distinct gripper strengths and limitations were revealed through large-scale evaluation.

Conclusion: Highlights essential design considerations and reinforces need for multimodal gripper technologies capable of robust cross-category performance for effective robotic food waste sorting.

Abstract: Food waste management is critical for sustainability, yet inorganic contaminants hinder recycling potential. Robotic automation presents a compelling approach to this challenge by accelerating the sorting process through automated contaminant removal. Still, the diverse and unpredictable nature of contaminants creates major challenges for robotic grasping. Benchmarking frameworks are critical for evaluating challenges from various perspectives. However, existing protocols rely on limited simulation datasets, prioritise simple metrics such as success rate, and overlook key object and environment-related pre-grasp conditions. This paper introduces GRAB, a comprehensive Grasping Real-World Article Benchmarking framework that addresses this gap by integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision, and, importantly, pre-grasp conditions, establishing a set of critical graspability metrics. It systematically compares industrial grasping modalities through an in-depth experimental evaluation involving 1,750 food contaminant grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes. This large-scale evaluation provides an extensive assessment of grasp performance for food waste sorting, offering a level of depth that has rarely been explored in previous studies. The results reveal distinct gripper strengths and limitations, with object quality emerging as the dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels play moderate roles.

*J. E. Domínguez-Vidal,Alberto Sanfeliu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares intention prediction vs explicit communication systems for human-robot collaborative object transportation, finding humans prefer natural systems despite higher failure rates, with optimal results from combining both approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intention prediction systems have uncertainty due to human behavior randomness, leading researchers to explore explicit communication methods. The paper aims to compare these approaches in a human-robot collaborative task.

Method: Four systems were tested: two intention predictors (force-based and enhanced velocity prediction) and two explicit communication methods (button interface and voice commands). These were integrated into IVO mobile social robot with force sensors and LiDAR. 75 volunteers performed 255 executions in three groups testing inference systems, communication systems, and combined strategies in a 5-7 meter obstacle navigation task.

Result: 1) Once sufficient performance is achieved, humans no longer notice technical improvements but still assess them positively. 2) Humans prefer more natural systems even with higher failure rates. 3) The preferred option is the right combination of both prediction and communication systems.

Conclusion: For human-robot collaboration, the optimal approach combines both intention prediction and explicit communication systems, with human preference leaning toward natural interfaces despite technical trade-offs.

Abstract: Although in the literature it is common to find predictors and inference systems that try to predict human intentions, the uncertainty of these models due to the randomness of human behavior has led some authors to start advocating the use of communication systems that explicitly elicit human intention. In this work, it is analyzed the use of four different communication systems with a human-robot collaborative object transportation task as experimental testbed: two intention predictors (one based on force prediction and another with an enhanced velocity prediction algorithm) and two explicit communication methods (a button interface and a voice-command recognition system). These systems were integrated into IVO, a custom mobile social robot equipped with force sensor to detect the force exchange between both agents and LiDAR to detect the environment. The collaborative task required transporting an object over a 5-7 meter distance with obstacles in the middle, demanding rapid decisions and precise physical coordination. 75 volunteers perform a total of 255 executions divided into three groups, testing inference systems in the first round, communication systems in the second, and the combined strategies in the third. The results show that, 1) once sufficient performance is achieved, the human no longer notices and positively assesses technical improvements; 2) the human prefers systems that are more natural to them even though they have higher failure rates; and 3) the preferred option is the right combination of both systems.

### [334] [Gait Asymmetry from Unilateral Weakness and Improvement With Ankle Assistance: a Reinforcement Learning based Simulation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18862)
*Yifei Yuan,Ghaith Androwis,Xianlian Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-based musculoskeletal simulation shows unilateral muscle weakness causes progressive gait asymmetry, and ankle exoskeleton assistance can partially restore symmetry metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simulation-based workflow for early controller development before patient experiments, quantifying how unilateral muscle weakness affects gait symmetry and evaluating whether ankle exoskeleton assistance can improve symmetry under impaired conditions.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based musculoskeletal simulation framework that induces asymmetric gait by reducing right-leg muscle strength to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline, then quantifies asymmetry using toe-off timing, peak contact forces, and joint-level symmetry metrics.

Result: Increasing weakness produced progressively larger temporal and kinematic asymmetry, most pronounced at ankle. At 50% strength, ankle exoskeleton assistance improved kinematic symmetry - reducing ankle symmetry index from 25.8% to 18.5% and increasing correlation from r=0.948 to 0.966, though peak loading remained biased toward unimpaired side.

Conclusion: The framework supports controlled evaluation of impairment severity and assistive strategies, providing a basis for future validation in human experiments and early controller development for rehabilitation devices.

Abstract: Unilateral muscle weakness often leads to asymmetric gait, disrupting interlimb coordination and stance timing. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based musculoskeletal simulation framework to (1) quantify how progressive unilateral muscle weakness affects gait symmetry and (2) evaluate whether ankle exoskeleton assistance can improve gait symmetry under impaired conditions. The overarching goal is to establish a simulation- and learning-based workflow that supports early controller development prior to patient experiments. Asymmetric gait was induced by reducing right-leg muscle strength to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline. Gait asymmetry was quantified using toe-off timing, peak contact forces, and joint-level symmetry metrics. Increasing weakness produced progressively larger temporal and kinematic asymmetry, most pronounced at the ankle. Ankle range of motion symmetry degraded from near-symmetric behavior at 100% strength (symmetry index, SI = +6.4%; correlation r=0.974) to severe asymmetry at 25% strength (SI = -47.1%, r=0.889), accompanied by a load shift toward the unimpaired limb. At 50% strength, ankle exoskeleton assistance improved kinematic symmetry relative to the unassisted impaired condition, reducing the magnitude of ankle SI from 25.8% to 18.5% and increasing ankle correlation from r=0.948 to 0.966, although peak loading remained biased toward the unimpaired side. Overall, this framework supports controlled evaluation of impairment severity and assistive strategies, and provides a basis for future validation in human experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A pignistic-transform-based method enables fair comparison of Bayesian log-odds vs Dempster's rule in occupancy grid mapping by matching per-observation decision probabilities, showing Bayesian fusion is favored under BetP matching but not under normalized plausibility matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fair comparison between Bayesian log-odds and Dempster's combination rule in occupancy grid mapping by isolating the fusion rule from sensor parameterization effects, which has been a challenge in previous comparisons.

Method: Uses a pignistic-transform-based methodology that matches per-observation decision probabilities, allowing comparison of fusion rules independent of sensor parameterization. Applied across simulation, two real lidar datasets, and downstream path planning tasks.

Result: Under BetP matching, Bayesian fusion is consistently favored (15/15 directional consistency, p = 3.1e-5) with small absolute differences (0.001-0.022). Under normalized plausibility matching, the direction reverses, showing the result is matching-criterion-specific.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a reusable framework for fair Bayesian/belief function comparisons, demonstrating that fusion rule performance depends on the matching criterion used, with Bayesian fusion preferred under BetP matching but not under normalized plausibility matching.

Abstract: We introduce a pignistic-transform-based methodology for fair comparison of Bayesian log-odds and Dempster's combination rule in occupancy grid mapping, matching per-observation decision probabilities to isolate the fusion rule from sensor parameterization. Under BetP matching across simulation, two real lidar datasets, and downstream path planning, Bayesian fusion is consistently favored (15/15 directional consistency, p = 3.1e-5) with small absolute differences (0.001-0.022). Under normalized plausibility matching, the direction reverses, confirming the result is matching-criterion-specific. The methodology is reusable for any future Bayesian/belief function comparison.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A frontier-based exploration algorithm for robots to satisfy temporal logic specifications in unknown environments using commit states to track irreversible actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to satisfy temporal logic specifications (scLTL) in unknown environments where label locations are not known beforehand, requiring exploration while preserving all possible ways to complete the task.

Method: Introduces commit states in automata to capture irreversible actions, then proposes a sound and complete frontier-based exploration algorithm that strategically guides robot exploration while preserving all possible satisfaction paths.

Result: The proposed method is validated through simulations, showing efficacy in enabling robots to satisfy scLTL specifications in unknown environments.

Conclusion: Commit states enable effective exploration for temporal logic planning in unknown environments by tracking irreversible actions and preserving all possible satisfaction paths.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of temporal logic motion planning for an autonomous robot operating in an unknown environment. The objective is to enable the robot to satisfy a syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (scLTL) specification when the exact locations of the desired labels are not known a priori. We introduce a new type of automaton state, referred to as commit states. These states capture intermediate task progress resulting from actions whose consequences are irreversible. In other words, certain future paths to satisfaction become not feasible after taking those actions that lead to the commit states. By leveraging commit states, we propose a sound and complete frontier-based exploration algorithm that strategically guides the robot to make progress toward the task while preserving all possible ways of satisfying it. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through simulations.

TL;DR: TactEx is an explainable multimodal framework combining vision, touch, and language for human-like hardness estimation, evaluated on fruit ripeness assessment with 90% task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate perception of object hardness is essential for safe and dexterous contact-rich robotic manipulation, requiring both tactile sensing and contextual understanding.

Method: Fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts using ResNet50+LSTM for hardness estimation, cross-modal alignment module, and lightweight LLM for instruction parsing and explanations. Compares YOLO with Grounded-SAM for touch placement.

Result: Achieves statistically significant class separation for fruit ripeness (p < 0.01), GSAM outperforms YOLO for fine-grained segmentation, attains 90% task success on simple queries, and generalizes to novel tasks without large-scale tuning.

Conclusion: Combining pretrained visual and tactile models with language grounding advances explainable, human-like touch perception and decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: Accurate perception of object hardness is essential for safe and dexterous contact-rich robotic manipulation. Here, we present TactEx, an explainable multimodal robotic interaction framework that unifies vision, touch, and language for human-like hardness estimation and interactive guidance. We evaluate TactEx on fruit-ripeness assessment, a representative task that requires both tactile sensing and contextual understanding. The system fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts. A ResNet50+LSTM model estimates hardness from sequential tactile data, while a cross-modal alignment module combines visual cues with guidance from a large language model (LLM). This explainable multimodal interface allows users to distinguish ripeness levels with statistically significant class separation (p < 0.01 for all fruit pairs). For touch placement, we compare YOLO with Grounded-SAM (GSAM) and find GSAM to be more robust for fine-grained segmentation and contact-site selection. A lightweight LLM parses user instructions and produces grounded natural-language explanations linked to the tactile outputs. In end-to-end evaluations, TactEx attains 90% task success on simple user queries and generalises to novel tasks without large-scale tuning. These results highlight the promise of combining pretrained visual and tactile models with language grounding to advance explainable, human-like touch perception and decision-making in robotics.

*Pongporn Supa,Alex Dunnett,Feng Xiao,Rui Wu,Mirko Kovac,Basaran Bahadir Kocer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A drone with elastic horns enables touch-and-go maneuvers for proximity navigation without active obstacle avoidance, using passive dynamics for stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial robots need to handle uncertain contact forces during physical interactions with unknown targets, which typically requires accurate sensing and active control. Current approaches struggle with contact force uncertainty.

Method: Developed a drone platform with elastic horns that enables self-regulated touch-and-go maneuvers. The system leverages environmental interaction as embodied control, where stabilization emerges from passive dynamic responses resembling a mass-spring-damper system.

Result: Elastic horns absorb impact energy while maintaining vehicle stability, reducing pitch oscillations by 38% compared to rigid horns. Lower horn arrangement reduced pitch oscillations by ~54%. Platform also demonstrates stable sustained contact with static objects using standard attitude PID controller.

Conclusion: Elastic horns enable effective touch-and-go maneuvers for aerial physical interaction, providing passive stabilization and reducing reliance on active control systems for near-obstacle navigation.

Abstract: Aerial robots are evolving from avoiding obstacles to exploiting the environmental contact interactions for navigation, exploration and manipulation. A key challenge in such aerial physical interactions lies in handling uncertain contact forces on unknown targets, which typically demand accurate sensing and active control. We present a drone platform with elastic horns that enables touch-and-go manoeuvres - a self-regulated, consecutive bumping motion that allows the drone to maintain proximity to a wall without relying on active obstacle avoidance. It leverages environmental interaction as a form of embodied control, where low-level stabilisation and near-obstacle navigation emerge from the passive dynamic responses of the drone-obstacle system that resembles a mass-spring-damper system. Experiments show that the elastic horn can absorb impact energy while maintaining vehicle stability, reducing pitch oscillations by 38% compared to the rigid horn configuration. The lower horn arrangement was found to reduce pitch oscillations by approximately 54%. In addition to intermittent contact, the platform equipped with elastic horns also demonstrates stable, sustained contact with static objects, relying on a standard attitude PID controller.

TL;DR: Proposes a predictive artificial potential field method with time information and predictive potential for smoother, more efficient path planning for high-speed unmanned surface vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed unmanned surface vehicles need more complex path planning solutions to reduce sailing time and save energy. Traditional artificial potential field methods have limitations in global and local path planning, particularly with concave local minimum problems and reachability issues.

Method: Introduces a predictive artificial potential field that incorporates time information and predictive potential. Three key modifications: angle limit, velocity adjustment, and predictive potential to enhance path feasibility and flatness. Considers vehicle dynamics and local minimum reachability.

Result: The predictive method successfully restricts maximum turning angle, shortens sailing time, and intelligently avoids obstacles. It addresses concave local minimum problems and improves reachability in special scenarios compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The predictive artificial potential field generates more efficient paths that reduce sailing time and conserve energy for unmanned surface vehicles, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Path planning for high-speed unmanned surface vehicles requires more complex solutions to reduce sailing time and save energy. This article proposes a new predictive artificial potential field that incorporates time information and predictive potential to plan smoother paths. It explores the principles of the artificial potential field, considering vehicle dynamics and local minimum reachability. The study first analyzes the most advanced traditional artificial potential field and its drawbacks in global and local path planning. It then introduces three modifications to the predictive artificial potential field-angle limit, velocity adjustment, and predictive potential to enhance the feasibility and flatness of the generated path. A comparison between the traditional and predictive artificial potential fields demonstrates that the latter successfully restricts the maximum turning angle, shortens sailing time, and intelligently avoids obstacles. Simulation results further verify that the predictive artificial potential field addresses the concave local minimum problem and improves reachability in special scenarios, ultimately generating a more efficient path that reduces sailing time and conserves energy for unmanned surface vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-world study of robotaxi experiences reveals users value cost, consistency, and agency but face challenges with flexibility, transparency, and safety. Proposes user-driven design framework for end-to-end journey.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research has focused on technical driving performance of robotaxis but neglected how passengers actually experience and evaluate rides without human drivers. Prior work often uses simulated or hypothetical settings rather than real-world experiences.

Method: Used 18 semi-structured interviews and autoethnographic ride experiences to investigate real-world robotaxi use, moving beyond simulated or hypothetical settings.

Result: Users were attracted by low cost, social recommendations, and curiosity. They valued increased agency, consistent driving behavior, and standardized experiences. Challenges included limited flexibility, insufficient transparency, management difficulty, robustness concerns, and emergency handling. Experiences were shaped by privacy, safety, ethics, and trust issues.

Conclusion: Proposes a user-driven design framework spanning the end-to-end journey: pre-ride configuration (hailing), context-aware pickup facilitation (pick-up), in-ride explainability (traveling), and accountable post-ride feedback (drop-off) to guide robotaxi interaction and service design.

Abstract: Robotaxis are emerging as a promising form of urban mobility, yet research has largely emphasized technical driving performance while leaving open how passengers experience and evaluate rides without a human driver. To address the limitations of prior work that often relies on simulated or hypothetical settings, we investigate real-world robotaxi use through 18 semi-structured interviews and autoethnographic ride experiences. We found that users were drawn to robotaxis by low cost, social recommendation, and curiosity. They valued a distinctive set of benefits, such as an increased sense of agency, and consistent driving behavioral consistency and standardized ride experiences. However, they encountered persistent challenges around limited flexibility, insufficient transparency, management difficulty, robustness concerns in edge cases, and emergency handling concerns. Robotaxi experiences were shaped by privacy, safety, ethics, and trust. Users were often privacy-indifferent yet sensitive to opaque access and leakage risks; safety perceptions were polarized; and ethical considerations surfaced round issues such as accountability, feedback responsibility and absence of human-like social norms. Based on these findings, we propose a user-driven design framework spanning the end-to-end journey, such as pre-ride configuration (hailing), context-aware pickup facilitation (pick-up) in-ride explainability (traveling), and accountable post-ride feedback (drop-off) to guide robotaxi interaction and service design.

TL;DR: Mobile robots use thermal radiation fields to navigate safely through fire-affected environments by detecting fires and calculating thermal radiation to avoid hazardous areas while reaching goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous mobile robots need to safely navigate fire-affected environments for disaster response applications like search-and-rescue, firefighting, and hazardous material response, requiring understanding of fire hazards.

Method: Register depth and thermal images to create 3D point clouds with temperature data, identify fires, use Stefan-Boltzmann law to approximate thermal radiation in empty spaces, build continuous thermal radiation fields, and embed thermal constraints into cost maps for path planning.

Result: Validated on Boston Dynamics Spot robot in controlled experiments, demonstrating ability to avoid hazardous regions while reaching navigation goals.

Conclusion: The approach enables autonomous deployment of mobile robots in fire-affected environments, paving the way for safer disaster response operations.

Abstract: Safely moving through environments affected by fire is a critical capability for autonomous mobile robots deployed in disaster response. In this work, we present a novel approach for mobile robots to understand fire through building real-time thermal radiation fields. We register depth and thermal images to obtain a 3D point cloud annotated with temperature values. From these data, we identify fires and use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to approximate the thermal radiation in empty spaces. This enables the construction of a continuous thermal radiation field over the environment. We show that this representation can be used for robot navigation, where we embed thermal constraints into the cost map to compute collision-free and thermally safe paths. We validate our approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in controlled experimental settings. Our experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to avoid hazardous regions while still reaching navigation goals. Our approach paves the way toward mobile robots that can be autonomously deployed in fire-affected environments, with potential applications in search-and-rescue, firefighting, and hazardous material response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) suffers from cumulative drift without global references, while UWB ranging provides global observations but existing methods are limited to single-robot scenarios and require pre-calibrated anchors, reducing practical robustness.

Method: Proposes a distributed collaborative framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are included in system state to handle calibration uncertainty, and shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication for additional geometric constraints. Uses right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups to preserve VIO observability properties.

Result: Simulation results with multiple robots show DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness while enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.

Conclusion: DC-VIRO provides an effective distributed solution for multi-robot localization in GPS-denied environments by combining VIO and UWB measurements with anchor self-calibration, overcoming limitations of existing single-robot approaches.

Abstract: Reliable localization is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian inference on smooth manifolds is fundamental to robotics, but exact operations like marginalization and conditioning become non-Gaussian and geometry-dependent, requiring stability analysis of common linearization approaches.

Method: The authors study tangent-linearized Gaussian inference, deriving non-asymptotic W₂ (Wasserstein-2) stability bounds for projection marginalization and surface-measure conditioning. The bounds separate local geometric distortion from nonlocal tail leakage, and for Gaussian inputs yield closed-form diagnostics from mean, covariance, and curvature/reach surrogates.

Result: Circle and planar-pushing experiments validate a predicted calibration transition near √‖Σ‖ₒₚ/R ≈ 1/6, indicating that normal-direction uncertainty is the dominant failure mode when locality breaks. The diagnostics provide practical triggers for switching inference methods.

Conclusion: The derived stability bounds and diagnostics offer practical guidance for when to switch from single-chart linearization to multi-chart or sample-based manifold inference in robotics applications, with normal-direction uncertainty identified as the key failure mode.

Abstract: Gaussian inference on smooth manifolds is central to robotics, but exact marginalization and conditioning are generally non-Gaussian and geometry-dependent. We study tangent-linearized Gaussian inference and derive explicit non-asymptotic $W_2$ stability bounds for projection marginalization and surface-measure conditioning. The bounds separate local second-order geometric distortion from nonlocal tail leakage and, for Gaussian inputs, yield closed-form diagnostics from $(μ,Σ)$ and curvature/reach surrogates. Circle and planar-pushing experiments validate the predicted calibration transition near $\sqrt{\|Σ\|_{\mathrm{op}}}/R\approx 1/6$ and indicate that normal-direction uncertainty is the dominant failure mode when locality breaks. These diagnostics provide practical triggers for switching from single-chart linearization to multi-chart or sample-based manifold inference.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular "Human-to-Robot" imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to learn manipulation skills from unstructured video demonstrations by decoupling video understanding from robot execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based LfD approaches face two key challenges: (1) general video captioning models prioritize global scene features over task-relevant objects, producing descriptions unsuitable for robotic execution, and (2) end-to-end architectures require extensive paired datasets and struggle with generalization across objects and scenarios.

Method: A modular framework with two decoupled stages: (1) Video Understanding using Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation using TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations.

Result: Video understanding achieves 89.97% action classification accuracy and BLEU-4 scores of 0.351 on standard objects and 0.265 on novel objects (76.4% and 128.4% improvements over baselines). Robot manipulation achieves 87.5% average success rate across all actions, with 100% success on reaching tasks and up to 90% on complex pick-and-place operations.

Conclusion: The proposed modular pipeline successfully enables robots to learn manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, addressing limitations of existing approaches by decoupling video understanding from policy learning and achieving strong performance in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) offers a promising paradigm for robot skill acquisition. Recent approaches attempt to extract manipulation commands directly from video demonstrations, yet face two critical challenges: (1) general video captioning models prioritize global scene features over task-relevant objects, producing descriptions unsuitable for precise robotic execution, and (2) end-to-end architectures coupling visual understanding with policy learning require extensive paired datasets and struggle to generalize across objects and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations. We validated our approach in PyBullet simulation environments with a UR5e manipulator and in a real-world experiment with a UF850 manipulator across four fundamental actions: reach, pick, move, and put. For video understanding, our method achieves 89.97% action classification accuracy and BLEU-4 scores of 0.351 on standard objects and 0.265 on novel objects, representing improvements of 76.4% and 128.4% over the best baseline, respectively. For robot manipulation, our framework achieves an average success rate of 87.5% across all actions, with 100% success on reaching tasks and up to 90% on complex pick-and-place operations.

*Hieu Bui,Ziyan Gao,Yuya Hosoda,Joo-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified pushing policy using visual prompts and flow matching for reactive, multimodal manipulation that outperforms existing baselines and integrates with VLM-guided planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pushing approaches rely on multi-step plans with limited primitives, restricting efficiency and versatility across different scenarios. There's a need for a more flexible, unified approach.

Method: Incorporates a lightweight prompting mechanism into a flow matching policy to guide generation of reactive, multimodal pushing actions. Visual prompts can be specified by high-level planners for reuse across planning problems.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines and effectively serves as a low-level primitive within a VLM-guided planning framework to solve table-cleaning tasks efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed unified pushing policy with visual prompting enables versatile, efficient manipulation across different scenarios and integrates well with high-level planning frameworks.

Abstract: As one of the simplest non-prehensile manipulation skills, pushing has been widely studied as an effective means to rearrange objects. Existing approaches, however, typically rely on multi-step push plans composed of pre-defined pushing primitives with limited application scopes, which restrict their efficiency and versatility across different scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified pushing policy that incorporates a lightweight prompting mechanism into a flow matching policy to guide the generation of reactive, multimodal pushing actions. The visual prompt can be specified by a high-level planner, enabling the reuse of the pushing policy across a wide range of planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified pushing policy not only outperforms existing baselines but also effectively serves as a low-level primitive within a VLM-guided planning framework to solve table-cleaning tasks efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness and efficiency of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models versus neuro-symbolic architectures for structured, long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model and a neuro-symbolic architecture combining PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control, evaluated on structured Towers of Hanoi variants in simulation.

Result: Neuro-symbolic model achieved 95% success on 3-block task vs 34% for VLA, generalized to 4-block variant (78% success) while VLAs failed, and consumed nearly two orders of magnitude less energy during training.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic approaches with explicit symbolic structure offer better reliability, generalization, data efficiency, and energy efficiency compared to end-to-end foundation models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently been proposed as a pathway toward generalist robotic policies capable of interpreting natural language and visual inputs to generate manipulation actions. However, their effectiveness and efficiency on structured, long-horizon manipulation tasks remain unclear. In this work, we present a head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model π0 and a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control. We evaluate both approaches on structured variants of the Towers of Hanoi manipulation task in simulation while measuring both task performance and energy consumption during training and execution. On the 3-block task, the neuro-symbolic model achieves 95% success compared to 34% for the best-performing VLA. The neuro-symbolic model also generalizes to an unseen 4-block variant (78% success), whereas both VLAs fail to complete the task. During training, VLA fine-tuning consumes nearly two orders of magnitude more energy than the neuro-symbolic approach. These results highlight important trade-offs between end-to-end foundation-model approaches and structured reasoning architectures for long-horizon robotic manipulation, emphasizing the role of explicit symbolic structure in improving reliability, data efficiency, and energy efficiency.

*Abhinav Gandhi,Shou-Shan Chiang,Cagdas D. Onal,Berk Calli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-based whole body shape control for soft continuum manipulators using 2.5D visual servoing without proprioceptive sensors


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based control only regulates end effector pose, not whole body shape, and requires proprioceptive sensors or images at reference poses. Soft continuum manipulators often lack proprioceptive capabilities.

Method: Model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing using external camera to observe whole body shape. Inverse kinematics solver generates reference features without needing images at reference pose. No proprioceptive sensors required.

Result: Controller achieves globally stable asymptotic convergence (vs local minima in literature). Regulates whole body shape while positioning end effector with <1mm steady-state error. Successful object manipulation tasks: stacking, pouring, pulling.

Conclusion: Proposed vision-based control enables whole body shape regulation for soft continuum manipulators without proprioceptive sensors, leveraging kinematic redundancy for improved manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based control algorithm for regulating the whole body shape of extensible multisection soft continuum manipulators. Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm. Proof-of-concept object manipulation experiments including stacking, pouring, and pulling tasks are performed to demonstrate our controller's applicability.

TL;DR: CaPE is a safe, interpretable multimodal path planning method that uses vision-language models to generate path editing programs from communication, verified by model-based planners for multi-agent cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized agents need to quickly adapt plans to others' behaviors, especially when intentions are unpredictable. Language communication becomes crucial for safety in such scenarios, particularly for path-level cooperation like collision avoidance and physical collaboration.

Method: CaPE uses a vision-language model to synthesize path editing programs based on environment perception and language communication from other agents. These programs are then verified by a model-based planner to ensure safety and interpretability, grounding communication to actual path plan updates.

Result: CaPE works as a plug-and-play module across different robotic systems, enhancing robots' ability to align plans to language communication from other robots or humans. It enables open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability in diverse scenarios including autonomous driving, household tasks, and joint carrying.

Conclusion: The combination of VLM-based path editing program synthesis with model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve flexible, open-ended cooperation while ensuring safety and interpretability, making language communication effectively actionable for path-level coordination.

Abstract: Successful cooperation among decentralized agents requires each agent to quickly adapt its plan to the behavior of other agents. In scenarios where agents cannot confidently predict one another's intentions and plans, language communication can be crucial for ensuring safety. In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans. We also show that the combination of the VLM-based path editing program synthesis and model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WildOS is a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning using foundation models, enabling robust navigation in unstructured outdoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation in complex, unstructured outdoor environments requires operating over long ranges without prior maps and limited depth sensing. Relying solely on geometric frontiers is insufficient, and semantic reasoning about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration.

Method: WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph for spatial memory and uses ExploRFM, a foundation-model-based vision module, to score frontier nodes. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space. A particle-filter-based method provides coarse localization of open-vocabulary target queries to estimate candidate goal positions beyond the robot's depth horizon.

Result: Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy.

Conclusion: WildOS highlights the potential of vision foundation models to drive open-world robotic behaviors that are both semantically informed and geometrically grounded, enabling effective long-range object search in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex, unstructured outdoor environments requires robots to operate over long ranges without prior maps and limited depth sensing. In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy. Our results highlight the potential of vision foundation models to drive open-world robotic behaviors that are both semantically informed and geometrically grounded.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TOPReward is a novel temporal value function that extracts task progress from pretrained video VLMs' internal token logits, achieving superior zero-shot generalization across 130+ real-world robotic tasks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have poor sample efficiency and sparse rewards in RL for real-world robotics. Existing temporal value functions fail to generalize beyond training domains, creating a need for generalizable process reward models that provide fine-grained feedback.

Method: TOPReward leverages pretrained video VLMs' latent world knowledge to estimate robotic task progress. Instead of prompting VLMs to directly output progress values (which causes numerical misrepresentation), it extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits using a probabilistically grounded approach.

Result: In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model.

Conclusion: TOPReward provides a versatile tool for downstream applications including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning, addressing the generalization limitations of existing temporal value functions for robotic RL.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-based planning approach using Monte Carlo Tree Search with physics-informed simulation is practical and effective for autonomous underwater glider navigation, enabling successful long-term marine deployments.

Abstract: Underwater glider robots have become an indispensable tool for ocean sampling. Although stakeholders are calling for tools to manage increasingly large fleets of gliders, successful autonomous long-term deployments have thus far been scarce, which hints at a lack of suitable methodologies and systems. In this work, we formulate glider navigation planning as a stochastic shortest-path Markov Decision Process and propose a sample-based online planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. Samples are generated by a physics-informed simulator that captures uncertain execution of controls and ocean current forecasts while remaining computationally tractable. The simulator parameters are fitted using historical glider data. We integrate these methods into an autonomous command-and-control system for Slocum gliders that enables closed-loop replanning at each surfacing. The resulting system was validated in two field deployments in the North Sea totalling approximately 3 months and 1000 km of autonomous operation. Results demonstrate improved efficiency compared to straight-to-goal navigation and show the practicality of sample-based planning for long-term marine autonomy.

TL;DR: A modular magnetic millirobot platform with three specialized cube-shaped modules achieves self-assembly, reconfiguration, and locomotion using programmable 2D magnetic fields, enabling robust control and multimodal behavior for confined environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing modular magnetic robots have limitations: they rely on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, use bulky 3D electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which restricts their biomedical applications.

Method: Three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets: free module (self-assembly/reconfiguration), fixed module (flip-and-walk locomotion), and gripper module (cargo manipulation). Actuation via programmable combinations of time-varying 2D uniform and gradient magnetic fields. Closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning.

Result: Achieved robust single-module control, self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, showing geometry's role in reconfiguration reliability.

Conclusion: The platform demonstrates versatile modular robotics with multimodal behavior and robust control, offering a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments.

Abstract: Modular small-scale robots offer the potential for on-demand assembly and disassembly, enabling task-specific adaptation in dynamic and constrained environments. However, existing modular magnetic platforms often depend on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, employ bulky three-dimensional electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which limits their applicability in biomedical settings. In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, underscoring the role of module geometry in reconfiguration reliability. These results establish a versatile modular robotic platform capable of multimodal behavior and robust control, suggesting a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments.

TL;DR: Vid2Sid: A video-driven system identification pipeline that uses foundation-model perception and VLM-in-the-loop optimization to calibrate robot simulator physics parameters with natural language rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot simulator calibration methods (manual tuning or black-box optimizers) lack interpretability and struggle with limited sensing (external cameras only), perception noise, and absence of direct force/state measurements.

Method: Couples foundation-model perception with VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired simulation-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales.

Result: Achieves best average rank across all settings on sim2real holdout controls, matches/exceeds black-box optimizers while providing interpretable reasoning. Sim2sim validation shows most accurate ground-truth parameter recovery (mean relative error under 13% vs. 28-98%).

Conclusion: VLM-guided optimization excels with clean perception and expressive simulators, while model-class limitations bound performance in challenging settings. Provides interpretable physics calibration from video data.

Abstract: Calibrating a robot simulator's physics parameters (friction, damping, material stiffness) to match real hardware is often done by hand or with black-box optimizers that reduce error but cannot explain which physical discrepancies drive the error. When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\% vs. 28--98\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings.

TL;DR: A novel test-time computation framework for robotic manipulation that decouples state evaluation from action generation, uses explicit advantage modeling with beam search, and includes confidence-based early exit, achieving 24.6% higher success rates and 56.5% faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VLM-based robotic manipulation approaches using reflective planning have limitations: they inefficiently learn state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only single greedy futures, and suffer from high inference latency.

Method: Proposes a test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. Explicitly models action plan advantage (goal distance reduction) using a scalable critic. Uses beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate expected returns. Includes confidence-based trigger for early exit when predictions are reliable.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks show 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines and 56.5% reduction in inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses key limitations of previous VLM-based approaches by providing more direct supervisory signals, robust multi-path evaluation, and efficient computation, significantly improving both performance and inference speed for complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Solving complex, long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks requires a deep understanding of physical interactions, reasoning about their long-term consequences, and precise high-level planning. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to anticipate and adapt to failures to collaborate effectively with humans in complex domains, but current AI planning systems and LLMs struggle with task uncertainty and outcome unpredictability.

Method: Integrates LLMs' generic prediction capabilities with Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language's probabilistic sequential decision-making. The robot reasons about tasks, human capabilities, predicts potential failures (due to human ability limitations or missing domain objects), and executes preventive or recovery actions.

Result: Experimental evaluation in VirtualHome 3D simulation environment shows substantial performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively addresses the challenge of failure anticipation and adaptation in human-robot collaboration by combining complementary strengths of LLMs and probabilistic planning.

Abstract: Anticipating and adapting to failures is a key capability robots need to collaborate effectively with humans in complex domains. This continues to be a challenge despite the impressive performance of state of the art AI planning systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) because of the uncertainty associated with the tasks and their outcomes. Toward addressing this challenge, we present a hybrid framework that integrates the generic prediction capabilities of an LLM with the probabilistic sequential decision-making capability of Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language. For any given task, the robot reasons about the task and the capabilities of the human attempting to complete it; predicts potential failures due to lack of ability (in the human) or lack of relevant domain objects; and executes actions to prevent such failures or recover from them. Experimental evaluation in the VirtualHome 3D simulation environment demonstrates substantial improvement in performance compared with state of the art baselines.

Conclusion: The decomposition of Bellman Value into a structured graph with specialized Bellman equations provides an effective framework for handling complex temporal logic tasks in high-dimensional spaces, enabling automatic balance of safety and goal specifications without laborious tuning.

Abstract: Real-world tasks involve nuanced combinations of goal and safety specifications. In high dimensions, the challenge is exacerbated: formal automata become cumbersome, and the combination of sparse rewards tends to require laborious tuning. In this work, we consider the innate structure of the Bellman Value as a means to naturally organize the problem for improved automatic performance. Namely, we prove the Bellman Value for a complex task defined in temporal logic can be decomposed into a graph of Bellman Values, connected by a set of well-known Bellman equations (BEs): the Reach-Avoid BE, the Avoid BE, and a novel type, the Reach-Avoid-Loop BE. To solve the Value and optimal policy, we propose VDPPO, which embeds the decomposed Value graph into a two-layer neural net, bootstrapping the implicit dependencies. We conduct a variety of simulated and hardware experiments to test our method on complex, high-dimensional tasks involving heterogeneous teams and nonlinear dynamics. Ultimately, we find this approach greatly improves performance over existing baselines, balancing safety and liveness automatically.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted UAVs represent promising direction for adaptive, context-aware aerial operations, with future research needed on ethical considerations and multimodal applications.

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely deployed across diverse applications due to their mobility and agility. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative opportunity to enhance UAV intelligence beyond conventional optimization-based and learning-based approaches. By integrating LLMs into UAV systems, advanced environmental understanding, swarm coordination, mobility optimization, and high-level task reasoning can be achieved, thereby allowing more adaptive and context-aware aerial operations. This survey systematically explores the intersection of LLMs and UAV technologies and proposes a unified framework that consolidates existing architectures, methodologies, and applications for UAVs. We first present a structured taxonomy of LLM adaptation techniques for UAVs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, along with key reasoning capabilities such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We then examine LLM-assisted UAV communications and operations, covering navigation, mission planning, swarm control, safety, autonomy, and network management. After that, the survey further discusses Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for human-swarm interaction, perception-driven navigation, and collaborative control. Finally, we address ethical considerations, including bias, transparency, accountability, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) strategies, and outline future research directions. Overall, this work positions LLM-assisted UAVs as a foundation for intelligent and adaptive aerial systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Diffusion models enable efficient lookahead action planning for active search without expensive tree search, outperforming RL baselines and being more computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active search requires balancing exploration-exploitation trade-offs, but existing lookahead algorithms rely on computationally expensive search trees. There's a need for more efficient approaches that can plan ahead without exhaustive tree building.

Method: Leverage diffusion models' sequence modeling abilities to sample lookahead action sequences for active search. Address optimism bias in prior diffusion-based RL approaches and propose solutions for cost-aware decision making with single and multi-agent teams.

Result: Proposed algorithm outperforms standard offline RL baselines in full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide an effective alternative to expensive tree search for lookahead planning in active search, enabling better exploration-exploitation balance with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Active search for recovering objects of interest through online, adaptive decision making with autonomous agents requires trading off exploration of unknown environments with exploitation of prior observations in the search space. Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making.

Abstract: Autonomous odor source localization remains a challenging problem for aerial robots due to turbulent airflow, sparse and delayed sensory signals, and strict payload and compute constraints. While prior unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based olfaction systems have demonstrated gas distribution mapping or reactive plume tracing, they rely on predefined coverage patterns, external infrastructure, or extensive sensing and coordination. In this work, we present a complete, open-source UAV system for online odor source localization using a minimal sensor suite. The system integrates custom olfaction hardware, onboard sensing, and a learning-based navigation policy trained in simulation and deployed on a real quadrotor. Through our minimal framework, the UAV is able to navigate directly toward an odor source without constructing an explicit gas distribution map or relying on external positioning systems. Vision is incorporated as an optional complementary modality to accelerate navigation under certain conditions. We validate the proposed system through real-world flight experiments in a large indoor environment using an ethanol source, demonstrating consistent source-finding behavior under realistic airflow conditions. The primary contribution of this work is a reproducible system and methodological framework for UAV-based olfactory navigation and source finding under minimal sensing assumptions. We elaborate on our hardware design and open source our UAV firmware, simulation code, olfaction-vision dataset, and circuit board to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end learning approaches for robotic state estimation are difficult to interpret and expensive to train due to sequence unrolling. The authors seek an alternative that maintains performance while offering interpretability and composability.

Method: A particle filtering framework where models are trained from individual state transitions (exploiting Markov property). Measurement models are learned implicitly via denoising score matching objective. At inference, learned denoiser and dynamics model approximately solve Bayesian filtering equation, guiding states toward measurement-informed data manifold.

Result: Competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation.

Conclusion: The method offers desirable composability of classical filtering algorithms, allowing incorporation of prior information and external sensor models without retraining, while avoiding expensive end-to-end sequence training.

Abstract: Learning-based methods commonly treat state estimation in robotics as a sequence modeling problem. While this paradigm can be effective at maximizing end-to-end performance, models are often difficult to interpret and expensive to train, since training requires unrolling sequences of predictions in time. As an alternative to end-to-end trained state estimation, we propose a novel particle filtering algorithm in which models are trained from individual state transitions, fully exploiting the Markov property in robotic systems. In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines. Importantly, our method offers the desirable composability of classical filtering algorithms, allowing prior information and external sensor models to be incorporated without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have complementary strengths but also limitations: TO struggles with non-convexity while RL is computationally expensive. Existing hybrid approaches like CACTO face scalability issues with increasing system complexity.

Method: CACTO-BIC introduces two key improvements: 1) Biased initial-state sampling leveraging properties of the value function associated with locally optimal policies to improve data efficiency, and 2) GPU acceleration to reduce computation time.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved sample efficiency and faster computation compared to CACTO. Comparisons with PPO demonstrate achieving similar solutions in less time. Experiments on the AlienGO quadruped robot show scalability to high-dimensional systems suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: CACTO-BIC successfully addresses scalability limitations of previous hybrid TO-RL approaches, enabling practical application to complex, high-dimensional robotic systems with real-time performance requirements.

Abstract: Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer complementary strengths for solving optimal control problems. TO efficiently computes locally optimal solutions but can struggle with non-convexity, while RL is more robust to non-convexity at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. CACTO (Continuous Actor-Critic with Trajectory Optimization) was introduced to combine these advantages by learning a warm-start policy that guides the TO solver towards low-cost trajectories. However, scalability remains a key limitation, as increasing system complexity significantly raises the computational cost of TO. This work introduces CACTO-BIC to address these challenges. CACTO-BIC improves data efficiency by biasing initial-state sampling leveraging a property of the value function associated with locally optimal policies; moreover, it reduces computation time by exploiting GPU acceleration. Empirical evaluations show improved sample efficiency and faster computation compared to CACTO. Comparisons with PPO demonstrate that our approach can achieve similar solutions in less time. Finally, experiments on the AlienGO quadruped robot demonstrate that CACTO-BIC can scale to high-dimensional systems and is suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: DeMUSE validates the necessity of deep multi-sensory integration for complex physical interactions, showing that combining visual, depth, and force modalities significantly improves robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Realizing dexterous embodied manipulation necessitates the deep integration of heterogeneous multimodal sensory inputs. However, current vision-centric paradigms often overlook the critical force and geometric feedback essential for complex tasks. This paper presents DeMUSE, a Deep Multimodal Unified Sparse Experts framework leveraging a Diffusion Transformer to integrate RGB, depth, and 6-axis force into a unified serialized stream. Adaptive Modality-specific Normalization (AdaMN) is employed to recalibrate modality-aware features, mitigating representation imbalance and harmonizing the heterogeneous distributions of multi-sensory signals. To facilitate efficient scaling, the architecture utilizes a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with shared experts, increasing model capacity for physical priors while maintaining the low inference latency required for real-time control. A Joint denoising objective synchronously synthesizes environmental evolution and action sequences to ensure physical consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time deformation prediction in soft materials is challenging for soft robotics. Existing learning-based models for 3D contact estimation have limited generalization to complex scenarios like multi-point sensing due to heavy dependence on training datasets.

Method: Introduces TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Trained on limited single-point indentation data, with augmentation using multi-point contact data to enhance capabilities.

Result: Achieves superior single-point sensing with MAE of 0.0589 mm vs 0.0612 mm for CNN baseline. Multi-point sensing improves from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm MAE for two-point discrimination when augmented with multi-point data.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully extrapolates complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, enabling advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Streamlines development of marker-based soft sensors for scalable real-world tactile perception.

Abstract: Real-time prediction of deformation in highly compliant soft materials remains a significant challenge in soft robotics. While vision-based soft tactile sensors can track internal marker displacements, learning-based models for 3D contact estimation heavily depend on their training datasets, inherently limiting their ability to generalize to complex scenarios such as multi-point sensing. To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm. By successfully extrapolating complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, this methodology unlocks advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Ultimately, it significantly streamlines the development of marker-based soft sensors, offering a highly scalable solution for real-world tactile perception.

Conclusion: Athena provides an open-hardware research platform for rescue robotics, addressing the need for ground robots that can handle unstructured disaster environments while enabling community development through full open-source release.

Abstract: In disaster response and situation assessment, robots have great potential in reducing the risks to the safety and health of first responders. As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles. The manipulator with a maximum reach of 1.54m can be used to operate doors, valves, and other objects of interest. Full CAD & PCB files, as well as all low-level software, are released as open-source contributions.

TL;DR: The paper establishes scaling laws for neural Koopman operators in robotics, showing how sample size and latent dimension affect control performance, and introduces regularizers to improve model fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural Koopman operators are powerful for linearizing and controlling nonlinear robotic systems, their performance depends on the trade-off between sample size and model dimensions, and the scaling laws for this relationship have remained unclear.

Method: The authors derive theoretical upper bounds on Koopman approximation error, decomposing it into sampling and projection errors. They then introduce two lightweight regularizers: a covariance loss to stabilize learned latent features and an inverse control loss to align the model with physical actuation.

Result: Experiments across six robotic environments confirm that model fitting error follows the derived scaling laws, and the regularizers improve dynamic model fitting fidelity with enhanced closed-loop control performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides a simple recipe for allocating effort between data collection and model capacity when learning Koopman dynamics for control, establishing rigorous scaling laws that connect sample size, latent dimension, and control quality.

Abstract: Data-driven neural Koopman operator theory has emerged as a powerful tool for linearizing and controlling nonlinear robotic systems. However, the performance of these data-driven models fundamentally depends on the trade-off between sample size and model dimensions, a relationship for which the scaling laws have remained unclear. This paper establishes a rigorous framework to address this challenge by deriving and empirically validating scaling laws that connect sample size, latent space dimension, and downstream control quality. We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Koopman approximation error, explicitly decomposing it into sampling error and projection error. We show that these terms decay at specific rates relative to dataset size and latent dimension, providing a rigorous basis for the scaling law. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce two lightweight regularizers for the neural Koopman operator: a covariance loss to help stabilize the learned latent features and an inverse control loss to ensure the model aligns with physical actuation. The results from systematic experiments across six robotic environments confirm that model fitting error follows the derived scaling laws, and the regularizers improve dynamic model fitting fidelity, with enhanced closed-loop control performance. Together, our results provide a simple recipe for allocating effort between data collection and model capacity when learning Koopman dynamics for control.

TL;DR: CORE is a safety framework that enables robots to reason about context-dependent safety rules online using vision-language models, ground them in the environment, and enforce them via control barrier functions without prior environmental knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional safety approaches use fixed constraints for user-specified contexts, which fails to handle the open-ended contextual variability in real-world environments where the same space requires different safety strategies depending on context (crowded vs empty, emergency vs normal operations).

Method: CORE uses a vision-language model to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions.

Result: CORE demonstrates contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning, with probabilistic safety guarantees that account for perceptual uncertainty.

Conclusion: CORE addresses the gap in handling contextual variability in open-world environments by enabling online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior environmental knowledge, validated through both theoretical guarantees and experimental results.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly operating in open-world environments where safe behavior depends on context: the same hallway may require different navigation strategies when crowded versus empty, or during an emergency versus normal operations. Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

TL;DR: A robot navigation system that can move clutter to create paths when blocked, using LLM-driven planning with active perception for sequential object placement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual navigation assumes at least one obstacle-free path exists, but real-world environments like homes and warehouses often have clutter blocking all routes. The paper addresses this limitation by enabling robots to actively move obstacles to create paths.

Method: Proposes an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. The LLM reasons over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next. This combines reasoning with active perception to explore task-relevant regions rather than exhaustive mapping.

Result: The approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator. Also demonstrates qualitative performance on real-world hardware.

Conclusion: The Lifelong Interactive Navigation framework enables robots to handle cluttered environments by moving obstacles to create paths, using LLM-driven reasoning with active perception for efficient task completion in sequential object placement scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation typically assumes the existence of at least one obstacle-free path between start and goal, which must be discovered/planned by the robot. However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world dynamic environments. Current approaches lack integrated frameworks that combine world modeling with adaptive learning while handling both visual and physical domain shifts.

Method: AdaWorldPolicy integrates three interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT): a world model, action expert, and force predictor, connected via multi-modal self-attention layers. It introduces Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between Action Generation and Future Imagination modes for reactive updates across all modules.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully enhances robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions by leveraging world models for supervision signals, force-torque feedback for dynamic force shifts, and online adaptive learning for continuous adaptation with minimal human involvement.

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: NovaPlan is a hierarchical framework that combines VLM-based task planning with video generation and geometric execution for zero-shot long-horizon robot manipulation, enabling complex assembly and error recovery without demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes but lack physical grounding needed for real-world robot execution. There's a need to bridge high-level semantic reasoning with low-level physical interaction for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Method: Hierarchical framework with: 1) VLM planner for task decomposition and closed-loop monitoring with autonomous re-planning, 2) Video generation for imagining outcomes, 3) Extraction of object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from videos, 4) Switching mechanism to select better reference for robot actions, 5) Geometrically grounded execution that handles occlusion and depth inaccuracy.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

Conclusion: NovaPlan successfully unifies high-level semantic planning with low-level geometric execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation, enabling robots to handle complex tasks and recover from failures autonomously without requiring demonstrations or training.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon tasks requires robots to integrate high-level semantic reasoning with low-level physical interaction. While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for real-to-sim scene estimation struggle in cluttered environments with prohibitive computational cost, poor robustness, and restricted generality when scaling to multiple interacting objects. There's a need for methods that can robustly reconstruct physically valid, simulation-ready scenes for downstream planning and policy learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed unified optimization-based formulation successfully addresses limitations of existing real-to-sim scene estimation methods, providing a robust, computationally efficient solution that scales well to complex cluttered environments with multiple interacting objects, enabling better downstream planning and policy learning applications.

Abstract: Estimating simulation-ready scenes from real-world observations is crucial for downstream planning and policy learning tasks. Regretfully, existing methods struggle in cluttered environments, often exhibiting prohibitive computational cost, poor robustness, and restricted generality when scaling to multiple interacting objects. We propose a unified optimization-based formulation for real-to-sim scene estimation that jointly recovers the shapes and poses of multiple rigid objects under physical constraints. Our method is built on two key technical innovations. First, we leverage the recently introduced shape-differentiable contact model, whose global differentiability permits joint optimization over object geometry and pose while modeling inter-object contacts. Second, we exploit the structured sparsity of the augmented Lagrangian Hessian to derive an efficient linear system solver whose computational cost scales favorably with scene complexity. Building on this formulation, we develop an end-to-end real-to-sim scene estimation pipeline that integrates learning-based object initialization, physics-constrained joint shape-pose optimization, and differentiable texture refinement. Experiments on cluttered scenes with up to 5 objects and 22 convex hulls demonstrate that our approach robustly reconstructs physically valid, simulation-ready object shapes and poses.

*Sanjeev Panta,Xu Yuan,Li Chen,Nian-Feng Tzeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decomposition-based approach for multivariate time series forecasting that separately handles trend and seasonal components, achieving ~10% MSE reduction over SOTA baselines while maintaining linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting faces significant challenges in real-world applications. The authors aim to enhance existing models by better handling the decomposition of time series into trend and seasonal components, recognizing that different normalization approaches work best for each component.

Method: The approach decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, then handles them separately: using reversible instance normalization for trend components, and applying backbone models directly without normalization for seasonal components. The paper also introduces dual-MLP models as computationally efficient solutions.

Result: The method achieves around 10% average MSE reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. On hydrological data from USGS river stations, it shows significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity.

Conclusion: The decomposition-based approach with component-specific normalization strategies effectively improves multivariate time series forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

TL;DR: A SciML framework combining PBPK Transformers, Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models, and Neural Allometry to improve pharmacokinetic modeling with better biological compliance and faster simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBPK modeling is crucial for drug development but faces challenges: high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation.

Method: Three-part SciML framework: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers for sequence modeling of pharmacokinetic forecasting, (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models with physics-informed loss for generating biologically compliant virtual patient populations, (3) Neural Allometry combining GNNs with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets show the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering faster simulation capabilities.

Conclusion: The unified SciML framework successfully bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility, addressing key limitations of traditional PBPK modeling for improved drug development applications.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.

*Guoqi Yu,Juncheng Wang,Chen Yang,Jing Qin,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoTAR is a centralized MLP-based module that replaces Transformer's decentralized attention for medical time series analysis, achieving better performance with lower computational cost by using a global core token for centralized aggregation and redistribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical time series data (EEG/ECG) have both temporal dependencies within channels and channel dependencies across channels. While Transformers capture temporal dependencies well, they struggle with channel dependencies due to structural mismatch - MedTS signals are centralized while Transformer attention is decentralized.

Method: Proposes CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module that replaces Transformer's decentralized attention. Instead of direct token interactions, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy for inter-token interactions, implementing centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority in effectiveness and efficiency: up to 12.13% improvement on APAVA dataset, using only 33% of memory and 20% of inference time compared to previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoTAR better aligns with centralized nature of medical time series signals while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear, offering an effective and efficient solution for MedTS analysis.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of medical time series (MedTS) data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), plays a pivotal role in healthcare applications, including the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDD and Deep SVDD adapted for radar target detection to handle heavy-tailed clutter distributions, avoiding direct noise covariance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical radar detectors degrade in heavy-tailed clutter environments (CES/CGD distributions), and robust estimators struggle with combined thermal noise and clutter.

Method: Adapt Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Deep SVDD as CFAR detectors, proposing two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Conclusion: SVDD-based approaches provide effective radar detection in challenging clutter environments without requiring direct noise covariance estimation.

Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMA is a reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and QA in a single policy, using dual memory (core summary + structured Memory Bank) to proactively manage information in long streams, outperforming long-context LLMs and RAG on dynamic reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context LLMs and RAG systems process information passively, deferring state tracking, contradiction resolution, and evidence aggregation to query time, which becomes brittle under ultra long streams with frequent updates.

Method: UMA is an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and question answering within a single policy. It maintains a dual memory representation: a compact core summary for global context and a structured Memory Bank that supports explicit CRUD (create, update, delete, reorganize) over key-value entries, enabling proactive consolidation during streaming.

Result: UMA substantially outperforms long-context and RAG baselines on dynamic reasoning and learning tasks across 13 datasets spanning Ledger-QA, Test-Time Learning, and Accurate Retrieval, while remaining competitive on standard retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of learned, end-to-end memory management for handling dynamic information in long streams, demonstrating that proactive memory consolidation outperforms passive processing approaches.

Abstract: Long-context LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems process information passively, deferring state tracking, contradiction resolution, and evidence aggregation to query time, which becomes brittle under ultra long streams with frequent updates. We propose the Unified Memory Agent (UMA), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and question answering within a single policy. UMA maintains a dual memory representation: a compact core summary for global context and a structured Memory Bank that supports explicit CRUD (create, update, delete, reorganize) over key value entries, enabling proactive consolidation during streaming. To evaluate long-horizon memory behavior, we introduce Ledger-QA, a diagnostic benchmark for continuous state tracking where answers are latent values derived from accumulated updates rather than lo cal span retrieval. Across 13 datasets spanning Ledger-QA, Test-Time Learning, and Accurate Retrieval, UMA substantially outperforms long-context and RAG baselines on dynamic reasoning and learning tasks while remaining competitive on standard retrieval benchmarks, underscoring the importance of learned, end-to-end memory management.

TL;DR: Weak-form evolutionary KAN framework for scalable and stable PDE solution prediction, addressing limitations of strong-form approaches through weak formulation and rigorous boundary condition enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong-form evolutionary neural networks for time-dependent PDEs suffer from ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization and poor computational scaling with training samples. Need for more stable and scalable approaches.

Method: Proposes weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) framework that decouples linear system size from training samples via weak formulation. Uses boundary-constrained KANs for Dirichlet/periodic conditions and incorporates derivative boundary conditions directly into weak formulation for Neumann conditions.

Result: Provides stable and scalable approach for PDE solution prediction with improved computational efficiency compared to strong-form methods. Framework enables rigorous boundary condition enforcement.

Conclusion: Weak-form evolutionary KAN framework offers stable, scalable solution for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential engineering applications.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form a central component of scientific computing. Among recent advances in deep learning, evolutionary neural networks have been developed to successively capture the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs via parameter evolution. The parameter updates are obtained by solving a linear system derived from the governing equation residuals at each time step. However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yield ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization, and their computational cost scales unfavorably with the number of training samples. To address these limitations, we propose a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the scalable and accurate prediction of PDE solutions. We decouple the linear system size from the number of training samples through the weak formulation, leading to improved scalability compared to strong-form approaches. We also rigorously enforce boundary conditions by constructing the trial space with boundary-constrained KANs to satisfy Dirichlet and periodic conditions, and by incorporating derivative boundary conditions directly into the weak formulation for Neumann conditions. In conclusion, the proposed weak-form evolutionary KAN framework provides a stable and scalable approach for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential relevance to future engineering applications.

*Attila Dobi,Aravindh Manickavasagam,Benjamin Thompson,Xiaohan Yang,Faisal Farooq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A design-based measurement system for accurately estimating content violation prevalence using ML-assisted sampling and multimodal LLM labeling to provide unbiased daily estimates with confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect actual user experiences rather than just reported violations. Current methods are challenged by rare violations, costly human labeling, and the need for frequent platform-representative studies.

Method: Three-part system: (1) Daily probability sampling from impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure/high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness; (2) Labeling sampled items with multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation; (3) Producing design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns.

Result: A configurable system that provides one global sample supporting multiple pivots (by surface, geography, content age, etc.) through post-stratified estimation, with statistical estimators, variance/confidence interval construction, and label-quality monitoring.

Conclusion: The system enables accurate prevalence measurement of content violations at scale, addressing challenges of rare events and labeling costs while providing actionable insights through flexible segmentation and statistical rigor.

Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new continuous vision layer for soccer analytics that uses pose tracking to create probabilistic vision maps, overcoming limitations of traditional binary VEA counting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual exploratory behavior measurement in soccer has several limitations: player position bias (focusing on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (scanning or not), inability to predict short-term in-game success, and incompatibility with fundamental soccer analytics models like pitch control.

Method: Developed a formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer using pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Created probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporating head and shoulder rotation angles to generate speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in 2D top-down plane. Combined vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze awaiting phase (when player awaits a pass) and subsequent on-ball phase.

Result: Aggregated visual metrics (e.g., percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass) predict controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions. Validated using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. Method works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation, and provides continuous measurements.

Conclusion: The novel continuous vision layer successfully addresses limitations of traditional VEA counting methods, provides predictive power for in-game success, integrates seamlessly with existing soccer analytics frameworks, and is made accessible through open-source tools.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125°/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous stress forecasting could contribute to lifestyle interventions, but existing approaches lack personalization and explainability. Consumer-grade smartwatches offer accessible physiological data for stress prediction.

Method: Developed time series forecasting model using multivariate features (heart rate variability, activity patterns, sleep metrics) from smartwatches. Evaluated across 16 temporal horizons with different history (3-9 days) and forecasting (1-7 days) windows. Compared against state-of-the-art models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM).

Result: Model achieved MSE 0.053, MAE 0.190, RMSE 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). Outperformed all baseline models with 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% improvements over best baseline. Sleep metrics were most dominant predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features showed high inter-participant variability.

Conclusion: Consumer wearables combined with adaptive, interpretable deep learning can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

Abstract: Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

TL;DR: InfoNoise is a data-adaptive noise schedule for diffusion models that replaces heuristic manual tuning with information-theoretic noise sampling based on conditional entropy rates, achieving better performance with fewer training steps across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models rely on manually tuned noise schedules that waste computation on uninformative noise regions and don't transfer well across different datasets, resolutions, and representations. There's a need for a principled, data-adaptive approach to noise scheduling.

Method: The authors propose InfoNoise, which uses the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a diagnostic for suboptimal noise allocation. They derive an information-guided noise sampling distribution from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training, making the schedule data-adaptive.

Result: InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules on natural-image benchmarks (with ~1.4× speedup on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets where standard schedules have significant mismatch, it achieves superior quality in up to 3× fewer training steps.

Conclusion: InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains, providing a principled alternative to heuristic schedule tuning.

Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.

### [389] [The Geometry of Multi-Task Grokking: Transverse Instability, Superposition, and Weight Decay Phase Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18523)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task grokking in modular arithmetic reveals staggered generalization order, invariant low-dimensional manifolds, weight decay phase structure, holographic incompressibility, and transverse fragility with redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend geometric analysis of grokking (abrupt transition from memorization to generalization) from single-task to multi-task settings, specifically studying shared-trunk Transformers on modular arithmetic tasks.

Method: Train shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across systematic weight decay sweeps, analyzing optimization trajectories, manifold structure, and solution properties.

Result: Five consistent phenomena: (1) staggered grokking order (multiplication→squaring→addition), (2) universal integrability with invariant low-dimensional execution manifold, (3) weight decay phase structure with distinct dynamical regimes, (4) holographic incompressibility where solutions occupy few principal directions but are distributed across full-rank weights, (5) transverse fragility with redundancy where removing orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking but partial recovery occurs under extreme deletion.

Conclusion: Multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization long after near-zero training loss -- has been studied mainly in single-task settings. We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

*Sarthak Kumar Maharana,Akshay Mehra,Bhavya Ramakrishna,Yunhui Guo,Guan-Ming Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AV-CTTA: A method for audio-visual continual test-time adaptation that selectively retrieves and adapts fusion layer parameters to prevent catastrophic forgetting without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-visual continual test-time adaptation methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to non-stationary domains with distribution shifts in either or both modalities, leading to performance degradation below source model levels.

Method: Proposes AV-CTTA which adapts only the modality fusion layer, uses selective parameter retrieval from a buffer using small test batches, dynamically integrates best parameters, adapts to current distribution, and saves them for future use.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with unimodal and bimodal corruptions show AV-CTTA significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Adapting only the fusion layer with selective parameter retrieval enables effective continual test-time adaptation without source data, leveraging cross-task transferability to improve performance across domains.

Abstract: Audio-visual continual test-time adaptation involves continually adapting a source audio-visual model at test-time, to unlabeled non-stationary domains, where either or both modalities can be distributionally shifted, which hampers online cross-modal learning and eventually leads to poor accuracy. While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

### [391] [Adaptation to Intrinsic Dependence in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20126)
*Yunxiao Zhao,Changxiao Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for diffusion language models that adapts to unknown data dependence structures, with theoretical convergence guarantees scaling with intrinsic data complexity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of diffusion language models as alternatives to autoregressive approaches, there's limited theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules affect generation quality. Current deterministic procedures lack adaptivity to data dependence structures.

Method: Proposes a randomized unmasking schedule that adapts to unknown data dependence structure without prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. Randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration, with specific parameter choices providing theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees scale as Õ(TC/K) and Õ(DTC/K), where TC and DTC are total correlation and dual total correlation capturing data dependence structure. Results hold in parallel-sampling regime (K<L) and improve upon prior convergence theories.

Conclusion: The findings reveal DLMs' adaptivity to intrinsic data structures and demonstrate benefits of randomized unmasking sizes for sampling acceleration, particularly for low-complexity distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.

*Abeer Alsheikhi,Amirfarhad Farhadi,Azadeh Zamanifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINN-based surrogate models accelerate RL training for smart grid energy management by 50%, enabling strong policy learning without expensive simulator interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grid energy management is complex due to interdependencies, and RL for OPF problems requires computationally expensive simulators leading to sample inefficiency.

Method: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogate models to replace costly smart grid simulators, enhancing RL policy learning by incorporating knowledge of underlying physical laws.

Result: PINN surrogate is the only approach that can obtain strong RL policies without true simulator samples, accelerating training by 50% compared to RL without surrogate, achieving similar performance scores.

Conclusion: PINN-based surrogates effectively address computational challenges in smart grid RL applications, enabling faster convergence and strong policy learning while reducing dependency on expensive simulators.

Abstract: The energy management problem in the context of smart grids is inherently complex due to the interdependencies among diverse system components. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator.

*Baris Arat,Hasan Fehmi Ates,Emre Sefer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weekly sub-city real estate price forecasting using satellite radar (SAR) and news sentiment improves long-horizon predictions by 35% compared to price history alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: City-level real estate price indicators are published at low frequency and lack neighborhood-scale granularity, limiting their usefulness for local monitoring and long-term planning.

Method: Combined regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data, news sentiment analysis (lexical tone + semantic embeddings), and macroeconomic context to forecast weekly price indices for 19 Dubai sub-city regions (2-34 weeks ahead).

Result: Horizon-dependent results: price history alone works well up to 10 weeks, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At 26-34 weeks, multimodal model reduces MAE from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% improvement). Nonparametric learners outperform deep architectures.

Conclusion: Remote sensing and news sentiment significantly improve sub-city real estate price predictability at strategically relevant long horizons, establishing benchmarks for weekly neighborhood-scale forecasting.

Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.

### [394] [Learning Beyond Optimization: Stress-Gated Dynamical Regime Regulation in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18581)
*Sheng Ran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for autonomous learning without explicit objectives, using internal stress signals to regulate structural plasticity and trigger self-organized learning episodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML relies on fixed objective functions, but true autonomy requires systems to operate without explicit goals in evolving contexts. Need mechanisms for self-assessment and regulation when objectives are ill-defined or absent.

Method: Two-timescale architecture: fast state evolution + slow structural adaptation, coupled through internally generated stress variable. Stress accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction, triggering structural modification as state-dependent events rather than continuous optimization.

Result: Demonstrated through minimal toy model that stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without external goals.

Conclusion: Proposes a route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization, moving beyond explicit objective functions.

Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

### [395] [GIST: Targeted Data Selection for Instruction Tuning via Coupled Optimization Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18584)
*Guanghui Min,Tianhao Huang,Ke Wan,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIST is a targeted data selection method for efficient instruction tuning that addresses limitations of existing approaches in PEFT settings like LoRA, using subspace alignment instead of axis-aligned scaling for better gradient geometry modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing targeted data selection methods rely on optimizer statistics (Adam states) as axis-aligned surrogates for update geometry, assuming parameter independence. This assumption breaks down in PEFT methods like LoRA where optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling and task-relevant updates are confined to low-dimensional subspaces.

Method: GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation) replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. It recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.

Result: Extensive experiments show GIST matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while using only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.

Conclusion: GIST provides a simple yet principled alternative to existing data selection methods that better accounts for the coupled optimization geometry in PEFT settings, achieving superior efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Targeted data selection has emerged as a crucial paradigm for efficient instruction tuning, aiming to identify a small yet influential subset of training examples for a specific target task. In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.

TL;DR: ETAP is a scalable framework that predicts multi-task learning performance gains by combining gradient-based affinity scores with data-driven predictors to identify beneficial task groupings without expensive training of all combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning requires identifying which tasks benefit from joint learning, but evaluating all possible task combinations is computationally prohibitive for large task sets. There's a need for efficient methods to predict MTL performance gains without exhaustive training.

Method: ETAP integrates two components: 1) A linear gradient-based affinity score measuring similarity between task parameter updates, which extends to task groups; 2) Data-driven predictors that apply non-linear transformations to refine estimates and capture complex task relationships, trained on limited ground-truth MTL gain data.

Result: ETAP improves MTL gain prediction accuracy and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmark datasets and application domains.

Conclusion: ETAP provides a scalable solution for predicting multi-task learning benefits, combining principled gradient analysis with data-driven refinement to efficiently identify optimal task groupings without exhaustive training.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in multi-task learning (MTL) is identifying groups of tasks that should be learned together. Since training MTL models for all possible combinations of tasks is prohibitively expensive for large task sets, a crucial component of efficient and effective task grouping is predicting whether a group of tasks would benefit from learning together, measured as per-task performance gain over single-task learning. In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that ETAP improves MTL gain prediction and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are insufficient for rigorously assessing constrained reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which is crucial for advancing Artificial General Intelligence.

Method: Created MapTab benchmark with two scenarios: Metromap (metro networks in 160 cities) and Travelmap (168 tourist attractions). It includes 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries with 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability.

Result: Evaluation of 15 representative MLLMs shows substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Under limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches.

Conclusion: MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance systematic evaluation of MLLMs, revealing current limitations in constrained multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Systematic evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

*Baris Arat,Emre Sefer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers introduce a controlled diagnostic for isolating reranking behavior by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools, eliminating retrieval variance to study ranking policies alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reranking evaluations couple ranking behavior with retrieval quality, making it impossible to attribute differences in output to ranking policy alone. The authors want to isolate and study reranking behavior independently.

Method: Use Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools, limit each pool to exactly eight documents, and pass identical inputs to all rankers. BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable baselines for lexical matching and diversity optimization.

Result: Across 345 clusters, redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets, and their rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy.

Conclusion: By eliminating retrieval variance, differences can be attributed directly to ranking policy. The diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

Abstract: Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

*Sarim Chaudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NIWF replaces fixed neural network weights with learned functions that generate weight configurations from a continuous capability space, enabling zero catastrophic forgetting through functional locking of committed tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to catastrophic forgetting (regularization, replay buffers, adapters) lack structural guarantees against forgetting. The fundamental limitation is that LLMs store all knowledge in a single fixed weight vector, making it impossible to add new capabilities without degrading existing ones.

Method: Proposes Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF) - a framework that replaces fixed weights with learned functions that generate weight configurations from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, the occupied coordinate region is committed by snapshotting field outputs on anchor points to enforce functional locking during future training.

Result: Validated on sequential instruction-following and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks.

Conclusion: NIWF introduces software-like versioning for neural network intelligence, enabling capabilities to be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining, providing a structural solution to catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large language models store all learned knowledge in a single, fixed weight vector. Teaching a model new capabilities requires modifying those same weights, inevitably degrading previously acquired knowledge. This fundamental limitation, known as catastrophic forgetting, has resisted principled solutions for decades. Existing approaches treat weights as immutable artifacts that must be protected through techniques like regularization heuristics, replay buffers, or isolated adapter modules. The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training. We validate NIWF on sequential instructionfollowing and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks. The framework introduces the notion of software-like versioning for neural network intelligence, where capabilities can be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining.

*Alejandro de Miguel,Nelson Totah,Uri Maoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-invasive EEG can accurately decode self-paced locomotion speed in rats using recurrent neural networks, achieving 0.88 correlation primarily from visual cortex and low-frequency oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous locomotion decoding studies have been limited to motorized treadmills with externally imposed pace, require intracranial implants, and show modest accuracy. There's a need for non-invasive decoding of self-paced locomotion in natural contexts.

Method: Developed an asynchronous BCI using 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01-45 Hz) on head-fixed rats running on non-motorized treadmills. Used recurrent neural networks trained on 133+ hours of recordings to map EEG activity to instantaneous speed.

Result: Achieved 0.88 correlation (R²=0.78) for speed decoding, driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency (<8 Hz) oscillations. Decoders generalized across sessions within same rat but not across animals. Cortical states contained information about speed dynamics extending ±1000 ms.

Conclusion: Self-paced locomotion speed can be accurately decoded from non-invasive EEG, providing a framework for high-performing non-invasive BCIs and advancing understanding of distributed neural representations of action dynamics.

Abstract: $\textit{Objective.}$ Accurate neural decoding of locomotion holds promise for advancing rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and understanding neural correlates of action. Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of locomotion kinematics across species on motorized treadmills. However, efforts to decode locomotion speed in more natural contexts$-$where pace is self-selected rather than externally imposed$-$are scarce, generally achieve only modest accuracy, and require intracranial implants. Here, we aim to decode self-paced locomotion speed non-invasively and continuously using cortex-wide EEG recordings from rats. $\textit{Approach.}$ We introduce an asynchronous brain$-$computer interface (BCI) that processes a stream of 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01$-$45 Hz) to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill during self-paced locomotion in head-fixed rats. Using recurrent neural networks and a dataset of over 133 h of recordings, we trained decoders to map ongoing EEG activity to treadmill speed. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our decoding achieves a correlation of 0.88 ($R^2$ = 0.78) for speed, primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency ($< 8$ Hz) oscillations. Moreover, pre-training on a single session permitted decoding on other sessions from the same rat, suggesting uniform neural signatures that generalize across sessions but fail to transfer across animals. Finally, we found that cortical states not only carry information about current speed, but also about future and past dynamics, extending up to 1000 ms. $\textit{Significance.}$ These findings demonstrate that self-paced locomotion speed can be decoded accurately and continuously from non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG. Our approach provides a framework for developing high-performing, non-invasive BCI systems and contributes to understanding distributed neural representations of action dynamics.

*Leonardo F. Toso,Davit Shadunts,Yunyang Lu,Nihal Sharma,Donglin Zhan,Nam H. Nguyen,James Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a bisimulation encoder to improve robustness of world models by filtering out slow features like background changes and distractors, achieving better test-time robustness with 10x smaller latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent predictive architectures (like DINO-WM) suffer from test-time robustness degradation due to sensitivity to "slow features" - visual variations like background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the actual task being solved.

Method: Augments the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence. This maps states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. The approach is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder.

Result: Consistently improves robustness to slow features across benchmarks with different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Operates in a reduced latent space up to 10x smaller than DINO-WM. Maintains robustness when paired with various pretrained visual encoders (DINOv2, SimDINOv2, iBOT).

Conclusion: The bisimulation encoder effectively addresses the slow feature sensitivity problem in world models, enabling more robust decision-making in latent space while significantly reducing model complexity through smaller latent representations.

Abstract: World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.

*Shvat Messica,Jiawen Zhang,Kevin Li,Theodoros Tsiligkaridis,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARTIST introduces a controller-reasoner architecture for time-series reasoning that adaptively selects relevant temporal segments instead of encoding entire sequences, achieving significant accuracy improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-series reasoning approaches encode entire sequences into fixed representations regardless of relevance, which is inefficient when evidence only appears in short intervals. The paper aims to enable models to selectively focus on task-relevant information.

Method: ARTIST uses a controller-reasoner architecture with reinforcement learning. The controller selects informative temporal segments, while the reasoner generates segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. A hierarchical policy optimization approach is used for post-training.

Result: ARTIST achieves 6.46 percentage point average accuracy improvement over the strongest baseline across six time-series reasoning benchmarks. Largest gains are on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Selective data use through adaptive segment selection drives effective time-series reasoning. Reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection beyond supervised fine-tuning alone.

Abstract: Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.

### [403] [Global Low-Rank, Local Full-Rank: The Holographic Encoding of Learned Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18649)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking solutions are globally low-dimensional in learning trajectory space but locally full-rank in parameter space, revealing holographic encoding where algorithms emerge from coordinated updates across all matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the paradox of how low-dimensional learning dynamics in grokking can produce solutions that resist low-dimensional compression in parameter space, despite neural networks operating in extremely high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Trained shared-trunk Transformers on multi-task modular arithmetic (addition, multiplication, quadratic operations modulo 97) across three model scales and five weight decay settings. Compared three reconstruction methods: per-matrix SVD, joint cross-matrix SVD, and trajectory PCA.

Result: Grokking trajectories are confined to 2-6 dimensional global subspace while individual weight matrices remain effectively full-rank. Reconstruction from 3-5 trajectory PCs recovers over 95% of final accuracy, whereas both per-matrix and joint SVD fail at sub-full rank. Static decompositions destroy task-relevant structure even when capturing most spectral energy.

Conclusion: Learned algorithms are encoded through dynamically coordinated updates spanning all matrices rather than localized low-rank components. This "holographic encoding principle" shows grokked solutions are globally low-rank in learning directions but locally full-rank in parameter space, with implications for compression, interpretability, and understanding neural network computation encoding.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after extended training -- has been linked to the emergence of low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. Yet neural network parameters inhabit extremely high-dimensional spaces. How can a low-dimensional learning process produce solutions that resist low-dimensional compression?
  We investigate this question in multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers with separate heads for addition, multiplication, and a quadratic operation modulo 97. Across three model scales (315K--2.2M parameters) and five weight decay settings, we compare three reconstruction methods: per-matrix SVD, joint cross-matrix SVD, and trajectory PCA.
  Across all conditions, grokking trajectories are confined to a 2--6 dimensional global subspace, while individual weight matrices remain effectively full-rank. Reconstruction from 3--5 trajectory PCs recovers over 95\% of final accuracy, whereas both per-matrix and joint SVD fail at sub-full rank. Even when static decompositions capture most spectral energy, they destroy task-relevant structure.
  These results show that learned algorithms are encoded through dynamically coordinated updates spanning all matrices, rather than localized low-rank components. We term this the holographic encoding principle: grokked solutions are globally low-rank in the space of learning directions but locally full-rank in parameter space, with implications for compression, interpretability, and understanding how neural networks encode computation.

*Yinan Zou,Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher,Christopher G. Brinton,Vishrant Tripathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Potara: A principled framework for federated personalization that optimally merges federated and local models using closed-form mixing weights derived from linear mode connectivity theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA struggle with task-level heterogeneity in federated settings. Current approaches rely on heuristic mixing rules without theoretical justification and are computationally/communication intensive for federated deployments.

Method: Potara constructs personalized models by merging two complementary models: (1) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (2) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Using linear mode connectivity theory, it derives closed-form optimal mixing weights by minimizing a variance trace upper bound of expected task loss.

Result: Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, achieving strong performance-communication trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Potara provides a theoretically-grounded, efficient solution for federated personalization that outperforms heuristic methods by optimally balancing general and personalized knowledge through principled model merging.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, offer a practical way to adapt large vision and language models to client tasks. However, this becomes particularly challenging under task-level heterogeneity in federated deployments. In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off.

### [405] [Large Causal Models for Temporal Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18662)
*Nikolaos Kougioulis,Nikolaos Gkorgkolis,MingXue Wang,Bora Caglayan,Dario Simionato,Andrea Tonon,Ioannis Tsamardinos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LCMs (Large Causal Models) are proposed as a foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery, enabling multi-dataset pretraining that scales to higher variable counts and maintains strong performance across synthetic and realistic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery follows dataset-specific approaches that limit multi-dataset pretraining potential. Current methods are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization.

Method: A principled framework combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets to enable learning at scale. The approach allows training large neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery.

Result: LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. They achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, with fast single-pass inference.

Conclusion: LCMs represent a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery, demonstrating the viability of pre-trained neural architectures for causal discovery tasks across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how robust parameterized neural networks are to random input perturbations, specifically analyzing the probability that small random perturbations cause misclassification.

Method: Theoretical study focusing on deep networks with rectified linear units (ReLUs), analyzing local robustness at given network inputs by quantifying misclassification probability from small additive random perturbations.

### [407] [Transformers for dynamical systems learn transfer operators in-context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18679)
*Anthony Bao,Jeffrey Lai,William Gilpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on one dynamical system can forecast different systems without retraining via in-context learning, using delay embedding to detect manifolds and identifying invariant sets for forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how foundation models achieve zero-shot transfer between physical systems (in-context learning) and clarify the mechanisms enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen dynamical systems without retraining.

Method: Train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, then evaluate its ability to forecast different dynamical systems without retraining. Analyze the model's internal mechanisms and training dynamics.

Result: Discovered early tradeoff between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (secondary double descent phenomenon). Found that attention-based models use transfer-operator forecasting: (1) delay embedding to lift time series and detect higher-dimensional manifolds, (2) identification of long-lived invariant sets to characterize global flow.

Conclusion: Attention-based models leverage global attractor information for short-term forecasts, explaining how large pretrained models can forecast unseen physical systems without retraining through in-context learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.

*Baiting Luo,Yunuo Zhang,Nathaniel S. Keplinger,Samir Gupta,Abhishek Dubey,Ayan Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: I-TAP is an offline RL framework that combines in-context adaptation with online planning in learned discrete temporal-abstraction space, enabling efficient planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning-based RL for continuous control faces two key issues: planning at primitive time scales causes prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are often partially observable with regime shifts that break stationary dynamics assumptions.

Method: I-TAP learns from offline trajectories: 1) an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses observation-macro-action segments into coarse-to-fine discrete residual tokens, and 2) a temporal Transformer that predicts these token stacks from recent history. At test time, it performs Monte Carlo Tree Search in token space using short histories for implicit adaptation, then decodes selected tokens into executable actions.

Result: Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation (including partially observable variants), I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines.

Conclusion: I-TAP demonstrates efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability by unifying in-context adaptation with online planning in learned discrete temporal-abstraction space.

Abstract: Planning-based reinforcement learning for continuous control is bottlenecked by two practical issues: planning at primitive time scales leads to prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are frequently partially observable and exhibit regime shifts that invalidate stationary, fully observed dynamics assumptions. We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

### [409] [Insertion Based Sequence Generation with Learnable Order Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18695)
*Dhruvesh Patel,Benjamin Rozonoyer,Gaurav Pandey,Tahira Naseem,Ramón Fernandez Astudillo,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to incorporate trainable order dynamics into discrete flow matching for insertion-based sequence generation, improving over uniform order dynamics and making joint training tractable without numerical simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insertion models offer greater flexibility than autoregressive models for variable-length sequence generation, but their larger action space makes learning challenging. The paper aims to address this by developing tractable methods to learn optimal insertion orders.

Method: The approach incorporates trainable order dynamics into target rates for discrete flow matching, using suitable parameterizations that enable joint training without numerical simulation. A variable-length masked diffusion model serves as the generative insertion model, generating sequences by inserting and filling mask tokens.

Result: On graph traversal tasks with known optimal insertion orders, the method demonstrates trade-offs between flexibility, training stability, and generation quality. For de novo small molecule generation, learned order dynamics increases valid molecule generation and improves quality compared to uniform order dynamics.

Conclusion: Trainable order dynamics can be effectively incorporated into discrete flow matching for insertion models, leading to improved generation quality and validity compared to uniform order approaches, with tractable joint training that avoids numerical simulation.

Abstract: In many domains generating variable length sequences through insertions provides greater flexibility over autoregressive models. However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics.

### [410] [Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18728)
*Mingdong Lu,Zhikui Chen,Meng Liu,Shubin Ma,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning for unsupervised multi-view clustering, modeling cross-view directional agreement as phase terms combined with magnitude backbones to form complex magnetic affinities, extracting stable shared spectral signals via Hermitian magnetic Laplacian for self-supervised representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised multi-view clustering methods struggle with obtaining reliable shared structural signals when views have contradictory directional tendencies despite comparable strengths, which distorts global spectral geometry and degrades clustering performance.

Method: Models cross-view directional agreement as phase terms combined with nonnegative magnitude backbones to form complex-valued magnetic affinities; extracts stable shared spectral signals via Hermitian magnetic Laplacian; uses this as structured self-supervision for representation learning; constructs compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and applies lightweight refinement to suppress noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate consistent outperformance over strong baselines.

Conclusion: Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning effectively addresses the challenge of obtaining reliable shared structural signals in unsupervised multi-view clustering by explicitly modeling directional agreement and extracting stable spectral geometry, leading to improved clustering performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

*Trishita Tiwari,Ari Trachtenberg,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a lightweight training-free method to distinguish genuine memorization from statistical commonality in LLM outputs, showing that 55-90% of previously labeled "memorized" sequences are actually statistically common patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to measuring training data leakage in LLMs conflate genuine memorization with generation of statistically common sequences, leading to overestimation of privacy/security/copyright risks. Existing methods like Counterfactual Memorization are computationally expensive due to requiring multiple model retrainings.

Method: Proposes Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded training-free criterion that evaluates whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.

Result: Evaluation on LLaMA and OPT training corpora shows 55-90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are actually statistically common. On SATML extraction challenge dataset, ~40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in training data.

Conclusion: Low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization. The proposed Prior-Aware Memorization method effectively distinguishes genuine memorization from statistical commonality, providing a practical solution for assessing training data leakage risks without expensive retraining.

Abstract: Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.
  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.
  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative world models are increasingly used for controllable driving video synthesis, but their reliance on physical priors creates new attack surfaces that haven't been explored. Current security vulnerabilities in these models need to be identified and quantified.

Method: Two-stage optimization: (1) Quality-preserving guidance stage constrains reverse-diffusion loss below calibrated threshold; (2) Momentum-guided denoising stage accumulates target-aligned gradients along denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts.

Result: Attack remains effective while increasing FID by ~9% and FVD by ~3.9% on average. Targeted attack success rate reaches 0.55. Downstream effects: attacked videos decrease 3D detection performance by ~4% and worsen open-loop planning by ~20%.

Conclusion: First demonstration and quantification of security vulnerabilities in generative world models, revealing tangible risks that necessitate more comprehensive security checkers for these systems.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) are increasingly used to synthesize controllable, sensor-conditioned driving videos, yet their reliance on physical priors exposes novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.

TL;DR: Hierarchical traffic control framework for mixed HV/CAV traffic using MARL for signal control and ML-based trajectory planning for eco-driving, improving speed by 7.67%, fuel by 10.23%, and idling by 45.83% at 60% CAV penetration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance network efficiency and reduce energy consumption in mixed traffic environments with both human-driven and connected automated vehicles by jointly optimizing traffic signal control and vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors.

Method: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Value Decomposition Network (VDN) for traffic signal control, combined with Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) for Signal Phase and Timing prediction to guide CAV eco-driving maneuvers.

Result: MARL-based TSC outperforms Webster baseline in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. With MLTPA, additional improvements in energy consumption and idling. At 60% CAV proportion: 7.67% speed improvement, 10.23% fuel savings, 45.83% idling reduction.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework effectively improves mixed traffic performance, with significant benefits increasing with CAV penetration. The study demonstrates the value of integrating signal control optimization with vehicle-level eco-driving strategies for sustainable transportation systems.

Abstract: This study presents a hierarchical, network-level traffic flow control framework for mixed traffic consisting of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL approaches for radio map estimation are limited to 2D near-ground scenarios and fail to capture 3D signal propagation characteristics and antenna polarization effects due to scarce 3D data and training challenges.

Method: 1) Efficient data synthesis method using parametric target model capturing 2D ray-tracing and 3D channel fading to generate Radio3DMix dataset; 2) 3D model training scheme based on conditional GAN (cGAN) producing a 3D U-Net for accurate radio map estimation under diverse input features.

Result: RadioGen3D surpasses all baselines in both estimation accuracy and speed. Fine-tuning experiments demonstrate strong generalization capability through successful knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: RadioGen3D framework effectively addresses 3D radio map estimation challenges by combining synthetic data generation with cGAN-based training, enabling accurate and efficient 3D radio resource management for future 6G and low-altitude networks.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for efficient radio resource management in future 6G and low-altitude networks. While deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as an efficient alternative to conventional ray-tracing for radio map estimation (RME), most existing DL approaches are confined to 2D near-ground scenarios. They often fail to capture essential 3D signal propagation characteristics and antenna polarization effects, primarily due to the scarcity of 3D data and training challenges. To address these limitations, we present the RadioGen3D framework. First, we propose an efficient data synthesis method to generate high-quality 3D radio map data. By establishing a parametric target model that captures 2D ray-tracing and 3D channel fading characteristics, we derive realistic coefficient combinations from minimal real measurements, enabling the construction of a large-scale synthetic dataset, Radio3DMix. Utilizing this dataset, we propose a 3D model training scheme based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), yielding a 3D U-Net capable of accurate RME under diverse input feature combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioGen3D surpasses all baselines in both estimation accuracy and speed. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments verify its strong generalization capability via successful knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Understanding disease-gene associations is essential for unravelling disease mechanisms and advancing diagnostics and therapeutics. Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

*Xikai Yang,Sebastian Sun,Yilin Li,Yue Xing,Ming Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaliCausalRank: A unified ad ranking framework that addresses score scale inconsistency and position bias through integrated training-time calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Production ad ranking systems face two critical challenges: 1) score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and 2) position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies, making it difficult to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives like CTR, CVR, revenue, and user experience.

Method: CaliCausalRank integrates three key components: 1) Training-time scale calibration as a first-class objective rather than post-hoc processing, 2) Lagrangian relaxation for constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and 3) Variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation of utility.

Result: Experiments on Criteo and Avazu datasets show CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank), while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

Conclusion: CaliCausalRank provides an effective unified framework for ad ranking that addresses fundamental challenges in production systems through integrated calibration, constraint optimization, and robust counterfactual estimation, leading to improved performance and consistency across traffic segments.

Abstract: Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

### [417] [From Few-Shot to Zero-Shot: Towards Generalist Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18793)
*Yixin Liu,Shiyuan Li,Yu Zheng,Qingfeng Chen,Chengqi Zhang,Philip S. Yu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC is a few-shot generalist graph anomaly detection method that uses in-context learning to detect anomalies across multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining, with ARC_zero extending it to zero-shot label-free inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GAD methods require dataset-specific training ("one-model-for-one-dataset"), which is computationally expensive, lacks generalization to new datasets, and struggles in privacy-sensitive scenarios with limited data/label access.

Method: ARC uses three modules: feature Alignment to unify features across datasets, Residual GNN encoder for dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and cross-attentive in-Context learning with few-shot normal samples. ARC_zero adds pseudo-context mechanism for label-free inference.

Result: Experiments on 17 real-world datasets show both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed generalist GAD paradigm with ARC/ARC_zero addresses limitations of dataset-specific methods, enabling unified anomaly detection across multiple unseen datasets with minimal training/label requirements.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of "one-model-for-one-dataset", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDTA generalizes LDA by replacing Dirichlet prior with Dirichlet-Tree distribution, enabling tree-structured topic correlations while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDA's Dirichlet prior cannot capture rich correlations and hierarchical relationships among topics that often exist in real-world data.

Method: Replace Dirichlet prior with arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree distribution, develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation with vectorized GPU-accelerated implementations.

Result: Framework substantially expands LDA's modeling capacity while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency through fully vectorized GPU implementations.

Conclusion: LDTA provides a more expressive generalization of LDA that can capture complex topic relationships while preserving computational tractability.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

### [419] [SGNO: Spectral Generator Neural Operators for Stable Long Horizon PDE Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18801)
*Jiayi Li,Zhaonan Wang,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGNO introduces a spectral generator neural operator with exponential time differencing and gated forcing to stabilize autoregressive rollouts in neural operator PDE surrogates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators often become unstable in short train long test settings due to error accumulation and high frequency feedback growth during autoregressive rollouts.

Method: SGNO uses exponential time differencing in Fourier space with learned diagonal generator (constrained to nonpositive real part) for linear dynamics, plus gated forcing term with channel mixing for nonlinear dynamics, with spectral truncation and smooth masking.

Result: SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines on APEBench across 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, with theoretical error bounds.

Conclusion: SGNO effectively addresses neural operator instability through spectral generator constraints and controlled nonlinear updates, enabling stable long-horizon PDE predictions.

Abstract: Neural operators provide fast PDE surrogates and often generalize across parameters and resolutions. However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.
  We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.
  We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines. Ablations confirm the roles of the generator constraint, gating, and filtering.The code is available at https://github.com/lijy32123-cloud/SGNO.

### [420] [Bayesian Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18825)
*Nicholas Kuhn,Arvid Weyrauch,Lars Heyen,Achim Streit,Markus Götz,Charlotte Debus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis holds in Bayesian neural networks, with sparse subnetworks achieving matching or surpassing accuracy compared to dense BNNs, though performance degrades at very high sparsities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian neural networks are valuable for uncertainty quantification but computationally expensive. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests sparse subnetworks can achieve similar performance with fewer resources. Investigating if LTH applies to BNNs could enable sparse training algorithms and provide insights into BNN training processes.

Method: Translated LTH experiments to Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. Investigated characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets and extended study to transplantation methods connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. Used magnitude-based pruning primarily, with standard deviation as secondary criterion.

Result: LTH generally holds in BNNs - winning tickets with matching or surpassing accuracy exist independent of model size, though degradation occurs at very high sparsities. Pruning should prioritize magnitude, then standard deviation. Models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees.

Conclusion: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis extends to Bayesian neural networks, enabling development of sparse training algorithms for BNNs and providing insights into their training dynamics. This can help reduce computational demands while maintaining uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a useful tool for uncertainty quantification, but require substantially more computational resources than conventional neural networks. For non-Bayesian networks, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of sparse subnetworks that can train to the same or even surpassing accuracy as the original dense network. Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities. However, the pruning strategy should rely primarily on magnitude, secondly on standard deviation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees.

*Samuel Fernández-Menduiña,Eduardo Pavez,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2G-Net is a novel spectral GNN that factorizes the graph Fourier transform into local subgraph operations combined via Cauchy matrices, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependencies without full eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral methods based on GFT are rarely used in GNNs due to computational cost of eigenbasis computation and lack of vertex-domain locality. Existing GNNs rely on local approximations (polynomial filters or message passing) that limit their ability to model long-range dependencies.

Method: Introduces a novel factorization of GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, combined via Cauchy matrices. L2G-Net processes spectral representations of subgraphs and combines them via structured matrices, avoiding full eigendecompositions with quadratic complexity in nodes scaled by subgraph interface size.

Result: Outperforms existing spectral techniques on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies, competitive with state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.

Conclusion: L2G-Net bridges the gap between fully global spectral methods and local approximations, providing an efficient spectral GNN that can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.

### [422] [Exact Attention Sensitivity and the Geometry of Transformer Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18849)
*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a stability theory for transformers, explaining architectural choices like pre-LayerNorm, DeepNorm scaling, and warmup through exact analysis of softmax Jacobian norms and block geometry, showing transformer stability comes from architecture not learned attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers power modern AI but remain mysteriously brittle to train. The paper aims to explain why certain architectural choices (pre-LayerNorm, DeepNorm scaling, warmup) work from first principles, moving beyond empirical observations to theoretical understanding.

Method: Develops a stability theory with two pillars: (1) Derives exact operator norm of softmax Jacobian with balanced-mass factor quantifying attention sensitivity; (2) Introduces block-∞/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation for Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Uses this framework to analyze gradient flow in transformer architectures.

Result: Proves pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially; shows DeepNorm's N^{-1/4} scaling emerges from quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices; validates on 774M-parameter models finding θ(p) ≈ 1 persists throughout training, indicating transformer stability arises from architectural gradient flow, not attention dynamics.

Conclusion: Transformer stability comes entirely from architectural gradient flow, not learned attention patterns. This changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns. Provides theoretical foundation for understanding and designing stable transformer architectures.

Abstract: Despite powering modern AI, transformers remain mysteriously brittle to train. We develop a stability theory that explains why pre-LayerNorm works, why DeepNorm uses $N^{-1/4}$ scaling, and why warmup is necessary, all from first principles. Our framework has two pillars: (1) We derive the \emph{exact} operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, $\|J_{softmax}(u/τ)\|_{\infty\to 1} = θ(p)/τ$, where the balanced-mass factor $θ(p)\in[0,1]$ quantifies attention sensitivity. (2) We introduce a block-$\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns.

### [423] [Rank-Aware Spectral Bounds on Attention Logits for Stable Low-Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18851)
*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a rank-aware concentration inequality for transformer attention scores, showing that when the attention interaction matrix has low rank r ≪ d, the maximum attention magnitude decays as exp(-d²α²/(γr)) rather than exp(-dα²). This leads to 8-28× tighter concentration bounds and enables geometry-aware scale factors for FP8 training that prevent overflows without observing activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-precision training (like FP8) in transformers faces overflow risks due to large attention scores. Existing methods use delayed scaling that observes activations, but this can fail in transient scenarios. The paper aims to provide principled overflow guarantees by understanding the statistical concentration properties of attention scores.

Method: 1) Derives a rank-aware concentration inequality showing that when attention interaction matrix M = W^Q W^{K⊤} has rank r ≪ d, tail probabilities decay faster. 2) Applies this to FP8 training by computing geometry-aware scale factors from spectral norm ||W^Q W^{K⊤}||₂ via implicit power iteration. 3) Includes grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion while remaining compatible with fused attention kernels.

Result: The rank-aware bound provides 8-28× tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. Geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy across models from GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B.

Conclusion: The rank-aware concentration inequality provides theoretical foundation for understanding attention score behavior. Geometry-aware scale factors offer a principled, activation-free method for overflow prevention in low-precision transformer training, with practical benefits across large-scale models.

Abstract: Attention scores in transformers are bilinear forms $S_{ij} = x_i^\top M x_j / \sqrt{d_h}$ whose maximum magnitude governs overflow risk in low-precision training. We derive a \emph{rank-aware concentration inequality}: when the interaction matrix $M = W^Q W^{K\top}$ has rank $r \ll d$, tail probabilities for $\max_{i,j}|S_{ij}|$ decay as $\exp(-d^{2}α^{2}/(γr))$ rather than $\exp(-dα^{2})$, where $γ> 1$ is a typicality parameter. For transformer attention where $r = d_h$, this yields $8$--$28\times$ tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. We apply this result to FP8 training, deriving \emph{geometry-aware scale factors} that provide principled overflow guarantees without observing activations. The method computes per-layer scales from the spectral norm $\|W^Q W^{K\top}\|_2$ via implicit power iteration, includes a grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion, and remains compatible with fused attention kernels. Across GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B, geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy.

*Reabetswe M. Nkhumise,Mohamed S. Talamali,Aditya Gilra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current RL task complexity metrics (PIC, POIC) based on Random Weight Guessing produce counterintuitive results that contradict robotic control knowledge and empirical RL evidence, highlighting the need for better non-tabular complexity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of reliable task complexity metrics for non-tabular RL domains, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. Existing metrics like PIC and POIC rely on Random Weight Guessing but their validity is questionable.

Method: The authors empirically evaluate existing complexity metrics (PIC and POIC) using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups with known relative complexity. They test both dense and sparse reward formulations in single-link and two-link robotic arm configurations.

Result: PIC suggests two-link robotic arm is easier than single-link setup, contradicting robotic control knowledge. POIC estimates sparse reward tasks are easier than dense reward tasks, contradicting empirical RL results. Both metrics produce counterintuitive findings.

Conclusion: Current RWG-based complexity metrics (PIC, POIC) are unreliable for non-tabular RL. The field needs to move beyond these metrics and develop better alternatives that can accurately capture task complexity, with the proposed task framework serving as a starting point.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled major advances in fields such as robotics and natural language processing. A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayes-optimal agents achieve optimal exploration-exploitation trade-off but are computationally intractable. Existing deep learning methods are still costly to train, requiring more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes VariBASeD: variational framework combining variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning for Bayes-adaptive MDPs.

Result: In single-GPU setup, VariBASeD shows favorable scaling to larger planning budgets and improves both sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed variational framework successfully accelerates learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive MDPs, making Bayes-optimal RL more practical with better computational efficiency.

Abstract: Optimally trading-off exploration and exploitation is the holy grail of reinforcement learning as it promises maximal data-efficiency for solving any task. Bayes-optimal agents achieve this, but obtaining the belief-state and performing planning are both typically intractable. Although deep learning methods can greatly help in scaling this computation, existing methods are still costly to train. To accelerate this, this paper proposes a variational framework for learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes that coalesces variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning. In a single-GPU setup, our new method VariBASeD exhibits favorable scaling to larger planning budgets, improving sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic spaces are naturally suited for hierarchical/tree-structured data due to exponential volume growth, but neural networks need intrinsic hyperbolic components to effectively leverage this geometry.

Method: Lift Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers to hyperbolic space using Busemann functions, creating Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with unified mathematical interpretation.

Result: Experiments on image classification, genome sequence learning, node classification, and link prediction show improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over prior hyperbolic layers.

Conclusion: The proposed Busemann-based hyperbolic layers provide compact parameters, intuitive geometric interpretation (point-to-horosphere distance), batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, offering practical advantages for hyperbolic neural networks.

Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical and tree-structured data due to their exponential volume growth. To leverage these benefits, neural networks require intrinsic and efficient components that operate directly in hyperbolic space. In this work, we lift two core components of neural networks, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers, into hyperbolic space via Busemann functions, resulting in Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with a unified mathematical interpretation. BMLR provides compact parameters, a point-to-horosphere distance interpretation, batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, while BFC generalizes FC and activation layers with comparable complexity.

*Jian Qian,Shu Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for boosting in structured prediction, defining (α,β)-boostability and showing geometric median aggregation achieves this property for various divergences, with applications to vector-valued and conditional density prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, there's incomplete theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses. The paper aims to provide a general theoretical framework for understanding how aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones in structured prediction settings.

Method: The authors formalize stability as (α,β)-boostability, analyze geometric median aggregation for various divergences (ℓ₁, ℓ₂, TV, Hellinger), and propose GeoMedBoost framework using exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. They characterize boostability regimes and handle KL divergence indirectly through Hellinger distance.

Result: Geometric median aggregation achieves (α,β)-boostability for broad divergence classes with dimension-dependent vs dimension-free tradeoffs. The GeoMedBoost framework yields exponential decay of empirical divergence exceedance error under weak learner conditions, recovering classical algorithms as special cases.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction, establishing theoretical foundations for aggregation in vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences, with practical algorithmic implications through the GeoMedBoost framework.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.

*Rajesh Rajagopalamenon,Unnikrishnan Cheramangalath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEHRGNN is a unified GNN model for n-ary relational knowledge graphs that handles both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges, outperforming specialized baselines on link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world knowledge bases contain complex n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges, requiring both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. Current research treats these n-ary fact types independently, lacking a unified approach.

Method: Proposes HEHRGNN with two main components: 1) HEHR unified fact representation format, and 2) HEHRGNN encoder - a GNN-based encoder with novel message propagation that captures complex graph structures with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges.

Result: HEHRGNN shows effectiveness as a unified embedding model for link prediction across real-world datasets with different n-ary fact types, demonstrating inductive prediction capability and improved performance over baseline models for both hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.

Conclusion: HEHRGNN provides a unified solution for n-ary relational knowledge graphs, successfully handling both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges while outperforming specialized models and showing practical applicability to real-world knowledge bases.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph(KG) has gained traction as a machine-readable organization of real-world knowledge for analytics using artificial intelligence systems. Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.

TL;DR: PCA-VAE replaces vector quantization with online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule, offering fully differentiable alternative to VQ-VAEs with better reconstruction, fewer bits, and interpretable dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector-quantized autoencoders have inherent flaws: non-differentiable quantizers requiring straight-through hacks, prone to collapse, and need codebooks/commitment losses. The authors seek a principled, mathematically grounded alternative.

Method: Replace VQ bottleneck with online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. This learns orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. The approach is fully differentiable and simpler than VQ-based methods.

Result: PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. Produces naturally interpretable dimensions (pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives.

Conclusion: PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured. Offers new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization with simpler, more principled approach.

Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUE framework provides multi-level verifiable explanations for LLM reasoning by integrating executable verification, feasible-region DAG modeling, and causal failure mode analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM explanation methods lack trustworthy structural insight, are limited to single-instance analysis, and fail to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms.

Method: TRUE integrates three components: 1) Executable reasoning verification with blind execution to assess operational validity; 2) Feasible-region DAG modeling via structure-consistent perturbations to characterize reasoning stability; 3) Causal failure mode analysis using Shapley values to identify recurring structural failure patterns.

Result: The framework provides multi-level explanations: executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at class level across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TRUE establishes a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems through verifiable multi-level explanations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet their decision-making processes remain difficult to interpret. Existing explanation methods often lack trustworthy structural insight and are limited to single-instance analysis, failing to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose the Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework (TRUE), which integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling, and causal failure mode analysis. At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level. These results establish a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems.

*Yangchen Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepInterestGR addresses the Shallow Interest problem in generative recommendation by extracting deep semantic interests from user interactions using multi-LLM mining, reward labeling, and interest-enhanced item discretization, achieving superior performance on Amazon benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation frameworks rely on shallow behavioral signals and surface-level textual features, failing to capture latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions. This "Shallow Interest problem" limits personalization depth and recommendation interpretability.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM) using frontier LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting to extract deep textual/visual interest representations; (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI) with binary classifier to assign reward labels for RL supervision; (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID) encoding deep interests into semantic embeddings quantized via RQ-VAE. Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO and Interest-Aware Reward.

Result: Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks show DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Conclusion: DeepInterestGR successfully addresses the Shallow Interest problem by capturing deep semantic interests through multi-LLM mining and reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior recommendation performance and providing a framework for more interpretable and personalized recommendations.

Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

*Alexey Kroshnin,Alexandra Suvorikova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP) framework for density-adaptive domain discretization under LDP without iterative privacy budget costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but challenging under LDP due to privacy-budget costs of iterative refinement.

Method: SLDP assigns privacy region to each user based on local density, defines adjacency by point movement within privacy region, and uses interactive (ε,δ)-SLDP protocol orchestrated by honest-but-curious server over public channel to estimate regions privately.

Result: Framework decouples privacy cost from number of refinement iterations, allowing high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. Experimental demonstration shows effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SLDP enables density-adaptive domain discretization under local differential privacy without the privacy budget constraints that limit iterative refinement approaches.

Abstract: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but remains challenging under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to the privacy-budget costs associated with iterative refinement. We propose a novel framework, Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP), that assigns a privacy region to each user based on local density and defines adjacency by the potential movement of a point within its privacy region. We present an interactive $(\varepsilon, δ)$-SLDP protocol, orchestrated by an honest-but-curious server over a public channel, to estimate these regions privately. Crucially, our framework decouples the privacy cost from the number of refinement iterations, allowing for high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. We experimentally demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to calibrate AI benchmarks against the world population using human-anchored scales with logarithmic probability levels, addressing misleading "human level" comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI model comparisons to "human level" are misleading because benchmark scores are incommensurate and human baselines come from narrow populations, lacking proper calibration to the entire world population.

Method: Build multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level represents a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with base B. Calibrate scales using publicly released human test data (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, ReliabilityBench). Estimate base B by extrapolating between demographic profiles using LLMs, which are hypothesized to condense rich information about human populations. Evaluate mappings using group slicing and post-stratification.

Result: Develops new techniques for recalibrating and standardizing scales relative to the whole-world population, enabling more meaningful AI-human comparisons on a common human-anchored scale.

Conclusion: The framework provides a solution to misleading AI-human comparisons by establishing properly calibrated scales anchored to world population performance, allowing for standardized assessment of AI capabilities relative to human populations.

Abstract: Comparing AI models to "human level" is often misleading when benchmark scores are incommensurate or human baselines are drawn from a narrow population. To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench). The base $B$ is estimated by extrapolating between samples with two demographic profiles using LLMs, with the hypothesis that they condense rich information about human populations. We evaluate the quality of different mappings using group slicing and post-stratification. The new techniques allow for the recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the whole-world population.

### [434] [LoMime: Query-Efficient Membership Inference using Model Extraction in Label-Only Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18934)
*Abdullah Caglar Oksuz,Anisa Halimi,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel label-only membership inference attack that uses model extraction to reduce query costs, achieving comparable accuracy with only 1% of training sample queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks have practical limitations: they require unrealistic assumptions (public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores) or suffer from high query costs per sample. Label-only MIAs under strict black-box constraints are particularly query-intensive, making them impractical for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes a transferability-based framework with three key components: 1) Active sampling to query the target model efficiently, 2) Perturbation-based selection to identify informative samples, and 3) Synthetic data generation to create training data for surrogate extraction. The method extracts a functionally similar surrogate model S from target model M, then performs membership inference on S instead of repeatedly querying M.

Result: Achieves membership inference accuracy within ±1% of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while reducing query costs dramatically. On Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital benchmarks, only 1% of training samples (query budget) suffices to extract surrogate S. The method operates under strict black-box constraints and maintains performance comparable to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed transferability-based model extraction approach enables cost-effective label-only membership inference attacks that circumvent the high query requirements of existing methods. The framework is robust to standard defenses designed for label-only MIAs and demonstrates practical feasibility for real-world privacy attacks on machine learning models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training. Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\approx1\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\pm1\%$ of M . We also evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses proposed for label-only MIAs against our attack.

*Sacchit Kale,Piyushi Manupriya,Pierre Marion,Francis bach,Anant Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient descent with increasing step sizes achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression without entering unstable regimes, showing instability is not necessary for acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work suggests acceleration often occurs near the "edge of stability" where optimization becomes unstable. The authors question whether instability is inherent to acceleration, aiming to show that stable optimization can also achieve exponential convergence.

Method: Proposes gradient descent with a simple non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule for separable logistic regression under margin condition. Also develops stochastic gradient descent with lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search.

Result: Proves exponential convergence for both gradient descent (with increasing step sizes) and stochastic gradient descent (with adaptive step sizes) for separable logistic regression, while remaining entirely within stable optimization regimes.

Conclusion: Carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration without requiring unstable regimes, demonstrating that instability is not inherent to acceleration in optimization.

Abstract: Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are central to modern machine learning, yet their behavior under large step sizes remains theoretically unclear. Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes symmetry reduction framework for Transformers to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom by reformulating representations, attention, and optimization in invariant relational terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries in model and head space. Existing approaches break symmetry, but this paper takes complementary approach.

Method: Reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This yields architectures operating directly on relational structures.

Result: Provides principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization in Transformer models through symmetry reduction rather than symmetry breaking.

Conclusion: Symmetry reduction offers complementary approach to existing symmetry-breaking methods, providing geometric framework to eliminate redundancy and analyze optimization in Transformers through invariant relational formulations.

Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.

TL;DR: Introduces Incremental TNP (incTNP) for efficient sequential inference, matching standard TNP performance while reducing update cost from quadratic to linear time via causal masking and KV caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs) lack efficient incremental update capabilities for sequential/streaming applications like real-time sensor data, requiring expensive recomputation from scratch for each new observation.

Method: Proposes incTNP using causal masking, Key-Value caching, and data-efficient autoregressive training to enable linear-time updates while maintaining predictive performance comparable to standard TNPs.

Result: incTNP achieves comparable or better performance than non-causal TNPs on synthetic and real-world tasks (tabular regression, temperature prediction) with orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference, while maintaining implicit Bayesian consistency.

Conclusion: incTNP successfully combines computational efficiency of causal masking with the consistency required for streaming inference, enabling practical deployment of TNPs in sequential applications without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

TL;DR: CoSiNE is a deep learning model that combines phylogenetic evolutionary dynamics with neural network expressivity to capture epistatic interactions in antibody affinity maturation, outperforming language models in variant effect prediction and enabling antibody optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for antibody engineering treat sequences as independent samples, ignoring the rich evolutionary information from affinity maturation. Classical phylogenetic models capture evolutionary dynamics but lack expressivity for complex epistatic interactions.

Method: CoSiNE (Continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network) provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process. It uses Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme for inference-time steering.

Result: Mathematically proven to capture epistatic effects with quadratic error bound in branch length. Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation.

Conclusion: CoSiNE bridges the gap between evolutionary dynamics modeling and deep learning expressivity, enabling more accurate antibody variant prediction and efficient optimization of binding affinity toward specific antigens.

Abstract: Common deep learning approaches for antibody engineering focus on modeling the marginal distribution of sequences. By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.

TL;DR: ERM with finite-precision hardware reveals sharp dichotomy: polynomial activation networks are #P-Hard, while piecewise-linear activations (ReLU) are NP-complete and tractable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard theoretical analyses of ERM use Real-RAM model, which diverges from reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. Need to analyze ERM under realistic bit-level model to understand true computational complexity.

Method: Analyze ERM under bit-level model (ERM_bit) where network parameters and inputs are constrained to rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Compare complexity for different activation functions.

Result: For polynomial activations (degree ≥ 2): ERM_bit is #P-Hard; computing partial derivatives is intractable; determining gradient bits is #P-Hard. For piecewise-linear activations (ReLU): ERM_bit is NP-complete; backpropagation runs in polynomial time.

Conclusion: Finite-precision constraints are fundamental determinants of learnability, not just implementation details. Activation function choice creates sharp tractability dichotomy: polynomial activations lead to severe computational complexity, while piecewise-linear activations remain manageable.

Abstract: Theoretical analyses of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are standardly framed within the Real-RAM model of computation. In this setting, training even simple neural networks is known to be $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete -- a complexity class believed to be harder than NP, that characterizes the difficulty of solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the real numbers. However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is $\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability.

TL;DR: ADRA introduces active data reconstruction attacks for membership inference, using RL to induce models to reconstruct training data, outperforming existing methods by 10.7% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current membership inference attacks (MIAs) are passive and operate on fixed model weights using log-likelihoods or text generations. The authors hypothesize that training data are more reconstructible than non-members, and this difference can be exploited through active reconstruction techniques.

Method: ADRA uses on-policy reinforcement learning to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. The authors design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards, creating two algorithms: ADRA and its adaptive variant ADRA+.

Result: The methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7% over previous runner-up. ADRA+ improves over Min-K%++ by 18.8% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6% on AIME for post-training detection.

Conclusion: Active data reconstruction attacks (ADRA) provide a more effective approach to membership inference by actively inducing models to reconstruct training data through RL-based techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various detection scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid generative AI + numerical optimization framework for inverse lithography that learns to propose multiple mask candidates, then refines them with fast ILT to escape poor local minima and improve mask quality and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse lithography suffers from highly non-convex objectives that trap optimization in poor local minima. Existing generative AI approaches train deterministic translators that mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement.

Method: Reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is pretrained with WGAN + reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, sample a batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics, and select the best candidate.

Result: On LithoBench dataset, reduces EPE violations under 3nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus strong numerical ILT baseline while improving final mask quality. Achieves over 20% EPE improvement on ICCAD13 contest cases with 3× speedup over SOTA numerical ILT solver.

Conclusion: By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, the approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve individually, demonstrating a successful hybrid framework for mask synthesis.

Abstract: Inverse lithography (ILT) is critical for modern semiconductor manufacturing but suffers from highly non-convex objectives that often trap optimization in poor local minima. Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "neural resonance" - a phenomenon where iterative feedback in AI training converges to low-dimensional invariant structures in latent space, explaining model collapse mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI training datasets increasingly contain AI-generated examples, creating feedback loops where one model's output impacts another's training. While iterative feedback is known to cause model collapse, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Method: Model iterative feedback as a Markov Chain and identify two conditions for neural resonance: ergodicity of feedback process and directional contraction of latent representation. Study diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, CycleGAN, and audio feedback experiments to analyze manifold geometry evolution.

Result: Identified neural resonance phenomenon where feedback processes converge to low-dimensional invariant structures. Developed an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors by mapping local and global manifold geometry evolution across different models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and offers practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating model collapse in feedback-driven training scenarios.

Abstract: AI training datasets will inevitably contain AI-generated examples, leading to ``feedback'' in which the output of one model impacts the training of another. It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse.

TL;DR: PROSPER is a new preference fine-tuning algorithm that handles intransitive (cyclic) preferences from multiple objectives without requiring scalarization, outperforming baselines in LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference fine-tuning assumes transitive preferences, but real-world preferences often become intransitive due to inconsistent rankings or multiple conflicting objectives. This breaks the assumption of a well-defined optimal policy in PFT pipelines.

Method: Proposes Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner (MaxEntBW) as a game-theoretic solution concept for multi-objective intransitive preferences. Derives PROSPER algorithm for efficient computation at scale, which directly handles multiple objectives without scalarization.

Result: PROSPER outperforms all baselines across instruction following and general chat benchmarks when fine-tuning LLMs from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback. Releases trained model checkpoints at 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Conclusion: PROSPER provides an effective solution for preference fine-tuning with intransitive preferences, particularly valuable for multi-objective LLM fine-tuning where both sources of intransitivity naturally occur.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in preference fine-tuning (PFT) is handling $\textit{intransitive}$ (i.e., cyclic) preferences. Intransitive preferences often stem from either $\textit{(i)}$ inconsistent rankings along a single objective or $\textit{(ii)}$ scalarizing multiple objectives into a single metric. Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm. Unlike prior self-play techniques, $\texttt{PROSPER}$ directly handles multiple objectives without requiring scalarization. We then apply $\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise. We find that $\texttt{PROSPER}$ outperforms all baselines considered across both instruction following and general chat benchmarks, releasing trained model checkpoints at the 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDLM extends inverse distillation to discrete diffusion language models, achieving 4x-64x faster inference while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have strong text generation capabilities but suffer from slow inference due to multi-step sampling, limiting practical applications.

Method: Extends inverse distillation from continuous to discrete diffusion models, provides theoretical uniqueness guarantees, and introduces gradient-stable relaxations for effective training.

Result: IDLM reduces inference steps by 4x-64x across multiple DLMs while preserving teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully accelerates discrete diffusion language models through theoretically-grounded inverse distillation with practical training solutions.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved strong results in text generation. However, their multi-step sampling leads to slow inference, limiting practical use. To address this, we extend Inverse Distillation, a technique originally developed to accelerate continuous diffusion models, to the discrete setting. Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization. We then introduce gradient-stable relaxations to support effective training. As a result, experiments on multiple DLMs show that our method, Inverse-distilled Diffusion Language Models (IDLM), reduces the number of inference steps by 4x-64x, while preserving the teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

### [445] [TimeRadar: A Domain-Rotatable Foundation Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19068)
*Hui He,Hezhe Qiao,Yutong Chen,Kun Yi,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRadar is a time series foundation model for anomaly detection that uses fractional time-frequency domain rotation to better differentiate normal and abnormal patterns across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series foundation models focus on learning regular patterns for supervised tasks like forecasting, making them ineffective for unsupervised anomaly detection where abnormal patterns can closely resemble normal ones in standard time/frequency domains.

Method: Introduces TimeRadar with two key components: 1) Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon) that uses a learnable fractional order to rotate time series to an optimal time-frequency domain for data reconstruction, and 2) Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) to model local deviations relative to contextual data in the rotatable domain.

Result: The method enables effective differentiation of abnormal patterns from regular ones across diverse datasets, including unseen datasets, by adaptively finding the most pronounced angle between time and frequency domains for each data input.

Conclusion: TimeRadar addresses the limitation of current TSFMs for anomaly detection by operating in a fractional time-frequency domain, providing adaptive data reconstruction and local deviation modeling to support generalist time series anomaly detection across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.

*Alejandro Parada-Mayorga,Alejandro Ribeiro,Juan Bazerque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a theory connecting integral operators to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), showing that integral operators induce RKHS convolutional signal models with box product kernels, enabling pointwise filter representations and novel connections between spectral and spatial domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integral operators are fundamental in signal processing but their connection to RKHS hasn't been systematically explored within algebraic signal processing. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive theory linking integral operators to RKHS representations.

Method: Develops a theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models. Characterizes algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS, showing polynomial filtering corresponds to iterated box products, creating a unital kernel algebra. Uses reproducing property for pointwise RKHS representations of filters.

Result: Establishes precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing. Extends naturally to directed graphons and enables novel spatial-spectral localization results. Shows optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations when spectral domain is a subset of signal domain.

Conclusion: The RKHS perspective provides an alternative to operator-based implementations, yields pointwise filter representations, and offers a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures, bridging spectral decompositions with kernel methods.

Abstract: Integral operators play a central role in signal processing, underpinning classical convolution, and filtering on continuous network models such as graphons. While these operators are traditionally analyzed through spectral decompositions, their connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) has not been systematically explored within the algebraic signal processing framework. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models whose reproducing kernels are determined by a box product of the operator symbols. We characterize the algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS and show that polynomial filtering with integral operators corresponds to iterated box products, giving rise to a unital kernel algebra. This perspective yields pointwise RKHS representations of filters via the reproducing property, providing an alternative to operator-based implementations. Our results establish precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing, extend naturally to directed graphons, and enable novel spatial--spectral localization results. Furthermore, we show that when the spectral domain is a subset of the original domain of the signals, optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations, providing a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures.

### [447] [The Power of Decaying Steps: Enhancing Attack Stability and Transferability for Sign-based Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19096)
*Wei Tao,Yang Dai,Jincai Huang,Qing Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDCS (Monotonically Decreasing Coordinate-wise Step-sizes) for sign-based adversarial attacks to address non-convergence and instability issues, improving transferability and providing theoretical convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sign-based adversarial attack methods like I-FGSM and MI-FGSM suffer from non-convergence and instability problems, which degrade attack success rates when more iterations are used and negatively impact transferability.

Method: Reformulate sign-based optimizers as coordinate-wise gradient descent, identify non-decaying step-size scheduling as a key issue, and propose MDCS (Monotonically Decreasing Coordinate-wise Step-sizes) algorithms that enforce monotonically decreasing step sizes for each coordinate.

Result: MDCS-MI achieves optimal convergence rate of O(1/√T), significantly improves transferability on image classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks, and enhances attack stability compared to state-of-the-art sign-based methods.

Conclusion: Addressing step-size scheduling from an optimization perspective effectively solves non-convergence and instability issues in sign-based adversarial attacks, leading to improved transferability and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Crafting adversarial examples can be formulated as an optimization problem. While sign-based optimizers such as I-FGSM and MI-FGSM have become the de facto standard for the induced optimization problems, there still exist several unsolved problems in theoretical grounding and practical reliability especially in non-convergence and instability, which inevitably influences their transferability. Contrary to the expectation, we observe that the attack success rate may degrade sharply when more number of iterations are conducted. In this paper, we address these issues from an optimization perspective. By reformulating the sign-based optimizer as a specific coordinate-wise gradient descent, we argue that one cause for non-convergence and instability is their non-decaying step-size scheduling. Based upon this viewpoint, we propose a series of new attack algorithms that enforce Monotonically Decreasing Coordinate-wise Step-sizes (MDCS) within sign-based optimizers. Typically, we further provide theoretical guarantees proving that MDCS-MI attains an optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Extensive experiments on image classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves transferability but also enhances attack stability compared to state-of-the-art sign-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One MIMO Q Network for offline RL to address extrapolation error from OOD data, balancing precision, speed, and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces extrapolation error from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods are either too conservative with OOD data, have imprecise OOD characterization, or have high computational overhead.

Method: Introduces Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One MIMO Q Network that quantifies data uncertainty and uses it in training losses to maximize lower confidence bound of Q-function. Uses Rank-One MIMO architecture for uncertainty quantification at near-single-network cost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmark while remaining computationally efficient. Strikes balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers promising approach to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance offline RL efficiency through uncertainty quantification with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest due to its safe and easily scalable paradigm. However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-Prune is a dynamic sample pruning method for spatio-temporal forecasting that accelerates training by focusing on informative samples based on real-time learning state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models on massive spatio-temporal datasets is computationally expensive. Existing approaches optimize model architectures or optimizers but overlook data inefficiency, wasting resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples during each epoch.

Method: ST-Prune uses dynamic sample pruning to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, rather than iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show ST-Prune significantly accelerates training speed while maintaining or even improving model performance, with demonstrated scalability and universality.

Conclusion: ST-Prune offers an effective training-efficiency technique for spatio-temporal forecasting by addressing data inefficiency through dynamic sample pruning, providing faster convergence without compromising performance.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.

*Michele Caprio,Katerina Papagiannouli,Siu Lun Chau,Sayan Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust Bayesian random feature regression with contamination sets for prior/likelihood misspecification, yielding tractable uncertainty bounds and improved predictive guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Bayesian RF regression assumes Gaussian priors/likelihoods, which are misspecified in practice. Need robust formulation that accounts for prior and likelihood misspecification while maintaining computational tractability.

Method: Replace single Gaussian prior/likelihood with ε- and η-contaminated credal sets, use pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. Derive explicit bounds for posterior predictive densities, introduce Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Obtain tractable predictive uncertainty bounds that preserve double-descent phase structure. Show contamination effectively acts as direct contamination of posterior predictive distribution. Provide efficient outer approximation via adjusted Gaussian credible intervals.

Conclusion: Establishes robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits classical asymptotic properties, and provides worst-case guarantees under bounded misspecification.

Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.

*Frida Jørgensen,Nina Weng,Siavash Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Influence functions can detect labeling bias by identifying mislabeled training samples through gradient and Hessian analysis, showing promising results on MNIST (90% detection) and CheXpert datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling bias occurs during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, causing unequal label error rates across subgroups. Most fairness constraints assume accurate training labels, making them ineffective when labeling bias exists. The paper investigates whether influence functions can detect such labeling bias.

Method: Developed a sample valuation pipeline using influence functions that estimate how each training sample affects model predictions by leveraging gradient and Hessian of the loss function. Tested on MNIST dataset first, then scaled to CheXpert medical imaging dataset. Introduced controlled label errors by flipping 20% of labels for one class to examine label noise detection.

Result: Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, achieved promising results: successfully detected nearly 90% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibited higher influence scores, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across different dataset complexities.

Conclusion: Influence functions show strong potential for identifying labeling bias and detecting mislabeled samples in training datasets. The method works across different domains (simple MNIST to complex medical imaging) and can help address fairness issues caused by labeling errors.

Abstract: Labeling bias arises during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, leading to unequal label error rates across subgroups or misrepresentation of subgroup prevalence. Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple normalized optimizer architecture with augmented meta-training enables efficient learning of general-purpose optimization rules that scale to billion-parameter tasks with only 4.5 GPU hours, outperforming previous methods requiring thousands of TPU months.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned optimizers have shown promise but face practical adoption barriers due to poor meta-generalization beyond training distributions and extremely high meta-training costs. Previous work like VeLO required massive compute (4,000 TPU months) but still failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters.

Method: Developed a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmented meta-training approach that enables efficient meta-training. The method is compatible with modern optimization techniques including orthogonalization, distinct update rules for different weight types, and decoupled weight decay.

Result: Achieved stable scaling to billion-parameter pretraining (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) - six orders of magnitude larger than meta-training distribution. The learned optimizer shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks with only 4.5 GPU hours of meta-training compute (vs. 4,000 TPU months for VeLO).

Conclusion: This work enables practical application of learned optimization algorithms and opens the door for exploring richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve optimizer performance.

Abstract: Learned optimizers are powerful alternatives to hand-designed update rules like Adam, yet they have seen limited practical adoption since they often fail to meta-generalize beyond their training distribution and incur high meta-training cost. For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\sim$10$\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance.

TL;DR: Transformers learn high-order Markov chains incrementally through staged sparse attention patterns, shifting from competitive to cooperative dynamics, climbing a complexity ladder through simpler hypotheses before reaching full model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance, and to investigate the staged learning dynamics and emergence of complex behaviors in transformer architectures.

Method: Introduce a high-order Markov chain task, analyze transformer learning through sparse attention patterns, model dynamics with simplified differential equations, prove stage-wise convergence results, and examine early stopping as implicit regularization.

Result: Transformers learn incrementally with distinct stages defined by specific sparse attention patterns, shifting from competitive (heads converging on dominant patterns) to cooperative (heads specializing in distinct patterns) dynamics, climbing a complexity ladder through simpler hypothesis classes.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundation for staged learning in transformers, showing they progress through simpler misspecified classes before reaching full capacity, with early stopping acting as implicit regularization, offering insights for NLP and algorithmic reasoning generalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.

Motivation: To enable test-time adaptation of frozen transformer models without persistent parameter updates, unlike static fine-tuning methods like LoRA that require learning and storing adapter parameters.

Method: Constructs activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where U and V are built from batch activation statistics and optional gradients.

Conclusion: VPS enables dynamic, inference-time adaptation of frozen transformers through activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations, offering a parameter-efficient alternative to static fine-tuning methods with potential reasoning enhancement benefits.

Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models.

### [456] [Online Realizable Regression and Applications for ReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19172)
*Ilan Doron-Arad,Idan Mehalel,Elchanan Mossel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that realizable online regression with approximate pseudo-metric losses can achieve horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss, characterized by a Dudley-type entropy integral of covering numbers, unlike classification which may have infinite mistake bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realizable online regression behaves differently from classification - even without margin/stochastic assumptions, realizability can enforce finite cumulative loss for metric-like losses while analogous classification problems have infinite mistake bounds. The existing characterization using scaled Littlestone dimension (𝔻_onl) is difficult to analyze.

Method: Develops a generic potential method that upper bounds 𝔻_onl by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral based on covering numbers. Defines entropy potential Φ(ℋ)=∫₀^{diam(ℋ)} log N(ℋ,ε) dε, where N(ℋ,ε) is ε-covering number, and proves 𝔻_onl(ℋ) ≤ O(c)Φ(ℋ) for c-approximate pseudo-metric losses.

Result: Shows polynomial metric entropy implies Φ(ℋ)<∞, giving horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bounds. Proves sharp q-vs-d dichotomy: finite Θ_{d,q}(L^d) total loss for L-Lipschitz regression iff q>d. For bounded-norm k-ReLU networks, regression has finite loss (even Õ(k²), O(1) for one ReLU) while classification is impossible for k=2,d=1.

Conclusion: The entropy potential method provides transparent, computable bounds for realizable online regression via covering numbers, revealing fundamental differences from classification and enabling analysis of complex hypothesis classes like ReLU networks.

Abstract: Realizable online regression can behave very differently from online classification. Even without any margin or stochastic assumptions, realizability may enforce horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss under metric-like losses, even when the analogous classification problem has an infinite mistake bound. We study realizable online regression in the adversarial model under losses that satisfy an approximate triangle inequality (approximate pseudo-metrics). Recent work of Attias et al. shows that the minimax realizable cumulative loss is characterized by the scaled Littlestone/online dimension $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$, but this quantity can be difficult to analyze.
  Our main contribution is a generic potential method that upper bounds $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$ by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral that depends only on covering numbers of the hypothesis class under the induced sup pseudo-metric. We define an \emph{entropy potential} $Φ(\mathcal{H})=\int_{0}^{diam(\mathcal{H})} \log N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon$, where $N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)$ is the $\varepsilon$-covering number of $\mathcal{H}$, and show that for every $c$-approximate pseudo-metric loss, $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}(\mathcal{H})\le O(c)\,Φ(\mathcal{H})$. In particular, polynomial metric entropy implies $Φ(\mathcal{H})<\infty$ and hence a horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bound with transparent dependence on effective dimension.
  We illustrate the method on two families. We prove a sharp $q$-vs.-$d$ dichotomy for realizable online learning (finite and efficiently achievable $Θ_{d,q}(L^d)$ total loss for $L$-Lipschitz regression iff $q>d$, otherwise infinite), and for bounded-norm $k$-ReLU networks separate regression (finite loss, even $\widetilde O(k^2)$, and $O(1)$ for one ReLU) from classification (impossible already for $k=2,d=1$).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for generating training data via symbolic problem space modifications with adaptive difficulty adjustment to improve small language models on mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data generation approaches have limitations: they use open-loop pipelines with fixed modifications that don't adapt to model capabilities, and they operate directly on word problems, limiting control over problem structure.

Method: Represent problems in symbolic space (using algebraic frameworks like SymPy or SMT formulations) as sets of variables and constraints. This enables precise structure control, automatic ground-truth solution generation, and decouples math reasoning from linguistic realization. Introduce closed-loop framework that learns modification strategies through prompt optimization in symbolic space to adapt problem difficulty to model capabilities.

Result: The symbolic representation results in more diverse generations. Experimental results show that both adaptive problem generation and symbolic representation modifications contribute to improving the model's math solving ability.

Conclusion: Symbolic problem space representation with adaptive difficulty adjustment through closed-loop prompt optimization is an effective approach for generating training data to improve small language models on mathematical tasks.

Abstract: We present a method for generating training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to improve small open-weights language models on mathematical tasks. Existing data generation approaches rely on open-loop pipelines and fixed modifications that do not adapt to the model's capabilities. Furthermore, they typically operate directly on word problems, limiting control over problem structure. To address this, we perform modifications in a symbolic problem space, representing each problem as a set of symbolic variables and constraints (e.g., via algebraic frameworks such as SymPy or SMT formulations). This representation enables precise control over problem structure, automatic generation of ground-truth solutions, and decouples mathematical reasoning from linguistic realization. We also show that this results in more diverse generations. To adapt the problem difficulty to the model, we introduce a closed-loop framework that learns modification strategies through prompt optimization in symbolic space. Experimental results demonstrate that both adaptive problem generation and symbolic representation modifications contribute to improving the model's math solving ability.

*Afsana Khan,Marijn ten Thij,Guangzhi Tang,Anna Wilbik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HybridFL combines horizontal and vertical federated learning for complex real-world data distributions, achieving strong performance in financial crime detection while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has complex hybrid distributions (both horizontal across users and vertical across features), but standard FL only handles one type of partition. Financial crime detection scenarios involve multiple parties with complementary data (transaction-level vs account-level features) that need collaborative learning without sharing raw data.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) architecture that integrates horizontal aggregation (across disjoint users) and vertical feature fusion (across complementary feature sets). The approach enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality through a federated framework.

Result: Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets show HybridFL significantly outperforms transaction-only local models and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark, demonstrating effective learning from distributed hybrid data.

Conclusion: HybridFL successfully addresses complex hybrid data distributions in federated learning, enabling privacy-preserving collaborative learning across parties with horizontally and vertically partitioned data, with promising applications in financial crime detection.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models on privately owned data without sharing raw information. While standard FL typically addresses either horizontal or vertical data partitions, many real-world scenarios exhibit a complex hybrid distribution. This paper proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) to address data split both horizontally across disjoint users and vertically across complementary feature sets. We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality. Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets demonstrate that HybridFL significantly outperforms the transaction-only local model and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark.

*Yangyi Fang,Jiaye Lin,Xiaoliang Fu,Cong Qin,Haolin Shi,Chaowen Hu,Lu Pan,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaMO is a dual-level optimization framework for RLVR that addresses gradient variance heterogeneity and policy optimization dynamics through variance-minimizing sequence allocation and gradient-aware advantage modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods face two key challenges: (1) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across different problems, and (2) softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training.

Method: DynaMO is a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged framework: (1) At sequence level, proves uniform allocation is suboptimal and derives variance-minimizing allocation using Bernoulli variance as proxy for gradient informativeness; (2) At token level, develops gradient-aware advantage modulation based on theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds, compensating for gradient attenuation while using entropy changes as indicators to stabilize excessive updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines.

Conclusion: DynaMO provides a theoretically-grounded solution to key challenges in RLVR optimization, improving both resource allocation efficiency and training stability through principled gradient variance management and advantage modulation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, yet current methods face key challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization dynamics: (i) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across problems, and (ii) the softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions, while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training. Therefore, we propose DynaMO, a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged optimization framework. At the sequence level, we prove that uniform allocation is suboptimal and derive variance-minimizing allocation from the first principle, establishing Bernoulli variance as a computable proxy for gradient informativeness. At the token level, we develop gradient-aware advantage modulation grounded in theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds. Our framework compensates for gradient attenuation of high-confidence correct actions while utilizing entropy changes as computable indicators to stabilize excessive update magnitudes. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines.

### [460] [Understanding Empirical Unlearning with Combinatorial Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19215)
*Shingo Kodama,Niv Cohen,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines whether unlearning methods truly remove knowledge from neural networks or just suppress its expression, using combinatorial interpretability to directly inspect model weights in a fully interpretable setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods often fail to completely erase knowledge from pretrained models, with supposedly removed knowledge persisting and being recoverable. Understanding this persistence is challenging due to the black-box nature of large foundation models.

Method: Use combinatorial interpretability framework for two-layer neural networks to directly inspect model weights. Reproduce baseline unlearning methods in this interpretable setting and analyze them along two dimensions: whether they truly remove target concepts or just inhibit expression, and how easily erased knowledge can be recovered through fine-tuning.

Result: The study provides insights into how knowledge persists despite unlearning attempts and reveals conditions under which supposedly erased knowledge can resurface, offering a clearer understanding of unlearning mechanisms in a fully interpretable environment.

Conclusion: Combinatorial interpretability enables direct examination of unlearning effectiveness, revealing that many methods merely suppress knowledge expression rather than truly removing it, with the underlying information remaining recoverable through various operations.

Abstract: While many recent methods aim to unlearn or remove knowledge from pretrained models, seemingly erased knowledge often persists and can be recovered in various ways. Because large foundation models are far from interpretable, understanding whether and how such knowledge persists remains a significant challenge. To address this, we turn to the recently developed framework of combinatorial interpretability. This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations. Our results shed light within a fully interpretable setting on how knowledge can persist despite unlearning and when it might resurface.

### [461] [Evaluating SAP RPT-1 for Enterprise Business Process Prediction: In-Context Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning on Structured SAP Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19237)
*Amit Lal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPT-1, SAP's 64.6MB tabular foundation model pretrained on 1.34TB of structured data, achieves 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without training examples, with a crossover point at 75-100 rows where it outperforms XGBoost in limited data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide the first independent evaluation of SAP's RPT-1 tabular foundation model from a practitioner perspective, assessing its viability as an alternative to traditional tuned gradient-boosted decision trees for enterprise machine learning without task-specific training.

Method: Benchmarked RPT-1 against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios using five-fold cross-validation on datasets of 2,500-3,200 rows. Evaluated demand forecasting (SD/MM/PP), predictive data integrity (BC/MM/QM), and financial risk classification (FI/CO/AR).

Result: RPT-1 achieves 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without training examples. Classification gap: 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC. Regression gap: 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. Found crossover at 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 outperforms XGBoost under limited data.

Conclusion: Proposes practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. RPT-1 shows promise as a zero-shot tabular foundation model, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models aim to make machine learning accessible for enterprise data without task-specific training. This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. All experiments are reproducible through publicly available Hugging Face Spaces.

*Qusai Khaled,Uzay Kaymak,Laura Genga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-ANFIS: A bi-objective gradient optimization method for explainable fuzzy systems that balances accuracy and explainability without expensive multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzy systems offer explainable AI potential but face accuracy-explainability trade-offs. Existing methods use computationally expensive evolutionary multi-objective optimization or gradient-based scalarization that misses non-convex Pareto regions.

Method: X-ANFIS uses alternating bi-objective gradient optimization with Cauchy membership functions for stable training and differentiable explainability objective decoupled from performance objective through alternating gradient passes.

Result: Validated on 9 UCI regression datasets with ~5,000 experiments, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of MOO Pareto front.

Conclusion: X-ANFIS provides an effective gradient-based approach for explainable fuzzy systems that balances accuracy and explainability better than existing methods, finding solutions in non-convex Pareto regions.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems show strong potential in explainable AI due to their rule-based architecture and linguistic variables. Existing approaches navigate the accuracy-explainability trade-off either through evolutionary multi-objective optimization (MOO), which is computationally expensive, or gradient-based scalarization, which cannot recover non-convex Pareto regions. We propose X-ANFIS, an alternating bi-objective gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Cauchy membership functions are used for stable training under semantically controlled initializations, and a differentiable explainability objective is introduced and decoupled from the performance objective through alternating gradient passes. Validated in approximately 5,000 experiments on nine UCI regression datasets, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of the MOO Pareto front.

*Aleksei Liuliakov,Luca Hermes,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGPO extends RL fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for neural architecture search, achieving near-oracle performance with transferable structural priors and genuine reward-driven steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion methods are designed for undirected structures and discard directional information in DAGs, which is crucial for neural architectures where edge direction encodes functional semantics like data flow. This limitation prevents effective application of RL fine-tuning to combinatorial structure generation for NAS.

Method: Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO) extends RL fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs using topological node ordering and positional encoding to preserve directional information. The method learns transferable structural priors through pretraining on limited data and fine-tuning with reward signals.

Result: DGPO matches benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). With only 7% pretraining data, it generates near-oracle architectures within 0.32 percentage points of full-data model and extrapolates 7.3 percentage points beyond training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments show genuine reward-driven steering with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%).

Conclusion: RL-steered discrete diffusion, when extended to handle directionality through DGPO, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures, enabling effective neural architecture search with transferable structural priors and genuine reward-driven optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning has proven effective for steering generative diffusion models toward desired properties in image and molecular domains. Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.

*Siavash Khodakarami,Vivek Oommen,Nazanin Ahmadi Daryakenari,Maxim Beekenkamp,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral bias in neural PDE solvers is not just a representational limitation but a dynamical phenomenon influenced by optimization methods, loss design, and architecture choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While spectral bias (preferential learning of low-frequency components) is known in neural PDE solvers like PINNs and neural operators, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to effectively address this fundamental limitation.

Method: Systematic investigation using frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments across diverse PDE types (elliptic, hyperbolic, dispersive). Benchmark problems include Korteweg-de Vries, wave equations, diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow, and earthquake dynamics.

Result: Second-order optimization methods substantially alter spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes. For neural operators, spectral bias depends on architecture and can be mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing inference cost.

Conclusion: Spectral bias is fundamentally dynamical rather than purely representational, and can be effectively addressed through optimization strategy selection, architecture design, and spectral-aware loss formulations across various PDE learning frameworks.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by neural networks as well as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), physics-informed KANs (PIKANs), and neural operators, are known to exhibit spectral bias, whereby low-frequency components of the solution are learned significantly faster than high-frequency modes. While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost.

*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Hongying Liu,Jin Liu,Weixin An,Yuanyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPAC addresses preconditioner drift in federated second-order optimization by aligning client geometries and correcting updates, improving stability and accuracy on non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order optimizers accelerate training but their federated variants are unstable on non-IID data due to preconditioner drift - heterogeneous client geometries cause incompatible metrics during server aggregation, corrupting global descent direction.

Method: FedPAC decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization through: (1) Alignment - aggregating local preconditioners into global reference and warm-starting clients; (2) Correction - steering local preconditioned updates using global preconditioned direction to suppress long-term drift.

Result: Provides drift-coupled non-convex convergence guarantees with linear speedup under partial participation. Empirically improves stability and accuracy across vision/language tasks, achieving up to 5.8% absolute accuracy gain on CIFAR-100 with ViTs.

Conclusion: FedPAC's preconditioner alignment and correction framework enables reliable federated second-order optimization by addressing geometric mismatch, making second-order methods viable for federated learning with non-IID data.

Abstract: Second-order optimizers can significantly accelerate large-scale training, yet their naive federated variants are often unstable or even diverge on non-IID data.
  We show that a key culprit is \emph{preconditioner drift}: client-side second-order training induces heterogeneous \emph{curvature-defined geometries} (i.e., preconditioner coordinate systems), and server-side model averaging updates computed under incompatible metrics, corrupting the global descent direction.
  To address this geometric mismatch, we propose \texttt{FedPAC}, a \emph{preconditioner alignment and correction} framework for reliable federated second-order optimization.
  \texttt{FedPAC} explicitly decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization by:
  (i) \textbf{Alignment} (i.e.,aggregating local preconditioners into a global reference and warm-starting clients via global preconditioner); and
  (ii) \textbf{Correction} (i.e., steering local preconditioned updates using a global preconditioned direction to suppress long-term drift).
  We provide drift-coupled non-convex convergence guarantees with linear speedup under partial participation.
  Empirically, \texttt{FedPAC} consistently improves stability and accuracy across vision and language tasks, achieving up to $5.8\%$ absolute accuracy gain on CIFAR-100 with ViTs.

*Jiangjie Qiu,Wentao Li,Honghao Chen,Leyi Zhao,Xiaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdsorbFlow is a deterministic generative model for adsorbate placement that uses conditional flow matching to achieve higher accuracy with 20x fewer steps than diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces are computationally expensive, requiring ~100 iterative steps per sample with diffusion models, creating a bottleneck in computational heterogeneous catalysis.

Method: AdsorbFlow learns an energy-conditioned vector field on rigid-body configuration space using conditional flow matching with classifier-free guidance (not energy-gradient guidance), reducing sampling to integrating an ODE in as few as 5 steps.

Result: Achieves 61.4% SR@10 and 34.1% SR@1 on OC20-Dense, surpassing AdsorbDiff (31.8% SR@1, 41.0% SR@10) and AdsorbML (47.7% SR@10) with 20x fewer steps and lowest anomaly rate (6.8%). Maintains 58.0% SR@10 on out-of-distribution systems.

Conclusion: Deterministic transport (flow matching) is both faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach for computational heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract: Identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces is a practical bottleneck for computational heterogeneous catalysis: the difficulty lies not only in the cost of density functional theory (DFT) but in proposing initial placements that relax into the correct energy basins. Conditional denoising diffusion has improved success rates, yet requires $\sim$100 iterative steps per sample.
  Here we introduce AdsorbFlow, a deterministic generative model that learns an energy-conditioned vector field on the rigid-body configuration space of adsorbate translation and rotation via conditional flow matching. Energy information enters through classifier-free guidance conditioning -- not energy-gradient guidance -- and sampling reduces to integrating an ODE in as few as 5 steps.
  On OC20-Dense with full DFT single-point verification, AdsorbFlow with an EquiformerV2 backbone achieves 61.4% SR@10 and 34.1% SR@1 -- surpassing AdsorbDiff (31.8% SR@1, 41.0% SR@10) at every evaluation level and AdsorbML (47.7% SR@10) -- while using 20 times fewer generative steps and achieving the lowest anomaly rate among generative methods (6.8%). On 50 out-of-distribution systems, AdsorbFlow retains 58.0% SR@10 with a MLFF-to-DFT gap of only 4~percentage points. These results establish that deterministic transport is both faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), an off-policy RL objective that uses soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights to improve policy exploration while maintaining training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LLM alignment research focuses on GRPO-based methods with two directions: sequence-level importance sampling for better alignment with sequence-level rewards, and alternatives to PPO-style clipping to avoid training signal loss and entropy collapse. The paper aims to build on recent advances like SAPO and GMPO to create a more effective policy optimization approach.

Method: Introduces Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights. This approach combines sequence coherence with token adaptivity while promoting effective policy exploration.

Result: The paper proposes a new objective but doesn't present experimental results in the abstract. The method is positioned as building on recent advances like SAPO and GMPO to address limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: SSPO represents a novel approach to LLM alignment that aims to balance effective policy exploration with training stability by incorporating soft gating mechanisms within the GRPO framework, addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

*Barsat Khadka,Kawsher Roxy,Md Rubel Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTS-Bench is a benchmark suite for evaluating graph coarsening trade-offs in GNN-based Clock Tree Synthesis analysis, showing that while coarsening improves efficiency, it harms accuracy for CTS-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs show promise for physical design analysis in EDA, but practical deployment is limited by the high computational cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is used for scalability, but its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well understood.

Method: The paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite with 4,860 converged physical design solutions across five architectures, providing paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations. It uses clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task to systematically evaluate trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Result: Graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, but removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative R² scores under zero-shot evaluation. Generic graph clustering techniques fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives even when global physical metrics remain unchanged.

Conclusion: CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

*Chaitanya Kapoor,Alex H. Williams,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partial soft-matching distance extends optimal transport to allow unmatched neurons, improving robustness to noise and outliers in neural representational comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard representational similarity metrics force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations.

Method: Extend soft-matching distance to partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences with efficient neuron ranking.

Result: Preserves correct matches under outliers, reliably selects correct models in noise-corrupted tasks, excludes low-reliability voxels in fMRI, achieves higher alignment precision than standard methods, and enables identification of matched vs. unmatched units in deep networks.

Conclusion: Partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence, enabling focused analyses and robust alignment quality assessment.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.

*Rishabh Bhattacharya,Vikaskumar Kalsariya,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-GRAMA enables training-free merging of heterogeneous GNN architectures by lifting merging from parameter space to operator space, allowing cross-architecture combinations like GCN to GAT without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging methods are limited to homogeneous architectures, but GNNs have topology-dependent message passing that makes parameter-space merging unreliable for heterogeneous GNNs.

Method: Introduces H-GRAMA framework with Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM) - a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language, enabling training-free merging in operator space.

Result: Enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retains high specialist accuracy in most compatible depth settings, and achieves inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

Conclusion: H-GRAMA bridges the gap for heterogeneous GNN merging by operating in operator space rather than parameter space, providing a practical solution for combining expert GNN models with different architectures.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

*Egor Denisov,Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO improves LLM reasoning but suffers from instability due to hard clipping. SAPO replaces clipping with sigmoid gates for stability. This paper investigates different gate functions' impact on stability and performance, formalizing properties for admissible gates and testing them on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for math reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GRPO advances LLM training and reasoning, its hard clipping causes instability. SAPO's sigmoid-based approach improves stability, but the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance remains unexplored.

Method: Formalized key properties for admissible gate functions, identified several families of such functions, and empirically evaluated them using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Result: The analysis provides findings on how different gate functions affect training stability and model performance, offering practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of gate functions in policy optimization, providing empirical evidence and design principles for more stable and effective LLM training objectives.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the training of large language models and enhanced their reasoning capabilities, while it remains susceptible to instability due to the use of hard clipping. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) addresses this limitation by replacing clipping with a smooth sigmoid-based gate function, which leads to more stable updates. We have decided to push this theory further and investigate the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance. We formalize the key properties that admissible gates should satisfy and identify several families of such functions for empirical evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of our findings based on experiments conducted with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks. These results provide practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives for large language model training.

### [472] [Active perception and disentangled representations allow continual, episodic zero and few-shot learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19355)
*David Rawlinson,Gideon Kowadlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Complementary Learning System where a fast learner sacrifices generalization for continual zero-shot/few-shot learning, while a slow learner provides structured generalization, enabling robust continual learning through their interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generalization-focused training creates entangled representations that cause destructive interference during rapid updates needed for continual/few-shot learning. Existing fast learning techniques fail to generalize, creating a need for a system that combines both capabilities.

Method: A Complementary Learning System with two components: 1) a fast, disentangled learner that foregoes generalization for continual zero-shot/few-shot learning, and 2) a conventional slow, statistical learner. The fast learner provides contextual bias to help the slow learner encode novel stimuli in familiar terms.

Result: The architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, overcoming observation variability and uncertainty while enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: This CLS approach provides a pathway for robust continual learning by separating fast, non-generalizing reasoning from slow, structured generalization, allowing them to work together through active perception and contextual biasing.

Abstract: Generalization is often regarded as an essential property of machine learning systems. However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.

### [473] [LLMs Can Learn to Reason Via Off-Policy RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19362)
*Daniel Ritter,Owen Oertell,Bradley Guo,Jonathan Chang,Kianté Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OAPL is a novel off-policy RL algorithm for LLMs that embraces policy lag instead of trying to fix it, outperforming existing methods while using fewer training generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL approaches for LLMs assume on-policy data, but distributed training architectures create policy lag between training and inference policies, making data inherently off-policy. Prior work tries to fix this by making off-policy data appear more on-policy, but OAPL takes a different approach.

Method: OAPL (Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy) is a novel off-policy RL algorithm that doesn't require importance sampling or modifications to the inference engine. It embraces the off-policy nature of the data and works effectively even with significant policy lag.

Result: OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, matches DeepCoder's performance on LiveCodeBench using 3x fewer training generations, and shows improved test-time scaling under Pass@k metric. It handles policy lags of over 400 gradient steps (100x more off-policy than prior approaches).

Conclusion: OAPL provides an efficient and effective off-policy RL approach for LLM post-training that embraces rather than fights policy lag, enabling better performance with fewer training resources while handling much larger policy lags than previous methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.

TL;DR: Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization improves RL stability under non-stationarity by encouraging isotropic Gaussian embeddings, which enable stable tracking of time-varying targets and prevent representation collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep reinforcement learning suffers from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time, leading to representation collapse and training instability.

Method: Propose Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization to shape representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training, which is computationally inexpensive and encourages balanced use of all representational dimensions.

Result: Empirical demonstrations across various domains show improved performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

Conclusion: Isotropic Gaussian embeddings provide provable advantages for non-stationary RL, and the proposed regularization method offers a simple, effective solution to improve training stability and adaptability.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

*Jing Ren,Jiapeng Du,Bowen Li,Ziqi Xu,Xin Zheng,Hong Jia,Suyu Ma,Xiwei Xu,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIGHT is a plug-in graph learning module that uses spiking graph predictive coding for reliable uncertainty estimation and OOD generalization in GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world GNN deployment faces pervasive OOD shifts from evolving user activity and changing content semantics, leading to unstable predictions that undermine trustworthiness in Web4Good applications. Existing uncertainty methods are post-hoc, insensitive to distribution shifts, and lack interpretability.

Method: SIGHT (Spiking Graph predictive coding) performs iterative, error-driven correction over spiking graph states to expose internal mismatch signals that reveal where predictions become unreliable.

Result: Across multiple graph benchmarks and diverse OOD scenarios, SIGHT consistently enhances predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability when integrated with GNNs.

Conclusion: SIGHT provides a principled, uncertainty-aware approach for reliable OOD generalization in graph learning, addressing limitations of existing methods through interpretable uncertainty signals.

Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful basis for modeling Web-based relational data, with expressive GNNs to support the effective learning in dynamic web environments. However, real-world deployment is hindered by pervasive out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, where evolving user activity and changing content semantics alter feature distributions and labeling criteria. These shifts often lead to unstable or overconfident predictions, undermining the trustworthiness required for Web4Good applications. Achieving reliable OOD generalization demands principled and interpretable uncertainty estimation; however, existing methods are largely post-hoc, insensitive to distribution shifts, and unable to explain where uncertainty arises especially in high-stakes settings. To address these limitations, we introduce SpIking GrapH predicTive coding (SIGHT), an uncertainty-aware plug-in graph learning module for reliable OOD Generalization. SIGHT performs iterative, error-driven correction over spiking graph states, enabling models to expose internal mismatch signals that reveal where predictions become unreliable. Across multiple graph benchmarks and diverse OOD scenarios, SIGHT consistently enhances predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability when integrated with GNNs.

### [476] [In Defense of Cosine Similarity: Normalization Eliminates the Gauge Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19393)
*Taha Bouhsine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that cosine similarity is valid when embeddings are properly normalized to the unit sphere, contrary to previous claims that it's arbitrary due to gauge matrix ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct a misconception in previous work that cautioned against using cosine similarity in general, showing that the issue is not with cosine similarity itself but with improper normalization of embeddings.

Method: Mathematical proof demonstrating that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere (either during or after training with appropriate objectives), the gauge matrix ambiguity disappears, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance.

Result: Proves that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings, establishing monotonic equivalence between cosine distance and squared Euclidean distance on the unit sphere.

Conclusion: The "problem" with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity itself, but the failure to normalize embeddings properly. Cosine similarity is geometrically valid when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere.

Abstract: Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus [arXiv:2403.05440] demonstrate that cosine similarity of learned embeddings from matrix factorization models can be rendered arbitrary by a diagonal ``gauge'' matrix $D$. Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize.

*Tomas Eglinskas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional taxi tips are highly predictable (R²≈0.72) due to in-car payment screens, while app-based ride-sharing tips are random and hard to predict (R²≈0.17), showing that universal tipping models fail and specialized models are needed for different service types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how app-based ride-sharing has changed tipping culture in NYC and whether tipping patterns can be predicted for traditional taxis versus high-volume for-hire services.

Method: Analyzed 280 million trips from 2024, testing various prediction methods from linear regression to deep neural networks to predict tips for different ride service categories.

Result: Traditional taxis show high predictability (R²≈0.72) due to in-car payment screen interface, while app-based tipping is essentially random and hard to model (R²≈0.17). Combined models suffer from Simpson's paradox - appearing accurate on average but failing to predict individual taxi categories.

Conclusion: Building one universal tipping model is a mistake; specialized models are required for different ride service categories due to fundamentally different tipping behaviors and the statistical trap of Simpson's paradox.

Abstract: The rise of app-based ride-sharing has fundamentally changed tipping culture in New York City. We analyzed 280 million trips from 2024 to see if we could predict tips for traditional taxis versus high-volume for-hire services. By testing methods from linear regression to deep neural networks, we found two very different outcomes. Traditional taxis are highly predictable ($R^2 \approx 0.72$) due to the in-car payment screen. In contrast, app-based tipping is random and hard to model ($R^2 \approx 0.17$). In conclusion, we show that building one universal model is a mistake and, due to Simpson's paradox, a combined model looks accurate on average but fails to predict tips for individual taxi categories requiring specialized models.

*Phillip Si,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEVDA is a latent ensemble variational data assimilation method that performs 4DEnVar optimization in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained neural dynamics surrogate, enabling efficient state and parameter assimilation without adjoint models or fixed observation grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-range geophysical forecasts face limitations from chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. Classical variational smoothers require expensive adjoint models, while recent latent filtering methods have weak trajectory constraints and assume fixed observation grids. There's a need for efficient assimilation that handles irregular sampling and provides reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: LEVDA performs four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. It jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without needing adjoint code or observation-to-latent encoders, leveraging the surrogate's fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature.

Result: Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. It also achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar.

Conclusion: LEVDA bridges the gap between classical variational smoothers and recent latent filtering methods by offering an efficient ensemble-space variational approach that handles irregular sampling, provides reliable uncertainty quantification, and improves both accuracy and computational efficiency for geophysical data assimilation.

Abstract: Long-range geophysical forecasts are fundamentally limited by chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. Simultaneously, it achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar.

*Nazal Mohamed,Ayush Mohanty,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated causal representation learning framework for industrial control systems that enables cross-client counterfactual reasoning without sharing raw data or modifying proprietary local models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial assets are interdependent but client data is high-dimensional and private, making centralized analysis infeasible. Each client has proprietary models that cannot be modified, creating a need for decentralized causal inference.

Method: Each client maps high-dimensional observations to low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control influences. A central server estimates global state-transition and control structure, enabling decentralized counterfactual reasoning through compact latent state exchange.

Result: The framework converges to a centralized oracle, provides privacy guarantees, demonstrates scalability, and achieves accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed federated approach enables causal representation learning and counterfactual reasoning in interdependent industrial systems while respecting data privacy and proprietary model constraints.

Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liquidity providers face a fundamental trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing rebalancing costs (gas fees and swap slippage). Existing heuristic/threshold strategies fail to account for market dynamics.

Method: Formulates liquidity management as optimal control problem with HJB-QVI. Proposes RAmmStein - Deep Reinforcement Learning method using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process mean-reversion speed (theta) and other features as inputs. Agent learns to separate state space into action/inaction regions.

Result: Achieves 0.72% net ROI superior to passive/aggressive strategies. Reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% vs greedy strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Uses high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data (6.8M+ trades).

Conclusion: Regime-aware laziness significantly improves capital efficiency by preserving returns that would otherwise be eroded by operational costs. RL approach effectively balances fee maximization with cost minimization.

Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end deep learning models struggle to capture subtle state transitions in protein trajectories due to lack of explicit physical constraints, limiting understanding of Aβ42 conformational evolution in Alzheimer's disease.

Conclusion: PIS offers a powerful physics-informed approach for robust metastable state partitioning in protein trajectories, enhancing understanding of Aβ42 conformational evolution in Alzheimer's disease research.

Abstract: Understanding the conformational evolution of $β$-amyloid ($Aβ$), particularly the $Aβ_{42}$ isoform, is fundamental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.

In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $Aβ_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework that injects time-series LLM knowledge into general reasoning LLMs using reinforcement learning, achieving superior diagnostic reasoning on time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have a persistent gap: general reasoning LLMs lack domain-specific time-series knowledge, while fine-tuned time-series LLMs lack generalization capacity for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights into GRLM's reasoning trace. Uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfers these in-domain thinking traces into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection.

Result: Method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4% across SenTSR-Bench (their new benchmark) and other public datasets, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively bridges the gap between domain knowledge and general reasoning capabilities, enabling superior time-series diagnostic reasoning without costly data collection for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical predictions require uncertainty quantification, but standard conformal prediction methods fail due to patient distribution shifts violating i.i.d. assumptions in healthcare settings.

Method: Evaluated several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, focusing on personalized calibration strategies to address distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty.

Result: Personalized calibration strategies improved coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes.

Conclusion: Personalized conformal prediction approaches effectively address distribution shift challenges in healthcare AI, with implementation available via the open-source PyHealth framework.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is critical for high-stakes diagnosis tasks. Conformal prediction offers a principled approach by providing prediction sets with theoretical coverage guarantees. However, in practice, patient distribution shifts violate the i.i.d. assumptions underlying standard conformal methods, leading to poor coverage in healthcare settings. In this work, we evaluate several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, a task with known distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty. We demonstrate that personalized calibration strategies can improve coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes.

Users can experiment with heterogeneous client data distributions, model hyperparameters, and aggregation algorithms directly in the browser without coding or system setup, and observe their effects on client and global models through real-time visualizations, gaining intuition for challenges such as non-IID data, local overfitting, and scalability. The playground serves as an easy to use educational tool, lowering the entry barrier for newcomers to distributed AI while also offering a sandbox for rapidly prototyping and comparing FL methods. By democratizing exploration of FL, it promotes broader understanding and adoption of this important paradigm.

*Navid Akhavan Attar,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Ling Luo,Uwe Aickelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-based enhancement of conformal prediction using Helmholtz Free Energy from pre-softmax logits improves prediction set adaptiveness and efficiency without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction uses softmax outputs for nonconformity scores, which can be unreliable indicators of model uncertainty, leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. This unreliability limits the adaptiveness of prediction sets.

Method: Proposes using Helmholtz Free Energy from pre-softmax logit space as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. Reweights nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score to improve sensitivity to input difficulty.

Result: Experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show improved adaptiveness of prediction sets, with notable increases in both efficiency (smaller average set sizes) and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores.

Conclusion: Energy-based enhancement using pre-softmax logit information improves conformal prediction performance by making prediction sets more adaptive and efficient without introducing post-hoc complexity.

Abstract: The merit of Conformal Prediction (CP), as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.

*Rudrajit Das,Neel Patel,Meisam Razaviyayn,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzes convergence of data mixing with finite inner steps, showing greedy approach (T=1) can fail and deriving optimal T scaling as Θ(log N) for full gradients or Θ((N log N)^{1/2}) for stochastic gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data mixing is crucial for training robust models via bilevel optimization, but practical methods use finite inner steps without theoretical understanding of convergence implications.

Method: Rigorous theoretical analysis of data mixing convergence with finite inner steps T, proving failure cases for T=1 and deriving optimal T scaling under fixed parameter update budget N with strongly convex per-domain losses.

Result: Greedy approach (T=1) can fail even in simple quadratic examples. Optimal T scales as Θ(log N) for full gradients and Θ((N log N)^{1/2}) for stochastic gradients under fixed budget N.

Conclusion: Finite inner steps in data mixing require careful selection of T; greedy approach is insufficient, and optimal T scales logarithmically or sublinearly with budget N depending on gradient type.

Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.

### [487] [Variational Trajectory Optimization of Anisotropic Diffusion Schedules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19512)
*Pengxi Liu,Zeyu Michael Li,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anisotropic diffusion framework with matrix-valued noise schedules that improves upon EDM baseline across multiple datasets in all NFE regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use isotropic noise schedules that allocate noise uniformly across all dimensions. This work introduces anisotropic noise schedules to better allocate noise across different subspaces, potentially improving efficiency and performance.

Method: Variational framework with matrix-valued noise schedules M_t(θ) parameterized by θ. Joint training of score network and M_t(θ) using trajectory-level objective. Derivation of efficient estimator for gradient with respect to θ. Development of anisotropic generalization of second-order Heun discretization for reverse-ODE solver.

Result: Consistent improvement over baseline EDM model across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64 datasets in all NFE (Number of Function Evaluations) regimes.

Conclusion: Anisotropic diffusion with learned matrix-valued noise schedules provides a more flexible and effective framework than isotropic approaches, leading to improved performance across various image generation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a variational framework for diffusion models with anisotropic noise schedules parameterized by a matrix-valued path $M_t(θ)$ that allocates noise across subspaces. Central to our framework is a trajectory-level objective that jointly trains the score network and learns $M_t(θ)$, which encompasses general parameterization classes of matrix-valued noise schedules. We further derive an estimator for the derivative with respect to $θ$ of the score that enables efficient optimization of the $M_t(θ)$ schedule. For inference, we develop an efficiently-implementable reverse-ODE solver that is an anisotropic generalization of the second-order Heun discretization algorithm. Across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64, our method consistently improves upon the baseline EDM model in all NFE regimes.

### [488] [Beyond Accuracy: A Unified Random Matrix Theory Diagnostic Framework for Crash Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19528)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral diagnostic framework using Random Matrix Theory and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization analyzes ML models for crash classification, using power-law exponent α to detect overfitting and guide model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC) for crash classification models cannot reveal silent overfitting, creating a need for diagnostic tools that can assess model structural quality and regularization.

Method: Proposes a spectral diagnostic framework based on Random Matrix Theory and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization that analyzes various matrix representations across ML models (BERT, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.) to compute power-law exponent α as a structural quality signal.

Result: Well-regularized models show α within [2, 4] (mean 2.87 ± 0.34), while overfit models show α < 2 or spectral collapse. Strong correlation between α and expert agreement (Spearman ρ=0.89, p<0.001). Framework validated on Iowa DOT crash datasets with 173,512 and 371,062 records.

Conclusion: The spectral framework provides a reliable diagnostic for model quality, enables α-based early stopping and model selection, and scales to large datasets via sparse Lanczos approximations, offering better insights than traditional metrics alone.

Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.

### [489] [A Statistical Approach for Modeling Irregular Multivariate Time Series with Missing Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19531)
*Dingyi Nie,Yixing Wu,C. -C. Jay Kuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simple time-agnostic summary statistics (mean/std of values and changes) outperform complex temporal models for irregular multivariate time series classification, achieving state-of-the-art results with standard classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values are challenging for predictive modeling. Complex deep learning approaches focus on temporal interpolation or architectures, but simpler time-agnostic representations may be sufficient when task objectives permit.

Method: Extract four time-agnostic summary statistics per variable: mean and standard deviation of observed values, plus mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations. Use these fixed-dimensional features with standard classifiers like logistic regression and XGBoost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet 2012/2019, PAMAP2, MIMIC-III), surpassing transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: Complex temporal modeling isn't always necessary for irregular time series classification. Time-agnostic summary statistics provide efficient, interpretable solutions that can outperform sophisticated temporal models, especially when missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.

### [490] [Grokking Finite-Dimensional Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19533)
*Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo,Guillaume Dumas,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends grokking analysis from group operations to finite-dimensional algebras, showing how algebraic properties influence generalization dynamics and connecting learning to matrix factorization and discrete representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, but this paper aims to extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures (finite-dimensional algebras) to understand how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.

Method: The paper connects learning multiplication in finite-dimensional algebras to learning bilinear products via structure tensors. For real algebras, this is linked to matrix factorization with low-rank bias; for finite field algebras, it connects to learning discrete representations. The authors experimentally investigate how algebraic properties (commutativity, associativity, unitality) and structural tensor properties (sparsity, rank) influence grokking emergence and timing.

Result: The paper shows that learning group operations is a special case of learning finite-dimensional algebras, and that grokking emerges naturally in finite field algebras as models must learn discrete representations. The work provides experimental insights into how algebraic properties influence grokking dynamics.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified framework for understanding grokking across algebraic structures and offers new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics, extending beyond group operations to more general algebraic settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the grokking phenomenon, which refers to the sudden transition from a long memorization to generalization observed during neural networks training, in the context of learning multiplication in finite-dimensional algebras (FDA). While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.

*Kasper Green Larsen,Markus Engelund Mathiasen,Chirag Pabbaraju,Clement Svendsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a nearly tight sample complexity lower bound for replicable realizable PAC learning, showing a close to (log|H|)^{3/2} dependence on hypothesis class size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limits of replicable learning algorithms in the realizable PAC setting, specifically the dependence of sample complexity on hypothesis class size.

Method: Constructs a particularly hard learning problem instance, defines a Cayley graph associated with the hypothesis class H, and analyzes a random walk on this graph using spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix.

Result: Proves a sample complexity lower bound with close to (log|H|)^{3/2} dependence on hypothesis class size, and shows this is almost tight by providing a matching upper bound for the constructed instance.

Conclusion: The (log|H|)^{3/2} dependence is essentially optimal for replicable realizable PAC learning; any stronger lower bound would require considering different problem instances.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of replicable realizable PAC learning. We construct a particularly hard learning problem and show a sample complexity lower bound with a close to $(\log|H|)^{3/2}$ dependence on the size of the hypothesis class $H$. Our proof uses several novel techniques and works by defining a particular Cayley graph associated with $H$ and analyzing a suitable random walk on this graph by examining the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.
  Furthermore, we show an almost matching upper bound for the lower bound instance, meaning if a stronger lower bound exists, one would have to consider a different instance of the problem.

### [492] [Leap+Verify: Regime-Adaptive Speculative Weight Prediction for Accelerating Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19580)
*Jeremy McEntire*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Leap+Verify accelerates neural network training using speculative execution with weight prediction and validation, showing that finite-difference predictors work while momentum-based prediction fails catastrophically, with larger models being more predictable when predictable but less often predictable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate neural network training by applying speculative execution techniques similar to those used in language model inference, predicting future model weights and validating predictions before acceptance to reduce training time.

Method: Decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a Lyapunov proxy. Uses analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) to forecast model parameters K steps ahead, with predictions accepted only when validated against held-out loss criterion.

Result: Momentum-based prediction fails catastrophically with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x. Finite-difference predictors succeed: at 124M scale, achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B scale, achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. Larger models spend more time in chaotic regimes (64% for 1.5B vs 34% stable for 124M). Cross-seed results are highly consistent with less than 1% validation loss variance.

Conclusion: Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable - the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. The three-regime framework produces consistent phase boundaries across seeds, showing potential for training acceleration through speculative execution.

Abstract: We introduce Leap+Verify, a framework that applies speculative execution -- predicting future model weights and validating predictions before acceptance -- to accelerate neural network training. Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds.

### [493] [Advantage-based Temporal Attack in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19582)
*Shenghong He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AAT (Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer) generates time-correlated adversarial examples for DRL by using multi-scale causal self-attention and weighted advantage mechanisms to improve attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward-based adversarial attacks on DRL models lack temporal correlation between perturbations across sequential time steps, resulting in weak attack effectiveness. The paper aims to improve attack performance by generating adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations.

Method: Proposes AAT with two key components: 1) Multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) to capture dependencies between historical information and current state, enhancing temporal correlation between perturbations; 2) Weighted advantage mechanism that quantifies perturbation effectiveness and guides generation toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite, and Google Football tasks, demonstrating improved attack performance through time-correlated adversarial examples.

Conclusion: AAT effectively generates time-correlated adversarial examples for DRL by capturing temporal dependencies and leveraging advantage-based guidance, achieving superior attack performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark environments.

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.

*Biswajit Sadhu,Kalpak Gupte,Trijit Sadhu,S. Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML framework using interpolation-augmented data improves radiation dose prediction accuracy, with XGBoost performing best among tree-based and deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning for radiation dose assessment faces challenges: safety-critical constraints, scarce training data, and difficulty selecting architectures for physics-dominated systems. Rapid plume shine dose estimation is critical for nuclear safety and emergency response, but conventional calculations are computationally expensive.

Method: Developed interpolation-assisted ML framework using discrete dose datasets generated with pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying parameters. Augmented datasets with shape-preserving interpolation to create dense training data. Evaluated Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet models, analyzing sensitivity to dataset resolution.

Result: All models showed higher accuracy with interpolated high-resolution data, with XGBoost achieving highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis revealed tree-based models focus on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, distance) while treating radionuclide identity as secondary, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across variables.

Conclusion: Interpolation-assisted ML framework effectively improves radiation dose prediction accuracy. XGBoost performs best, and interpretability analysis explains performance differences. Practical deployment includes web-based GUI for interactive scenario evaluation and comparison with reference calculations.

Abstract: Despite the success of machine learning (ML) in surrogate modeling, its use in radiation dose assessment is limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training-ready data, and challenges in selecting suitable architectures for physics-dominated systems. Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.

TL;DR: SME-HGT: A Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using public data, achieving 0.621 AUPRC and 89.6% precision at screening depth of 100 companies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses and generate 44% of economic activity, but systematically identifying high-potential SMEs remains challenging. There's a need for better tools to predict SME success using publicly available data.

Method: SME-HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer) constructs a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by ~99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. The framework uses exclusively public data and employs a temporal evaluation protocol to prevent information leakage.

Result: SME-HGT achieves AUPRC of 0.621 (±0.003), outperforming MLP baseline (0.590) and R-GCN (0.608). At screening depth of 100 companies, it attains 89.6% precision with 2.14× lift over random selection. The temporal evaluation ensures no information leakage.

Conclusion: Relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment. The framework demonstrates practical value for policymakers and early-stage investors in identifying high-potential SMEs using public data.

Abstract: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) constitute 99.9% of U.S. businesses and generate 44% of economic activity, yet systematically identifying high-potential SMEs remains an open challenge. We introduce SME-HGT, a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using exclusively public data. We construct a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by approximately 99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. SME-HGT achieves an AUPRC of 0.621 0.003 on a temporally-split test set, outperforming an MLP baseline (0.590 0.002) and R-GCN (0.608 0.013) across five random seeds. At a screening depth of 100 companies, SME-HGT attains 89.6% precision with a 2.14 lift over random selection. Our temporal evaluation protocol prevents information leakage, and our reliance on public data ensures reproducibility. These results demonstrate that relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment, with implications for policymakers and early-stage investors.

### [496] [ISO-Bench: Can Coding Agents Optimize Real-World Inference Workloads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19594)
*Ayush Nangia,Shikhar Mishra,Aman Gokrani,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ISO-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating coding agents on real-world inference optimization tasks from vLLM and SGLang frameworks, using 54 curated tasks with both execution-based and LLM-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for coding agents rely heavily on runtime-based metrics that can be gamed without capturing the actual intent of code changes. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation that combines both hard and soft metrics to properly assess coding agents' capabilities on real-world optimization tasks.

Method: Created ISO-Bench with 54 tasks from merged pull requests in vLLM and SGLang frameworks. Each task provides agents with codebase and bottleneck description, requiring them to produce optimization patches evaluated against expert human solutions. Uses combination of hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: No single coding agent dominates across codebases. Agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. Agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model itself.

Conclusion: Both hard and soft metrics are necessary for complete evaluation of coding agents. Scaffolding design is crucial for agent performance, sometimes as important as the underlying model. The benchmark reveals significant gaps in current coding agents' ability to execute working solutions even when they correctly identify optimization bottlenecks.

Abstract: We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.

### [497] [Variational Inference for Bayesian MIDAS Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19610)
*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAVI algorithm for Bayesian MIDAS regression with linear weight parameterizations achieves 107-1772x speedup over Gibbs sampling while maintaining near-identical posterior means, though mean-field approximation causes underdispersion in credible intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian MIDAS regression with linear weight parameterizations creates a bilinear structure that makes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo unreliable, but preserves conditional conjugacy that can be exploited by CAVI for efficient inference.

Method: Developed Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm with closed-form updates: Gaussian for regression coefficients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for error variance. Propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments.

Result: CAVI achieves 107x to 1,772x speedup over Gibbs sampler with nearly identical posterior means. Weight parameters maintain >92% coverage, but impact coefficients show underdispersion (89% to 55% coverage as predictors increase). ADVI produces 714x larger bias and is slower.

Conclusion: Model-specific CAVI derivation provides dramatic speed improvements while maintaining good calibration for weight parameters, though mean-field approximation trades interval calibration for speed - a limitation that structured variational methods could address.

Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameteri zations. The model separates impact coe cients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conju gacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coe cients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating con gurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic di eren tiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, con rming the value of model-speci c derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all con gurations. Impact coe cient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean- eld approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-o between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&P 500 daily returns con rms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.

### [498] [Is Your Diffusion Sampler Actually Correct? A Sampler-Centric Evaluation of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19619)
*Luhan Tang,Longxuan Yu,Shaorong Zhang,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sampler-centric oracle framework to isolate and analyze sampler-induced error in discrete diffusion language models, showing that few-step samplers are not distributionally correct even with perfect denoisers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for discrete diffusion language models conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from sampling dynamics, making it difficult to properly assess sampler performance. This problem doesn't exist for autoregressive models where sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model.

Method: The authors introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain. This isolates sampler-induced error in a controlled setting, allowing for pure evaluation of sampling algorithms independent of denoiser quality.

Result: The study shows that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser. Transition-level mismatch persists and only vanishes as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Additionally, improvements in standard metrics like negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not guarantee correct sampling.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates fundamental limitations in few-step discrete diffusion samplers and highlights the need for better evaluation methods that can properly isolate and measure sampler-induced error, separate from denoiser approximation quality.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling. Code is available at https://luhantang.github.io/dllm_sampler

TL;DR: VecFormer is an efficient and generalizable Graph Transformer that uses vector quantization to reduce computational complexity and improve OOD performance for node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers face two key challenges: (1) exponentially increasing computational complexity that limits scalability to large graphs, and (2) node-level attention mechanisms that reduce flexibility and result in poor generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: VecFormer uses a two-stage training paradigm: First, two codebooks reconstruct node features and graph structure to learn rich semantic Graph Codes. Second, attention mechanisms operate at the Graph Token level using transformed cross codebook, reducing complexity while enhancing generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes show that VecFormer outperforms existing Graph Transformers in both performance and speed.

Conclusion: VecFormer successfully addresses computational complexity and generalization limitations of existing Graph Transformers through vector quantization and token-level attention, making it an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, especially in OOD settings.

Abstract: Graph Transformer has demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of graph representation learning. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VecFormer} (the \textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed.

*Jesse Farebrother,Matteo Pirotta,Andrea Tirinzoni,Marc G. Bellemare,Alessandro Lazaric,Ahmed Touati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jumpy world models enable compositional planning by learning multi-step dynamics of pre-trained policies, improving long-horizon task performance through temporal abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning with temporal abstractions is crucial for intelligent decision-making, but compositional planning faces challenges due to compounding errors in long-horizon predictions when sequencing pre-trained policies.

Method: Learn jumpy world models that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales. Enhance with consistency objective from Temporal Difference Flows to align predictions across timescales. Combine generative predictions to estimate value of arbitrary policy sequences.

Result: Compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding 200% relative improvement over primitive action planning on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Jumpy world models enable effective compositional planning by addressing long-horizon prediction challenges, allowing agents to solve complex tasks by sequencing pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions.

Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.

*Marvin Chen,Manuel Eberhardinger,Johannes Maucher*

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies how anonymization affects Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) performance, finding that models trained on original data produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing privacy regulations like GDPR, anonymizing visual data is crucial, but anonymization can negatively impact Computer Vision systems like CBIR. The impact hasn't been systematically studied, especially for practical applications like the DOKIQ document verification system used by law enforcement.

Method: Proposed a simple evaluation framework where retrieval results after anonymization should match pre-anonymization results. Systematically assessed impact using two public datasets and the internal DOKIQ dataset, testing three anonymization methods, four anonymization degrees, and four training strategies based on DINOv2 backbone.

Result: Revealed a pronounced retrieval bias favoring models trained on original data, which produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization. This provides insights into how anonymization affects CBIR performance.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical insights for developing privacy-compliant CBIR systems while preserving performance, addressing the tension between privacy requirements and system functionality.

Abstract: With the growing importance of privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, anonymizing visual data is becoming increasingly relevant across institutions. However, anonymization can negatively affect the performance of Computer Vision systems that rely on visual features, such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Despite this, the impact of anonymization on CBIR has not been systematically studied. This work addresses this gap, motivated by the DOKIQ project, an artificial intelligence-based system for document verification actively used by the State Criminal Police Office Baden-Württemberg. We propose a simple evaluation framework: retrieval results after anonymization should match those obtained before anonymization as closely as possible. To this end, we systematically assess the impact of anonymization using two public datasets and the internal DOKIQ dataset. Our experiments span three anonymization methods, four anonymization degrees, and four training strategies, all based on the state of the art backbone Self-Distillation with No Labels (DINO)v2. Our results reveal a pronounced retrieval bias in favor of models trained on original data, which produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization. The findings of this paper offer practical insights for developing privacy-compliant CBIR systems while preserving performance.

*Pablo Herrero Gómez,Antonio Jimeno Morenilla,David Muñoz-Hernández,Higinio Mora Mora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum kernel methods with DFT preprocessing show superior robustness to data corruption compared to other quantum variants and classical baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum machine learning, but their behavior under data corruption remains insufficiently understood, necessitating analysis of how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise.

Method: Introduced Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construction combining DFT front-end with diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with diagonal quantum maps. Compared QK-DFT against QK-PCA, QK-RP quantum variants and classical SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection. Quantified robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets.

Result: DFT-based preprocessing yields smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically supported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware experiments confirm SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation.

Conclusion: Robustness in quantum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum ma- chine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insuf- ficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEXUS is a lightweight neural architecture for forecasting urban air pollutants in Delhi NCR, achieving high accuracy (R² > 0.94) with only 18,748 parameters, outperforming larger models while enabling real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban air pollution in megacities like Delhi NCR poses critical public health challenges affecting millions, requiring accurate forecasting systems for air quality monitoring and management.

Method: NEXUS architecture integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion mechanisms to decode complex atmospheric chemistry patterns using four years (2018-2021) of atmospheric data across sixteen spatial grids.

Conclusion: NEXUS delivers superior predictive performance with remarkable computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment for air quality monitoring systems while providing insights into pollution patterns and drivers.

Abstract: Urban air pollution in megacities poses critical public health challenges, particularly in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) where severe degradation affects millions. We present NEXUS (Neural Extraction and Unified Spatiotemporal) architecture for forecasting carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. Working with four years (2018--2021) of atmospheric data across sixteen spatial grids, NEXUS achieves R$^2$ exceeding 0.94 for CO, 0.91 for NO, and 0.95 for SO$_2$ using merely 18,748 parameters -- substantially fewer than SCINet (35,552), Autoformer (68,704), and FEDformer (298,080). The architecture integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion mechanisms to decode complex atmospheric chemistry patterns. Our investigation uncovers distinct diurnal rhythms and pronounced seasonal variations, with winter months experiencing severe pollution episodes driven by temperature inversions and agricultural biomass burning. Analysis identifies critical meteorological thresholds, quantifies wind field impacts on pollutant dispersion, and maps spatial heterogeneity across the region. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate each architectural component's role. NEXUS delivers superior predictive performance with remarkable computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment for air quality monitoring systems.

*Vishnu Subramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A minimal continual learning agent shows emergent stability-plasticity tradeoffs through representational dynamics analysis, without complex architectures or explicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning systems often focus on task performance rather than how internal representations evolve over time, especially in environments where retraining/reset is infeasible. There's a need to study representational dynamics in isolation from architectural complexity.

Method: A minimal continual learning agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions, incrementally updating it with new textual data. Representational change is quantified using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors, with stability metrics defined over time intervals.

Result: Longitudinal experiments across eight executions show a transition from initial plastic regime to stable representational regime under consistent input. Semantic perturbations cause bounded similarity decreases followed by recovery and restabilization with coherent subsequent input.

Conclusion: Meaningful stability-plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in minimal stateful learning systems without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. This establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning systems are increasingly deployed in environments where retraining or reset is infeasible, yet many approaches emphasize task performance rather than the evolution of internal representations over time. In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

*Kihyuk Yoon,Lingchao Mao,Catherine Chong,Todd J. Schwedt,Chia-Chun Chiang,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaReGTA is an LLM-based framework that converts longitudinal EHR data into templated text with temporal cues, learns visit embeddings via contrastive fine-tuning, and aggregates them with hybrid temporal pooling for patient representation, performing well even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EHR representations lose temporal information (sparse one-hot/count-based) while sequence models are costly and data-hungry. There's a need for efficient temporal-aware patient representations that work well with limited data.

Method: 1) Convert longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues. 2) Learn domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model. 3) Aggregate visit embeddings using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. 4) PaReGTA-RSS for interpretability quantifies factor importance through representation shifts after targeted factor removal.

Result: On 39,088 migraine patients from All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification. Deep sequential models were unstable in this cohort.

Conclusion: PaReGTA provides an effective, data-efficient approach for temporal EHR representation learning using LLMs, with interpretability features and model-agnostic design that can leverage future EHR-specialized embedding models.

Abstract: Temporal information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often lost in sparse one-hot or count-based representations, while sequence models can be costly and data-hungry. We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model. On 39,088 migraine patients from the All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification while deep sequential models were unstable in our cohort.

### [506] [PerturbDiff: Functional Diffusion for Single-Cell Perturbation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19685)
*Xinyu Yuan,Xixian Liu,Ya Shi Zhang,Zuobai Zhang,Hongyu Guo,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerturbDiff is a novel method for single-cell perturbation prediction that models entire probability distributions rather than individual cells, using Hilbert space embeddings and diffusion processes to capture population-level response variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fundamental challenge in single-cell perturbation prediction is that sequencing is destructive - the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation. Existing models assume fixed response distributions for given conditions, but in reality responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors like microenvironmental fluctuations and batch effects.

Method: PerturbDiff shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions by embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space and defining a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows capturing population-level response shifts across hidden factors.

Result: Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PerturbDiff represents a paradigm shift in perturbation prediction by modeling entire distributions rather than individual cells, enabling better capture of response variability and improved generalization to unseen perturbations, advancing the goal of building accurate Virtual Cells.

Abstract: Building Virtual Cells that can accurately simulate cellular responses to perturbations is a long-standing goal in systems biology. A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of the "curse of unrolling" phenomenon in algorithm unrolling, showing early divergence of derivative iterates from true Jacobians, with truncation and warm-starting as practical remedies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithm unrolling is widely used in ML for hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, but recent work shows derivative iterates may initially diverge from true Jacobians (curse of unrolling). The paper aims to understand this phenomenon and provide practical solutions.

Method: Provides non-asymptotic analysis of the curse of unrolling, identifies algorithmic factors governing the behavior, proposes truncating early derivative iterations, and shows warm-starting in bilevel optimization induces implicit truncation.

Result: Theoretical analysis explains the origin of the curse of unrolling, shows truncation mitigates the issue while reducing memory, and demonstrates warm-starting provides practical remedy. Numerical experiments support findings.

Conclusion: Truncating early derivative iterations addresses the curse of unrolling, and warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally provides this truncation, offering practical solutions for algorithm unrolling applications.

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling is ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, where Jacobians of solution mappings are computed by differentiating through iterative algorithms. Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on representative examples.

TL;DR: A representation learning framework that uses cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous genetic instruments for Mendelian Randomization, addressing violations of core assumptions like independence between instruments and unobserved confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is widely used in observational epidemiology for causal inference, but its core assumptions (especially independence between instruments and unobserved confounders) are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating, leading to biased estimates.

Method: The authors propose a representation learning framework that leverages multi-environment data to exploit cross-environment invariance. The method recovers latent exogenous components of genetic instruments by identifying patterns that remain stable across different environments, providing theoretical guarantees under various mixing mechanisms.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub, showing improved causal effect estimation when traditional MR assumptions are violated.

Conclusion: The proposed representation learning framework offers a robust solution to address violations of MR assumptions by recovering latent exogenous genetic instruments through cross-environment invariance, potentially improving causal inference in observational epidemiological studies with genetic data.

Abstract: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a prominent observational epidemiological research method designed to address unobserved confounding when estimating causal effects. However, core assumptions -- particularly the independence between instruments and unobserved confounders -- are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating. Leveraging the increasing availability of multi-environment data, we propose a representation learning framework that exploits cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous components of genetic instruments. We provide theoretical guarantees for identifying these latent instruments under various mixing mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

TL;DR: Causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method uses latent causal task embeddings to enable transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations, reducing negative transfer in out-of-distribution adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning methods often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks due to negative transfer from source tasks, especially when relying on spurious correlations rather than true causal mechanisms.

Method: Proposes causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning that conditions task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity. Considers realistic deployment with limited target-task data and noisy expert-provided pairwise judgments of causal similarity.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirical results demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in controlled simulations and large-scale real-world clinical prediction for cross-disease transfer.

Conclusion: Causal task embeddings aligned with underlying mechanisms enable more robust meta-learning for out-of-distribution adaptation, particularly valuable in domains like clinical prediction where mechanistic understanding is crucial.

Abstract: Meta-learning methods perform well on new within-distribution tasks but often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks, where transfer from source tasks can induce negative transfer. We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.

*Sophia N. Wilson,Guðrún Fjóla Guðmundsdóttir,Andrew Millard,Raghavendra Selvan,Sebastian Mair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that ML community must shift from just talking about data frugality to actually practicing it, as continued data scaling has diminishing returns and significant environmental costs, while data-efficient methods like coreset selection can reduce energy use with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ML community has long equated progress with larger datasets, but this approach now yields diminishing performance gains while increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Despite growing awareness of data frugal approaches, adoption remains rhetorical while data scaling continues to dominate practice, creating a gap between preach and practice with substantial environmental impacts.

Method: The paper provides indicative estimates of energy use and carbon emissions from downstream use of ImageNet-1K, and presents empirical evidence that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little accuracy loss while also mitigating dataset bias.

Result: Data frugality is both practical and beneficial - coreset-based subset selection can significantly reduce training energy consumption with minimal accuracy degradation, while also helping to address dataset bias issues.

Conclusion: The ML community must move from rhetorical preaching to concrete practice of data frugality for responsible AI development, and the paper outlines actionable recommendations to achieve this shift.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community must move from preaching to practising data frugality for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development. For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions. While awareness of data frugal approaches has grown, their adoption has remained rhetorical, and data scaling continues to dominate development practice. We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias. Finally, we outline actionable recommendations for moving data frugality from rhetorical preach to concrete practice for responsible development of AI.

*Fabian Hinder,Valerie Vaquet,Johannes Brinkrolf,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conformal prediction-based approach for drift localization that addresses limitations of local testing methods in high-dimensional, low-signal settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift poses significant challenges for learning systems, and understanding drift through localization (identifying which samples are affected) is essential for effective monitoring. Existing approaches based on local testing schemes often fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings.

Method: The paper introduces a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions, which provides a principled framework for uncertainty quantification and drift detection without relying on traditional local testing schemes.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to common methods, particularly in challenging high-dimensional, low-signal scenarios, as validated on state-of-the-art image datasets.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction-based methods offer a robust alternative to local testing approaches for drift localization, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods in complex, high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.

TL;DR: DMM replaces Mamba's selective scanning with dense sequence mixing to prevent information loss in RL, achieving SOTA performance with compact parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba-based models in offline RL suffer from information loss when key steps in RL sequences are omitted due to their selective scanning mechanism, which can be detrimental to performance.

Method: Proposes Decision MetaMamba (DMM) which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer, modifies positional structure to preserve local information, and performs sequence mixing considering all channels simultaneously before Mamba to prevent information loss.

Result: DMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks while maintaining a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

Conclusion: DMM effectively addresses Mamba's selective scanning limitations in RL by using dense sequence mixing, offering superior performance with efficient parameter usage for practical RL applications.

Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

*Hyunwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers solved the "shuffled ResNet layers" puzzle by developing methods to pair and order unlabeled neural network layers using training stability signatures and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from an interesting puzzle presented in a podcast: given shuffled layers of a Residual Network and its training dataset, can we recover the exact original ordering? This has practical implications for understanding neural network structure and training dynamics.

Method: The method decomposes the problem into two parts: (1) pairing each block's input and output projections using diagonal dominance ratio as a signal (based on stability conditions during training), and (2) ordering the reassembled blocks using hill-climbing optimization seeded with rough proxies like delta-norm or Frobenius norm.

Result: The researchers successfully recovered the exact ordering of layers from the massive search space of (48!)² ≈ 10¹²² possibilities by leveraging training stability signatures and optimization techniques.

Conclusion: Training stability conditions like dynamic isometry leave identifiable signatures in neural network weights that can be used to reconstruct layer ordering, demonstrating that neural networks contain more structural information than previously thought.

Abstract: A recent Dwarkesh Patel podcast with John Collison and Elon Musk featured an interesting puzzle from Jane Street: they trained a neural net, shuffled all 96 layers, and asked to put them back in order.
  Given unlabelled layers of a Residual Network and its training dataset, we recover the exact ordering of the layers. The problem decomposes into pairing each block's input and output projections ($48!$ possibilities) and ordering the reassembled blocks ($48!$ possibilities), for a combined search space of $(48!)^2 \approx 10^{122}$, which is more than the atoms in the observable universe. We show that stability conditions during training like dynamic isometry leave the product $W_{\text{out}} W_{\text{in}}$ for correctly paired layers with a negative diagonal structure, allowing us to use diagonal dominance ratio as a signal for pairing. For ordering, we seed-initialize with a rough proxy such as delta-norm or $\|W_{\text{out}}\|_F$ then hill-climb to zero mean squared error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for Hessian estimation in optimization when only noisy function measurements are available, without gradient information, using random direction approaches.

Method: Family of generalized Hessian estimators using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) with varying numbers of function measurements; asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analysis for stochastic Newton methods.

Result: More function measurements lead to lower-order estimation bias; estimators are asymptotically unbiased; theoretical convergence results validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Proposed generalized Hessian estimators provide flexible trade-off between measurement cost and bias reduction, enabling effective stochastic Newton methods with only function measurements.

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

*Zhongwei Wan,Yun Shen,Zhihao Dou,Donghao Zhou,Yu Zhang,Xin Wang,Hui Shen,Jing Xiong,Chaofan Tao,Zixuan Zhong,Peizhou Huang,Mi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSDR introduces dual-scale diversity regularization for RLVR to address exploration collapse in LLM reasoning by promoting global diversity among correct reasoning trajectories and local token-level entropy within each mode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from limited exploration where policies collapse onto few reasoning patterns, conventional entropy regularization only introduces local stochasticity without meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization.

Method: DSDR decomposes diversity into global and coupling components: globally promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes; locally applies length-invariant token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories; coupled through global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories.

Result: Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Conclusion: DSDR provides a principled framework for addressing exploration collapse in RLVR through dual-scale diversity regularization, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

TL;DR: MSFlow is a two-stage flow-matching generative model that translates mass spectra into molecular structures with 45% accuracy, a 14x improvement over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry is powerful for molecular identification but translating spectra into full structures is a difficult inverse problem. Solving this is crucial for biological insight, metabolite discovery, and advancing chemical research.

Method: Two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching model: 1) formula-restricted transformer encodes mass spectra into continuous chemically informative embeddings, 2) decoder flow matching model reconstructs molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra.

Result: MSFlow achieves 45% accuracy in translating molecular mass spectra into corresponding molecular representations - a 14-fold improvement over current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: MSFlow provides a significant advancement in molecular structure elucidation from mass spectra, with the trained model made publicly available on GitHub for non-commercial users.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for identifying molecular structures due to its sensitivity and ability to profile complex samples. However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra. We present ablation studies demonstrating the importance of using information-preserving molecular descriptors for encoding mass spectra and motivate the use of our discrete flow-based decoder. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that MSFlow can accurately translate up to 45 percent of molecular mass spectra into their corresponding molecular representations - an improvement of up to fourteen-fold over the current state-of-the-art. A trained version of MSFlow is made publicly available on GitHub for non-commercial users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microstructure simulation methods like phase-field models are computationally expensive due to solving complex PDEs at fine resolutions, creating a need for faster alternatives.

Method: Fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in self-supervised manner using sequential images from simulations of grain growth and spinodal decomposition processes.

Result: Model learns physical dynamics, captures short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties, generalizes to unseen domains and parameter variations, and outperforms RNNs with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Establishes robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers scalable, data-driven alternative for fast microstructure simulations.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting microstructure evolution is fundamental to materials science, as it governs the resulting properties and performance of materials. Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LA-LoRA improves privacy-preserving federated learning for large vision/language models by addressing gradient coupling, noise amplification, and model sharpness issues in LoRA-based fine-tuning under differential privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large vision and language models under differentially private federated learning faces a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. While LoRA reduces computational costs, it suffers performance degradation in DPFL settings due to gradient coupling, noise amplification, and model sharpness issues.

Method: Proposes LA-LoRA (Local Alternating LoRA) that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients. It addresses three challenges: (1) gradient coupling from simultaneous updates of asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under DP, and (3) sharpness of global aggregated models.

Result: LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showing robustness to DP noise. For Swin-B on Tiny-ImageNet under ε=1, it outperforms RoLoRA by 16.83% in test accuracy.

Conclusion: LA-LoRA effectively addresses key challenges in DPFL fine-tuning of large models, providing stronger convergence guarantees and broad applicability across both vision and language models under strict privacy constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) under differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is hindered by a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, reduces computational and communication costs by introducing two trainable low-rank matrices while freezing pre-trained weights. However, directly applying LoRA in DPFL settings leads to performance degradation, especially in LVMs. Our analysis reveals three previously underexplored challenges: (1) gradient coupling caused by the simultaneous update of two asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under differential privacy, and (3) sharpness of the global aggregated model in the parameter space. To address these issues, we propose LA-LoRA (\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}lternating \textbf{LoRA}), a novel approach that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients to enhance robustness under stringent privacy constraints. Theoretically, LA-LoRA strengthens convergence guarantees in noisy federated environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showcasing robustness to DP noise and broad applicability across both LVMs and LLMs. For example, when fine-tuning the Swin-B model on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset under a strict privacy budget ($ε= 1$), LA-LoRA outperforms the best baseline, RoLoRA, by 16.83\% in test accuracy.

*Pin-Han Huang,Shang-Tse Chen,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using diffusion model representations as auxiliary learning signals in adversarial training improves robust classifier performance beyond just using diffusion-generated synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed diffusion-generated synthetic data improves adversarial training, but diffusion models' internal representations may provide additional benefits for robust classifier training.

Method: Systematically incorporate diffusion model representations as auxiliary learning signals during adversarial training, analyzing their diversity, robustness, and feature disentanglement properties.

Result: Diffusion representations are diverse and partially robust, and their explicit incorporation consistently improves robustness across settings. They encourage more disentangled features and complement diffusion-generated synthetic data.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within adversarial training is effective, as demonstrated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.

*Zijie Liu,Jie Peng,Jinhao Duan,Zirui Liu,Kaixiong Zhou,Mingfu Liang,Luke Simon,Xi Liu,Zhaozhuo Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replicate-and-Quantize (R&Q) is a training-free framework that rebalances expert workloads in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models during inference by replicating heavy-hitter experts and quantizing less critical ones, reducing load imbalance by up to 1.4x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE models suffer from severe load imbalance during inference where a few experts handle most tokens while others are underutilized. Prior work focused on training solutions, leaving inference-time behavior - critical for deployment - unexplored. The paper aims to address this inference-time imbalance without retraining.

Method: The paper proposes Replicate-and-Quantize (R&Q): 1) Analyze expert routing during inference to identify load imbalance patterns, 2) Replicate heavy-hitter experts to increase parallel capacity, 3) Quantize less critical experts and replicas to stay within original memory budget, 4) Introduce Load-Imbalance Score (LIS) to measure routing skew, and 5) Use a small calibration set to estimate expert workload and importance.

Result: Experiments show up to 1.4x reduction in load imbalance while maintaining accuracy within +/-0.6% across representative SMoE models and benchmarks. The method enables more predictable and efficient inference without retraining or router modification.

Conclusion: R&Q provides an effective training-free solution for inference-time workload rebalancing in SMoE models, addressing deployment-critical load imbalance issues while preserving model accuracy and staying within memory constraints.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are increasingly used to scale large language models efficiently, delivering strong accuracy under fixed compute budgets. However, SMoE models often suffer from severe load imbalance across experts, where a small subset of experts receives most tokens while others are underutilized. Prior work has focused mainly on training-time solutions such as routing regularization or auxiliary losses, leaving inference-time behavior, which is critical for deployment, less explored.
  We present a systematic analysis of expert routing during inference and identify three findings: (i) load imbalance persists and worsens with larger batch sizes, (ii) selection frequency does not reliably reflect expert importance, and (iii) overall expert workload and importance can be estimated using a small calibration set. These insights motivate inference-time mechanisms that rebalance workloads without retraining or router modification.
  We propose Replicate-and-Quantize (R&Q), a training-free and near-lossless framework for dynamic workload rebalancing. In each layer, heavy-hitter experts are replicated to increase parallel capacity, while less critical experts and replicas are quantized to remain within the original memory budget. We also introduce a Load-Imbalance Score (LIS) to measure routing skew by comparing heavy-hitter load to an equal allocation baseline. Experiments across representative SMoE models and benchmarks show up to 1.4x reduction in imbalance with accuracy maintained within +/-0.6%, enabling more predictable and efficient inference.

*Jin Liu,Yinbin Miao,Ning Xi,Junkang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-FedAdamW is a novel AdamW-based optimizer for differentially private federated learning that addresses three key issues: variance amplification of second-moment estimator, DP-induced bias, and client drift from local overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of AdamW to differentially private federated learning suffers from three major problems: (1) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify second-moment estimator variance, (2) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (3) DP amplifies AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift.

Method: DP-FedAdamW restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. It provides an unbiased second-moment estimator and proves linearly accelerated convergence without heterogeneity assumptions.

Result: DP-FedAdamW outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.83% on Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, ε=1) and demonstrates effectiveness across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18 models.

Conclusion: DP-FedAdamW successfully balances convergence efficiency and robustness in differentially private federated learning by addressing key limitations of AdamW under DP constraints, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Balancing convergence efficiency and robustness under Differential Privacy (DP) is a central challenge in Federated Learning (FL). While AdamW accelerates training and fine-tuning in large-scale models, we find that directly applying it to Differentially Private FL (DPFL) suffers from three major issues: (i) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify the variance of second-moment estimator, (ii) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (iii) DP amplify AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift. We propose DP-FedAdamW, the first AdamW-based optimizer for DPFL. It restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. Theoretically, we establish an unbiased second-moment estimator and prove a linearly accelerated convergence rate without any heterogeneity assumption, while providing tighter $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP guarantees. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedAdamW across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18. On Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, $\varepsilon=1$), DP-FedAdamW outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.83\%. The code is available in Appendix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an attention-based masking method for RL abstraction that better generalizes to unseen tasks by integrating learned masking with attention weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing abstraction methods in RL remove unnecessary information to improve generalization, but the representation extraction function itself may not generalize well to unseen observations.

Method: Uses a learned masking function integrated with attention weights within an attention-based policy network to remove information more reliably.

Result: Significantly improves policy generalization to unseen tasks in the Procgen benchmark compared to standard PPO and other masking approaches.

Conclusion: The attention-integrated masking approach provides more reliable generalization of information removal to new states, addressing a key weakness in existing abstraction methods.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, abstraction methods that remove unnecessary information from the observation are commonly used to learn policies which generalize better to unseen tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial weakness: the function which extracts the reduced-information representation has unknown generalization ability in unseen observations. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an information removal method which more reliably generalizes to new states. We accomplish this by using a learned masking function which operates on, and is integrated with, the attention weights within an attention-based policy network. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves policy generalization to unseen tasks in the Procgen benchmark compared to standard PPO and masking approaches.

TL;DR: RND's uncertainty measure equals deep ensemble predictive variance in infinite-width limit; modified Bayesian RND can exactly sample from Bayesian posterior predictive distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random network distillation (RND) is empirically effective for uncertainty quantification but lacks theoretical grounding and clear connections to established methods like Bayesian inference and deep ensembles.

Method: Analyze RND within neural tangent kernel framework in infinite network width limit; construct specific RND target function to establish equivalence with Bayesian inference; develop posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian RND.

Result: 1) RND's squared self-predictive error equals deep ensemble predictive variance. 2) Modified RND error distribution mirrors centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference. 3) Developed algorithm to generate i.i.d. samples from exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using Bayesian RND.

Conclusion: Provides unified theoretical perspective connecting RND to deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, enabling efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

TL;DR: P-PINN: A pruning framework that removes noise-sensitive neurons from pretrained PINNs to improve robustness against corrupted data in PDE inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are sensitive to noise in inverse PDE problems, where even small corrupted observations can distort neural representations and destabilize training. There's a need for robust methods that can handle noisy data while maintaining accuracy.

Method: 1) Train PINN on full dataset, 2) Use joint residual-data fidelity indicator to partition data into reliable/corrupted subsets, 3) Introduce bias-based neuron importance measure to identify neurons driven by corrupted samples, 4) Apply iterative pruning to remove noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer, 5) Fine-tune pruned network on reliable data with PDE constraints.

Result: P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to 96.6% reduction in relative error compared to baseline PINNs in extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: Activation-level post hoc pruning is a promising mechanism for enhancing reliability of physics-informed learning in noise-contaminated settings, providing a lightweight post-processing alternative to complete retraining.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising framework for solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data and physical constraints in a unified optimization objective. However, the ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes them highly sensitive to noise. Even a small fraction of corrupted observations can distort internal neural representations, severely impairing accuracy and destabilizing training. Motivated by recent advances in machine unlearning and structured network pruning, we propose P-PINN, a selective pruning framework designed to unlearn the influence of corrupted data in a pretrained PINN. Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining. Numerical experiments on extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks demonstrate that P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to a 96.6\% reduction in relative error compared with baseline PINNs. These results indicate that activation-level post hoc pruning is a promising mechanism for enhancing the reliability of physics-informed learning in noise-contaminated settings.

### [527] [Discrete Diffusion Models Exploit Asymmetry to Solve Lookahead Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19980)
*Itamar Trainin,Shauli Ravfogel,Omri Abend,Amir Feder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAR models (like Discrete Diffusion Models) outperform AR models on planning tasks requiring multi-step lookahead by leveraging reverse deterministic generation, achieving perfect accuracy with exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate why AR Transformers struggle with planning tasks requiring multi-step lookahead, and explore how NAR models might have inherent advantages due to asymmetry in planning problems where reverse generation is deterministic while forward generation requires complex lookahead.

Method: Compare AR vs NAR models (Discrete Diffusion Models) on lookahead planning tasks. Analyze training and inference dynamics through mechanistic analysis. Study how models handle the asymmetry where forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching points but reverse generation is deterministic.

Result: Both AR and NAR models achieve perfect accuracy on lookahead tasks. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures. AR models often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments. NAR models solve planning by using future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding complex traversal mechanisms.

Conclusion: NAR models have fundamental advantages over AR models for planning tasks due to their ability to leverage deterministic reverse generation, making them more sample-efficient and architecturally simpler while achieving comparable performance.

Abstract: While Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based Generative Language Models are frequently employed for lookahead tasks, recent research suggests a potential discrepancy in their ability to perform planning tasks that require multi-step lookahead. In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of time-to-event counterfactual survival prediction, aiming to optimize individualized survival outcomes in the presence of heterogeneity and censored data. We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries degrading model accuracy.

Formulate neighbor selection as optimization problem minimizing global loss under security/privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses DFL's critical challenges by integrating Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration through analytical characterization of trade-offs and distributed GNN-RL decision making.

Abstract: Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.

*Yuxing Tian,Yiyan Qi,Fengran Mo,Weixu Zhang,Jian Guo,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a semi-supervised framework for dynamic graph anomaly detection that learns discriminative boundaries from normal/unlabeled data while leveraging limited labeled anomalies without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DGAD methods face challenges: unsupervised methods produce ambiguous boundaries, while semi-supervised methods overfit to limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. There's a gap in learning discriminative boundaries from normal/unlabeled data while effectively using limited labeled anomalies when available.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Residual representation encoding to capture deviations between current interactions and historical context; 2) Restriction loss that constrains normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres; 3) Bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns discriminative boundaries using normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by normalizing flow.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the framework across diverse evaluation settings, showing effectiveness, generalizability, and model-agnostic properties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the DGAD challenge by learning discriminative boundaries from normal/unlabeled data while leveraging limited labeled anomalies without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is critical for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.

*Nicolas Anguita,Francesco Locatello,Andrew M. Saxe,Marco Mondelli,Flavia Mancini,Samuel Lippl,Clementine Domine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops an analytical theory of pretraining-fine-tuning in diagonal linear networks, identifying four distinct fine-tuning regimes based on initialization choices that affect feature learning and reuse capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the importance of feature learning in pretraining and fine-tuning stages, there's a lack of end-to-end theoretical understanding of how initialization choices impact feature reuse and refinement during fine-tuning.

Method: Developed analytical theory using diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for generalization error as functions of initialization parameters and task statistics.

Result: Identified four distinct fine-tuning regimes based on initialization choices, showing that smaller initialization scales in earlier layers enable both feature reuse and refinement, leading to superior generalization on tasks relying on subsets of pretraining features.

Conclusion: Initialization parameters interact with data to shape fine-tuning generalization, with relative scale across layers playing crucial role in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning, with empirical validation on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Pretraining and fine-tuning are central stages in modern machine learning systems. In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning.

TL;DR: A kernel method for generative modeling using stochastic interpolants, replacing neural networks with linear systems for training-free generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient generative modeling approach that avoids expensive neural network training while maintaining sample quality, enabling training-free generation and model combination.

Method: Uses stochastic interpolant framework with kernel method where the drift is computed via linear systems (P×P system independent of data dimension d). Handles optimal diffusion coefficient with specialized integrator that manages divergence at t=0. Supports diverse feature maps including scattering transforms and pretrained models.

Result: Demonstrated successful application on financial time series, turbulence data, and image generation tasks, showing the method's effectiveness across different domains.

Conclusion: The kernel-based stochastic interpolant framework provides an efficient alternative to neural network training for generative modeling, enabling training-free generation, model combination, and handling of optimal diffusion coefficients with specialized integration methods.

Abstract: We develop a kernel method for generative modeling within the stochastic interpolant framework, replacing neural network training with linear systems. The drift of the generative SDE is $\hat b_t(x) = \nablaφ(x)^\topη_t$, where $η_t\in\R^P$ solves a $P\times P$ system computable from data, with $P$ independent of the data dimension $d$. Since estimates are inexact, the diffusion coefficient $D_t$ affects sample quality; the optimal $D_t^*$ from Girsanov diverges at $t=0$, but this poses no difficulty and we develop an integrator that handles it seamlessly. The framework accommodates diverse feature maps -- scattering transforms, pretrained generative models etc. -- enabling training-free generation and model combination. We demonstrate the approach on financial time series, turbulence, and image generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BarrierSteer is a novel safety framework that embeds Control Barrier Functions in LLM latent space to detect and prevent unsafe responses during inference without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have state-of-the-art performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation, especially in high-stakes settings. Current safety mechanisms need both practical effectiveness and theoretical rigor.

Method: BarrierSteer formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. It uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) as a steering mechanism to detect/prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference, enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging without modifying LLM parameters.

Result: Theoretical results establish that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient safety enforcement approach. Experiments across multiple models and datasets show BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: BarrierSteer provides an effective safety framework that preserves LLM capabilities while offering rigorous theoretical foundations and practical safety improvements against adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

*Ezra Edelman,Surbhi Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves the gap between distribution-aware and distribution-agnostic online learning in the adversarial injection model, proving an Ω(√T) lower bound for VC dimension 1 and introducing a potential-based framework with robust witnesses that achieves improved bounds using inference and certificate dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed a significant gap: distribution-aware algorithms achieve O(d² log T) error while distribution-agnostic ones only achieve Õ(√T) for restricted classes. The paper aims to determine whether this gap is fundamental and to develop better distribution-agnostic algorithms.

Method: Introduces a potential-based framework driven by "robust witnesses" - small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. Instantiates this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) inference dimension, and (2) certificate dimension (a new relaxation introduced in the paper).

Result: Proves a matching Ω(√T) lower bound for VC dimension 1, establishing a sharp separation between distribution-aware and distribution-agnostic regimes. Shows that halfspaces in ℝ² have certificate dimension 3, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of Õ(T^{2/3}) for this class.

Conclusion: The paper resolves the fundamental gap question by proving the Ω(√T) lower bound is tight. The robust witness framework provides a general approach for distribution-agnostic learning in adversarial injection settings, with certificate dimension offering improved bounds for specific classes like halfspaces.

Abstract: We study online learning in the adversarial injection model introduced by [Goel et al. 2017], where a stream of labeled examples is predominantly drawn i.i.d.\ from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$, but may be interspersed with adversarially chosen instances without the learner knowing which rounds are adversarial. Crucially, labels are always consistent with a fixed target concept (the clean-label setting). The learner is additionally allowed to abstain from predicting, and the total error counts the mistakes whenever the learner decides to predict and incorrect abstentions when it abstains on i.i.d.\ rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, prior work shows that oracle access to the underlying distribution yields $O(d^2 \log T)$ combined error for VC dimension $d$, while distribution-agnostic algorithms achieve only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for restricted classes, leaving open whether this gap is fundamental.
  We resolve this question by proving a matching $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension $1$, establishing a sharp separation between the two information regimes. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a potential-based framework driven by \emph{robust witnesses}, small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. We instantiate this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) \emph{inference dimension}, yielding combined error $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ for classes of inference dimension $k$, and (2) \emph{certificate dimension}, a new relaxation we introduce. As an application, we show that halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension $3$, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for this class. This is notable since [Blum et al. 2021] showed halfspaces are not robustly learnable under clean-label attacks without abstention.

*Wendi Li,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAD replaces reward maximization with distribution matching to prevent overfitting and improve reasoning diversity in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL objectives for large-model reasoning focus on maximizing expected rewards, which leads to overfitting to dominant reward signals and neglects alternative valid reasoning trajectories, limiting diversity and exploration.

Method: Introduces Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. Derives a practical LAD objective as minimizing an f-divergence between policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions, yielding gradient updates that increase likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth.

Result: LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO, scales naturally to LLM post-training, faithfully recovers multimodal advantage distributions in bandit settings, and improves both accuracy and generative diversity on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones.

Conclusion: LAD provides an effective alternative to reward maximization that prevents overfitting, maintains diversity, and improves reasoning performance without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.
