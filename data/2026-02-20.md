TL;DR: A Gaussian Splatting-based digital twin method for 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure that improves upon traditional 2D damage identification and photogrammetric 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to move beyond traditional 2D image-based damage identification to precise 3D damage visualization on digital twins for civil infrastructure inspections. Current photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques have limitations compared to modern approaches like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Develops a Gaussian Splatting-enabled digital twin method with three key components: 1) GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing errors, 2) multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail, 3) capability for digital twin updates as damage evolves over time.

Result: Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, showing promising results for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian Splatting-based approach offers an effective solution for 3D damage visualization in digital twins, addressing limitations of traditional methods and enabling better infrastructure inspection and monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.

### [2] [Analytic Score Optimization for Multi Dimension Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16856)
*Boda Lin,Yongjie Zhu,Wenyu Qin,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraVQA dataset with multi-dimensional quality annotations (5 dimensions) and Analytic Score Optimization (ASO) method for improved video quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Quality Assessment needs to evolve beyond single-number scores to richer, multi-faceted evaluations that capture different aspects of video quality like motion, aesthetics, content, and clarity.

Method: Created UltraVQA dataset with 5 quality dimensions annotated by human raters with GPT-generated rationales. Introduced Analytic Score Optimization (ASO) - a theoretically grounded post-training objective that reframes quality assessment as regularized decision-making with closed-form solution.

Result: Method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations combined with reinforcement-based alignment are important for advancing video quality assessment beyond traditional single-score approaches.

Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is evolving beyond single-number mean opinion score toward richer, multi-faceted evaluations of video content. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment.

### [3] [DODO: Discrete OCR Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16872)
*Sean Man,Roy Ganz,Roi Ronen,Shahar Tsiper,Shai Mazor,Niv Nayman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DODO is a Vision-Language Model that uses block discrete diffusion for faster OCR, achieving near SOTA accuracy with 3x speedup over autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for OCR use slow autoregressive decoding that requires sequential forward passes for each token, making them inefficient for long documents. OCR is deterministic (visual input dictates unique output), theoretically enabling parallel decoding via diffusion models.

Method: DODO uses block discrete diffusion instead of autoregressive decoding. It decomposes generation into blocks to mitigate synchronization errors that occur in global diffusion models, making diffusion suitable for OCR's exact-match requirements.

Result: Achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.

Conclusion: Block discrete diffusion successfully unlocks the speedup potential of diffusion models for OCR tasks, overcoming the limitations of both autoregressive decoding and existing masked diffusion approaches.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.

### [4] [StereoAdapter-2: Globally Structure-Consistent Underwater Stereo Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16915)
*Zeyu Ren,Xiang Li,Yiran Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoAdapter-2 improves underwater stereo depth estimation by replacing ConvGRU with ConvSS2D for efficient long-range propagation and creating a large synthetic dataset UW-StereoDepth-80K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater stereo depth estimation suffers from severe domain shifts due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and refraction. Existing GRU-based approaches require multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless regions.

Method: Proposes StereoAdapter-2 with ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models, using four-directional scanning aligned with epipolar geometry. Creates UW-StereoDepth-80K synthetic dataset via semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Uses dynamic LoRA adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance: 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvement on SQUID benchmarks. Real-world validation on BlueROV2 platform demonstrates robustness.

Conclusion: The ConvSS2D operator enables efficient long-range spatial propagation in single update step with linear complexity, combined with large-scale synthetic data and dynamic LoRA adaptation, significantly improves underwater stereo depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is fundamental to underwater robotic perception, yet suffers from severe domain shifts caused by wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and refraction. Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

### [5] [SemCovNet: Towards Fair and Semantic Coverage-Aware Learning for Underrepresented Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16917)
*Sakib Ahammed,Xia Cui,Xinqi Fan,Wenqi Lu,Moi Hoon Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemCovNet addresses Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI) - a bias in semantic representations - using descriptor maps, attention modulation, and alignment loss to achieve fairer vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision datasets suffer from Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), where semantic representations are long-tailed, causing models to poorly learn rare but meaningful semantics. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level and affects model reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet) with three key components: 1) Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, 2) Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and 3) Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss to align visual features with descriptor semantics.

Result: SemCovNet substantially reduces the Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), a metric measuring alignment between coverage and error. The model enhances reliability and achieves fairer, more equitable performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning. The proposed approach addresses semantic-level imbalances that traditional class imbalance methods overlook.

Abstract: Modern vision models increasingly rely on rich semantic representations that extend beyond class labels to include descriptive concepts and contextual attributes. However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Freight vehicles need reliable detection and motion estimation at signalized intersections to enable effective Freight Signal Priority (FSP) control strategies.

Method: Hybrid sensing architecture with intersection-mounted and midblock subsystems using LiDAR and cameras, with clustering-based and deep learning detection methods, Kalman filter tracking, and geodetic registration for lane-level localization.

Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies.

The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.

### [8] [HS-3D-NeRF: 3D Surface and Hyperspectral Reconstruction From Stationary Hyperspectral Images Using Multi-Channel NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16950)
*Kibon Ku,Talukder Z. Jubery,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Baskar Ganapathysubramanian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSI-SC-NeRF: A stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction of agricultural produce using object rotation instead of camera movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction is essential for agricultural quality assessment and phenotyping, but conventional approaches require complex hardware setups incompatible with automated systems. Current NeRF methods need moving cameras, limiting throughput in indoor agricultural environments.

Method: HSI-SC-NeRF uses a stationary camera while objects rotate within a Teflon imaging chamber with diffuse illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco markers and transformed to camera reference frame. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands using composite spectral loss, with two-stage training separating geometric initialization from radiometric refinement.

Result: Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming suitability for automated agricultural workflows.

Conclusion: HSI-SC-NeRF enables high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction for postharvest inspection using stationary cameras, overcoming limitations of moving-camera setups and making the technology compatible with automated agricultural systems.

Abstract: Advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate, high-throughput characterization of agricultural produce quality and plant phenotypes, both essential for advancing agricultural sustainability and breeding programs. HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.

### [9] [DDiT: Dynamic Patch Scheduling for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16968)
*Dahye Kim,Deepti Ghadiyaram,Raghudeep Gadde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic tokenization for Diffusion Transformers that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and denoising timestep, achieving up to 3.5x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs achieve state-of-the-art performance but are computationally expensive due to fixed tokenization using constant-sized patches throughout denoising, regardless of content complexity.

Method: Dynamic tokenization strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and denoising timestep - early timesteps use coarser patches for global structure, later iterations use finer patches for local details.

Result: Achieves up to 3.52× speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and 3.2× speedup on Wan 2.1 without compromising generation quality and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Dynamic tokenization substantially reduces computational cost while preserving perceptual generation quality, making DiTs more efficient for image and video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\times$ and $3.2\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.

### [10] [Characterizing the Predictive Impact of Modalities with Supervised Latent-Variable Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16979)
*Divyam Madaan,Sumit Chopra,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRIMO is a supervised latent-variable imputation model that handles missing modalities in multimodal learning by modeling missing modalities as latent variables, enabling use of all training examples and quantifying predictive impact of missing modalities at instance level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete due to missing modalities, asynchronous collection, or partial availability. Existing MLLMs assume full modality availability during training and inference, which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where modalities may be missing.

Method: PRIMO models missing modalities through latent variables that capture relationships with observed modalities in prediction context. It uses all available training examples (complete or partial). During inference, it samples from learned distribution over missing modality to obtain marginal predictive distribution and analyze modality impact.

Result: PRIMO achieves performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing, and comparable to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. It successfully quantifies predictive impact of modalities at instance level using variance-based metrics from latent completions.

Conclusion: PRIMO provides an effective approach for handling missing modalities in multimodal learning, enabling robust performance across varying modality availability while quantifying uncertainty and modality importance at the instance level.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing approaches predominantly assume the availability of multiple modalities during training and inference. In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.

### [11] [Patch-Based Spatial Authorship Attribution in Human-Robot Collaborative Paintings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17030)
*Eric Chen,Patricia Alves-Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution in human-robot collaborative painting achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy using forensic analysis of 15 abstract paintings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes more involved in creative production, documenting authorship is critical for artists, collectors, and legal contexts, especially in human-robot collaborative artworks.

Method: Patch-based framework using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation to attribute authorship at spatial patch level in human-robot collaborative paintings.

Result: Achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). Conditional Shannon entropy shows hybrid regions have 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings.

Conclusion: The model successfully detects mixed authorship in collaborative artworks and provides methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows, with potential to extend to any human-robot collaborative painting.

Abstract: As agentic AI becomes increasingly involved in creative production, documenting authorship has become critical for artists, collectors, and legal contexts. We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting.

*Peize Li,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework for single-image 3D generation that integrates an external part database with diffusion transformers to enable precise part-level editing while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-image 3D generation methods struggle with long-tail part geometries, multi-view consistency, and limited support for precise localized edits. Learned priors often fail to cover diverse part variations.

Method: PartRAG combines a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns image patches with 3D part latents at part/object granularity, retrieving from 1,236 part-annotated assets. It also includes a masked part-level editor operating in canonical space for localized edits without regenerating entire objects.

Result: Achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO datasets: reduces Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raises F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse. Inference takes 38s with interactive edits in 5-8s. Produces sharper part boundaries and better thin-structure fidelity.

Conclusion: PartRAG successfully addresses challenges in part-level 3D generation by integrating retrieval mechanisms with diffusion models, enabling diverse part generation and precise localized editing while maintaining consistency and quality.

Abstract: Single-image 3D generation with part-level structure remains challenging: learned priors struggle to cover the long tail of part geometries and maintain multi-view consistency, and existing systems provide limited support for precise, localized edits. We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s. Qualitatively, PartRAG produces sharper part boundaries, better thin-structure fidelity, and robust behavior on articulated objects. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PartRAG.

*Chaojie Yang,Tian Li,Yue Zhang,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient compression framework transforms 60-layer MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight Amber-Image models (10B and 6B) with 70% parameter reduction, achieving high-fidelity synthesis without training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformer architectures for Text-to-Image generation suffer from prohibitive computational costs and deployment barriers, creating need for efficient compression methods.

Method: Two-stage compression: 1) Amber-Image-10B via timestep-sensitive depth pruning with layer reinitialization (weight averaging) and layer-wise distillation + fine-tuning; 2) Amber-Image-6B via hybrid-stream architecture converting deep dual streams to single stream initialized from image branch, refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: 70% parameter reduction, <2,000 GPU hours for entire pipeline, matches larger models on DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench with high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering.

Conclusion: Proposed compression framework enables efficient transformation of large T2I models into lightweight variants without training from scratch, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures have significantly advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs and deployment barriers. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench show that Amber-Image achieves high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering, matching much larger models.

*Joongwon Chae,Lihui Luo,Yang Liu,Runming Wang,Dongmei Yu,Zeming Liang,Xi Yuan,Dayan Zhang,Zhenglin Chen,Peiwu Qin,Ilmoon Chae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StructCore replaces max pooling with structure-aware scoring for better anomaly detection by capturing distributional and spatial patterns in anomaly score maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Max pooling discards most information about anomaly evidence distribution and structure, causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap in memory-bank-based UAD.

Method: Computes low-dimensional structural descriptor from anomaly score maps, refines scoring via diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from training samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.

Result: Achieves 99.6% AUROC on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection.

Conclusion: StructCore outperforms max pooling by exploiting structural signatures missed by conventional approaches, improving image-level anomaly detection without additional training.

Abstract: Max pooling is the de facto standard for converting anomaly score maps into image-level decisions in memory-bank-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap.
  We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.
  StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling.

### [15] [Cholec80-port: A Geometrically Consistent Trocar Port Segmentation Dataset for Robust Surgical Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17060)
*Shunsuke Kikuchi,Atsushi Kouno,Hiroki Matsuzaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new trocar port segmentation dataset (Cholec80-port) with geometrically consistent annotations that exclude central openings, improving robustness for surgical vision tasks like 3D reconstruction and SLAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trocar ports in laparoscopic surgery create persistent occlusions and attract disproportionate feature points due to their specular surfaces, which degrade performance of geometry-based pipelines like image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM. Existing datasets lack proper port labels, and current annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central opening.

Method: Created Cholec80-port dataset with high-fidelity trocar port segmentation using a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines port-sleeve masks excluding the central opening. Also cleansed and unified existing public datasets under the same SOP.

Result: Experiments show that geometrically consistent annotations substantially improve cross-dataset robustness beyond what dataset size alone provides.

Conclusion: Proper geometric annotation of trocar ports is crucial for surgical vision tasks, and the proposed dataset and SOP provide a standardized solution that enhances robustness across different datasets.

Abstract: Trocar ports are camera-fixed, pseudo-static structures that can persistently occlude laparoscopic views and attract disproportionate feature points due to specular, textured surfaces. This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP. Experiments demonstrate that geometrically consistent annotations substantially improve cross-dataset robustness beyond what dataset size alone provides.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPL-VAD is a dual-branch framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that combines binary anomaly localization with category classification using cross pseudo labeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection needs to both detect anomalies and identify abnormal categories using only video-level labels, requiring methods that can localize temporal anomalies while recognizing semantic categories.

Method: CPL-VAD uses a dual-branch framework: 1) binary anomaly detection branch for snippet-level anomaly localization, and 2) category classification branch leveraging vision-language alignment for abnormal event category recognition. The two branches exchange pseudo labels to transfer complementary strengths.

Result: Experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and abnormal category classification tasks.

Conclusion: The cross pseudo labeling approach effectively combines temporal precision from the anomaly detection branch with semantic discrimination from the category classification branch, enabling superior weakly supervised video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to detect anomalies and identify abnormal categories with only video-level labels. We propose CPL-VAD, a dual-branch framework with cross pseudo labeling. The binary anomaly detection branch focuses on snippet-level anomaly localization, while the category classification branch leverages vision-language alignment to recognize abnormal event categories. By exchanging pseudo labels, the two branches transfer complementary strengths, combining temporal precision with semantic discrimination. Experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime demonstrate that CPL-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and abnormal category classification.

TL;DR: ComptonUNet is a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust gamma-ray burst localization under low photon statistics and strong background noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faint gamma-ray bursts from distant universe provide insights into early star formation, but detecting and localizing such weak sources is challenging due to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Existing machine learning models struggle to balance statistical robustness and noise suppression.

Method: ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that combines statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. It jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization.

Result: ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios, as demonstrated through realistic simulations of GRB-like events in low-Earth orbit mission environments.

Conclusion: The proposed ComptonUNet framework effectively addresses the challenges of detecting and localizing faint gamma-ray bursts by balancing statistical robustness with noise suppression, offering improved performance for high-energy astrophysical research.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.

*Chi-Shiang Gau,Konstantinos D. Polyzos,Athanasios Bacharis,Saketh Madhuvarasu,Tara Javidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing (like automotive radar) with 3D Gaussian Splatting to overcome limitations of vision-only approaches in adverse conditions like bad weather, low light, or occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based 3D Gaussian Splatting requires many camera views and struggles in adverse conditions (bad weather, low light, occlusions). RF signals are robust to these conditions, motivating their integration for more reliable 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: A multimodal framework combining RF sensing (automotive radar) with Gaussian Splatting. Uses sparse RF-based depth measurements to efficiently predict depth and generate high-quality 3D point clouds for initializing Gaussian functions across various GS architectures.

Result: Numerical tests show the approach achieves high-fidelity 3D scene rendering with RF-informed structural accuracy, demonstrating the benefits of integrating RF sensing into GS pipelines.

Conclusion: RF-Gaussian Splatting integration provides a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering, enabling reliable 3D scene reconstruction in challenging conditions where visual cues are unreliable.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.

*Hiromichi Kamata,Samuel Arthur Munro,Fuminori Homma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: B³-Seg is a fast, training-free Bayesian method for open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation that uses sequential Beta-Bernoulli updates and active view selection via Expected Information Gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS segmentation methods require predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency interactive editing in film and game production.

Method: Reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). The Bayesian formulation guarantees adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, enabling a greedy (1-1/e) approximation to optimal view sampling.

Result: Achieves competitive results compared to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: B³-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency, addressing the need for camera-free and training-free segmentation in real-time editing applications.

Abstract: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation is essential for real-time editing of pre-reconstructed assets in film and game production. However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy. Experiments on multiple datasets show that B$^3$-Seg achieves competitive results to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds. The results demonstrate that B$^3$-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency.

### [20] [BadCLIP++: Stealthy and Persistent Backdoors in Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17168)
*Siyuan Liang,Yongcheng Jing,Yingjie Wang,Jiaxing Huang,Ee-chien Chang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadCLIP++ is a stealthy and persistent backdoor attack framework for multimodal contrastive learning models that uses semantic-fusion QR micro-triggers and stabilization techniques to maintain high attack success rates even under strong defenses and low poisoning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning due to cross-modal inconsistency exposing triggers and gradient dilution at low poisoning rates accelerating backdoor forgetting. These coupled challenges need better modeling and solutions.

Method: 1) Semantic-fusion QR micro-triggers embedded near task-relevant regions for stealthiness; 2) Target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates; 3) Stabilization via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment for trigger embeddings; 4) Curvature control and elastic weight consolidation for model parameter stability; 5) Theoretical analysis showing gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional within trust regions.

Result: With only 0.3% poisoning, achieves 99.99% ASR in digital settings (11.4 points above baselines). Across 19 defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with <0.8% clean accuracy drop. Achieves 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.

Conclusion: BadCLIP++ effectively addresses stealthiness and persistence challenges in multimodal backdoor attacks through unified trigger design and stabilization techniques, demonstrating strong performance under various defensive scenarios with minimal poisoning rates.

Abstract: Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRGS-SLAM: A monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy using 3D Gaussian Splatting with deformation-aware representation and Bayesian self-supervision to handle soft-tissue deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating coupling ambiguity between camera motion and tissue deformation. Existing monocular non-rigid SLAM methods lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse/low-fidelity representations, leading to tracking drift and poor reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes NRGS-SLAM with: 1) Deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map where each Gaussian primitive has learnable deformation probability optimized via Bayesian self-supervision; 2) Deformable tracking module with coarse-to-fine pose estimation prioritizing low-deformation regions; 3) Deformable mapping module for progressive map expansion/refinement; 4) Unified robust geometric loss incorporating external geometric priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets show NRGS-SLAM achieves up to 50% reduction in RMSE for camera pose estimation and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies validate key design choices.

Conclusion: NRGS-SLAM effectively addresses the coupling ambiguity in endoscopic non-rigid SLAM through deformation-aware 3D Gaussian representation and Bayesian self-supervision, achieving superior tracking accuracy and reconstruction quality without requiring external non-rigidity labels.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is a fundamental capability for autonomous perception and navigation. However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

*Seulbi Lee,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric to measure visual grounding in LVLMs, and uses it for selective training to reduce language bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from language bias, producing answers without visual evidence. Existing methods lack quantitative measures of how much training samples or tokens benefit from images.

Method: Introduces Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric measuring reduction in prediction uncertainty from visual input. Proposes VIG-guided selective training that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens.

Result: VIG enables fine-grained analysis at sample/token levels, highlighting visually grounded elements. Selective training improves visual grounding, mitigates language bias, and achieves superior performance with reduced supervision.

Conclusion: VIG provides quantitative measurement of visual grounding, enabling more efficient training by focusing on visually informative content, leading to better visual-language alignment in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.

TL;DR: EntropyPrune uses matrix entropy to identify optimal pruning layers and prune visual tokens in MLLMs, achieving 68.2% FLOP reduction while preserving 96% performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM token pruning methods rely on heuristic, static layer selection which lacks interpretability and transferability across models, limiting effective acceleration.

Method: Introduces matrix-entropy perspective to identify "Entropy Collapse Layer" (ECL) where visual representation information drops sharply. Uses spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices for efficient entropy computation, enabling principled token pruning without attention maps.

Result: Achieves 68.2% FLOP reduction on LLaVA-1.5-7B while preserving 96.0% original performance. Outperforms SOTA pruning methods in accuracy and efficiency, generalizes to high-resolution and video models with up to 64x theoretical speedup.

Conclusion: EntropyPrune provides a principled, interpretable framework for MLLM token pruning that offers strong robustness, scalability, and significant computational savings while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) incur substantial inference cost due to the processing of hundreds of visual tokens per image. Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an "Entropy Collapse Layer" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/YahongWang1/EntropyPrune.

*Ye Zhu,Kaleb S. Newman,Johannes F. Lutzeyer,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GASS enhances text-to-image diversity by controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent variation through geometric decomposition in CLIP embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models lack diversity in generated images from the same prompt, restricting user choice and potentially amplifying societal biases.

Method: Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) decomposes CLIP embeddings into orthogonal directions: text embedding (prompt-dependent) and identified orthogonal direction (prompt-independent). It increases geometric projection spread along both axes and guides sampling via expanded predictions.

Result: Effective disentangled diversity enhancement across different T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: GASS provides a geometric approach to enhance T2I diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent variation sources.

Abstract: Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.

*Yiming Xu,Yi Yang,Hao Cheng,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMAP is a tracking-free trajectory prediction framework for autonomous driving that uses historical occupancy maps instead of object tracking, maintaining reliability when MOT fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion forecasting methods rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, which fails during occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, degrading prediction quality and increasing safety risks.

Method: HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps, uses a historical query module to retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations, summarizes with temporal map embedding, and employs a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories.

Result: On Argoverse 2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods without IDs, outperforms strong baselines in no-tracking setting with 11% FDE, 12% ADE improvements, and 4% MR reduction over fine-tuned QCNet, providing stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously.

Conclusion: HiMAP offers a robust tracking-free alternative for motion forecasting that maintains reliability under MOT failures, serves as a practical fallback for safety-critical autonomy, and supports streaming inference with reusable encodings.

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for autonomous driving, yet most predictors rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, assuming that objects are correctly and continuously tracked. When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\% in FDE, 12\% in ADE, and a 4\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy. The code is available under: https://github.com/XuYiMing83/HiMAP.

*Alireza Hamoudzadeh,Valeria Belloni,Roberta Ravanelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaEarth Embeddings can guide DL models for surface height mapping, with U-Net++ showing better generalization than U-Net despite distribution shift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether geospatial and multimodal features in Earth Embeddings can effectively guide deep learning regression models for regional surface height mapping, using AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10m resolution.

Method: Used AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10m spatial resolution as input, with U-Net and U-Net++ architectures as lightweight convolutional decoders to translate embeddings into surface height estimates, evaluated against high-quality Digital Surface Model (DSM) reference data.

Result: Both architectures achieved strong training performance (R² = 0.97), but test performance decreased due to distribution shifts. U-Net++ showed better generalization (R² = 0.84, median difference = -2.62m) than standard U-Net (R² = 0.78, median difference = -7.22m), though testing RMSE (~16m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight generalization challenges.

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Embeddings show promising potential for guiding DL-based height mapping workflows, especially when combined with spatially aware convolutional architectures like U-Net++, but bias issues need addressing for improved regional transferability.

Abstract: This study investigates whether the geospatial and multimodal features encoded in \textit{Earth Embeddings} can effectively guide deep learning (DL) regression models for regional surface height mapping. In particular, we focused on AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10 m spatial resolution and evaluated their capability to support terrain height inference using a high-quality Digital Surface Model (DSM) as reference. U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns. Overall, the results demonstrate the promising potential of AlphaEarth Embeddings to guide DL-based height mapping workflows, particularly when combined with spatially aware convolutional architectures, while emphasizing the need to address bias for improved regional transferability.

TL;DR: EA-Swin is an Embedding-Agnostic Swin Transformer that detects AI-generated videos by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings, achieving 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators and outperforming prior methods by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent foundation video generators (Sora2, Veo3, etc.) produce highly realistic synthetic videos that expose limitations of existing detection methods, which rely on shallow embedding trajectories, image-based adaptation, or computationally heavy MLLMs.

Method: EA-Swin uses a factorized windowed attention design to model spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings, making it compatible with generic ViT-style patch-based encoders. The authors also construct the EA-Video dataset (130K videos) covering diverse commercial and open-source generators with unseen-generator splits for cross-distribution evaluation.

Result: EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions.

Conclusion: EA-Swin establishes a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection, addressing the limitations of existing methods and demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation video generators such as Sora2, Veo3, and other commercial systems have produced highly realistic synthetic videos, exposing the limitations of existing detection methods that rely on shallow embedding trajectories, image-based adaptation, or computationally heavy MLLMs. We propose EA-Swin, an Embedding-Agnostic Swin Transformer that models spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings via a factorized windowed attention design, making it compatible with generic ViT-style patch-based encoders. Alongside the model, we construct the EA-Video dataset, a benchmark dataset comprising 130K videos that integrates newly collected samples with curated existing datasets, covering diverse commercial and open-source generators and including unseen-generator splits for rigorous cross-distribution evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: PESTGAN: Physics-encoded GAN for tropical cyclone image super-resolution that incorporates atmospheric physics laws into deep learning for better structural and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning super-resolution methods treat satellite image sequences as generic videos, ignoring the underlying atmospheric physical laws that govern cloud motion in tropical cyclones.

Method: Proposed PESTGAN with disentangled generator architecture incorporating PhyCell module that approximates vorticity equation via constrained convolutions, encoding physical dynamics as implicit latent representations. Also uses dual-discriminator framework with temporal discriminator for motion consistency alongside spatial realism.

Result: Experiments on Digital Typhoon dataset for 4× upscaling show better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. Maintains competitive pixel-wise accuracy while significantly excelling in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity.

Conclusion: Incorporating atmospheric physics laws into deep learning super-resolution for tropical cyclone imagery improves physical plausibility and structural fidelity while maintaining accuracy, making it more suitable for meteorological applications.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is indispensable for tracking the genesis, intensification, and trajectory of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, existing deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often treat satellite image sequences as generic videos, neglecting the underlying atmospheric physical laws governing cloud motion. To address this, we propose a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN) for TC image super-resolution. Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures. Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity.

*Dennis N. Schneider,Lars Wagner,Daniel Rueckert,Dirk Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction in colorectal surgery by encoding tissue-anatomy relationships, reducing uncertainty through local reference frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal surgeries are complex, lengthy, and underrepresented in autonomous surgery research, yet offer repetitive tissue manipulation patterns ideal for machine learning-driven automation.

Method: Introduce attachment anchors - structured representations encoding local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and anatomical attachments. These normalize surgical scenes into consistent local reference frames and can be predicted from laparoscopic images.

Result: Experiments on 90 colorectal surgeries show attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction over image-only baselines, with particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings (unseen procedures and surgeons).

Conclusion: Attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery, especially valuable for generalization across different procedures and surgeons.

Abstract: Accurate grasping point prediction is a key challenge for autonomous tissue manipulation in minimally invasive surgery, particularly in complex and variable procedures such as colorectal interventions. Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.

*Mohamed Dhouib,Davide Buscaldi,Sonia Vanier,Aymen Shabou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images using two auxiliary networks and a generation pipeline, improving detection performance on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based methods for generating tampered documents produce limited variety and poor visual quality with visible artifacts, which don't match real-world manipulations and lead to poor generalization in detection models.

Method: 1) Train first auxiliary network using contrastive learning with novel positive/negative pair strategy to compare text crops. 2) Train second auxiliary network to evaluate crop boundaries around characters. 3) Use both networks in a carefully designed generation pipeline to produce diverse, high-quality tampered document images.

Result: Models trained on datasets generated using the proposed method consistently outperform those trained on existing approaches across various architectures and datasets, showing improved generalization to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed data generation pipeline produces more realistic tampered document images that enable training of more robust and generalizable tampered text detection models.

Abstract: Detecting tampered text in document images is a challenging task due to data scarcity. To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets.

### [31] [Polaffini: A feature-based approach for robust affine and polyaffine image registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17337)
*Antoine Legouhy,Cosimo Campo,Ross Callaghan,Hojjat Azadbakht,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polaffini is a feature-based medical image registration framework that uses deep learning segmentation models to extract anatomical centroids as correspondences, enabling efficient polyaffine transformations with diffeomorphic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intensity-based registration methods rely on surrogate alignment measures, while feature-based approaches with explicit anatomical correspondences are theoretically more desirable but have been challenging due to feature extraction difficulties. Recent advances in deep learning segmentation models now enable reliable anatomical delineations that can be leveraged for anatomically-grounded registration.

Method: Polaffini uses pre-trained segmentation models to obtain fine-grained anatomical delineations, extracts centroids from these segmented regions as anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence, and uses these for efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. The method produces transformations ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness, embedded in the log-Euclidean framework to ensure diffeomorphic properties.

Result: Polaffini outperforms competing intensity-based registration methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialization for downstream non-linear registration. The framework is fast, robust, and accurate.

Conclusion: Polaffini demonstrates that recent advances in deep learning segmentation can be effectively leveraged to create anatomically-grounded registration algorithms that are well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines, offering advantages over traditional intensity-based approaches.

Abstract: In this work we present Polaffini, a robust and versatile framework for anatomically grounded registration. Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.

*Yuchang Jiang,Anton Raichuk,Xiaoye Tong,Vivien Sainte Fare Garnot,Daniel Ortiz-Gonzalo,Dan Morris,Konrad Schindler,Jan Dirk Wegner,Maxim Neumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America reveals 11M hectares of tree crops, 23% linked to 2000-2020 deforestation, and exposes flaws in EUDR regulatory maps that misclassify smallholder agroforestry as forest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring tree crop expansion is crucial for zero-deforestation policies like EUDR, but current efforts are hindered by lack of high-resolution data that can distinguish diverse agricultural systems from forests.

Method: Multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series to create first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America.

Result: Identified approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, with 23% linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Revealed that existing EUDR regulatory maps often misclassify established agriculture (especially smallholder agroforestry) as "forest".

Conclusion: The high-resolution baseline map mitigates risks of false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers, supporting more effective, inclusive, and equitable conservation policies.

Abstract: Monitoring tree crop expansion is vital for zero-deforestation policies like the European Union's Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR). However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.

### [33] [DRetHTR: Linear-Time Decoder-Only Retentive Network for Handwritten Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17387)
*Changhun Kim,Martin Mayr,Thomas Gorges,Fei Wu,Mathias Seuret,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRetHTR is a decoder-only HTR model using Retentive Networks instead of Transformers, achieving Transformer-level accuracy with 1.6-1.9x faster inference and 38-42% less memory by eliminating the growing KV cache problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in HTR suffer from growing key-value cache during decoding, making inference slow and memory-intensive. The paper aims to address this fundamental limitation while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Replaces Transformer's softmax attention with RetNet's softmax-free retention mechanism, injects multi-scale sequential priors, and introduces layer-wise gamma scaling to progressively enlarge retention horizon across layers (short-range in early layers, broader context in later layers).

Result: Achieves 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory than equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, with best reported test character error rates: 2.26% (IAM-A), 1.81% (RIMES), 3.46% (Bentham), and competitive 4.21% (READ-2016).

Conclusion: Decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency, demonstrating a practical solution to the KV cache problem in HTR systems.

Abstract: State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.

*Lorenzo Caselli,Marco Mistretta,Simone Magistri,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralGCD is an efficient multimodal approach for Generalized Category Discovery that uses CLIP cross-modal similarities as unified representations, anchors learning to explicit semantic concepts, and employs spectral filtering and knowledge distillation to maintain semantic quality while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods either overfit to known classes when using parametric classifiers on image features alone, or are computationally expensive when using multimodal approaches that treat modalities independently. There's a need for an efficient multimodal approach that effectively leverages cross-modal information without high computational overhead.

Method: Uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as unified representations; expresses images as mixtures over semantic concepts from a task-agnostic dictionary; introduces Spectral Filtering that uses cross-modal covariance matrix from teacher model to retain only relevant concepts; employs forward and reverse knowledge distillation from same teacher to maintain semantic sufficiency and alignment.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks while operating at a fraction of the computational cost of existing approaches.

Conclusion: SpectralGCD provides an efficient and effective multimodal solution for Generalized Category Discovery that maintains semantic quality through spectral filtering and knowledge distillation, offering superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD.

### [35] [When Vision Overrides Language: Evaluating and Mitigating Counterfactual Failures in VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659)
*Yu Fang,Yuchun Feng,Dong Jing,Jiaqi Liu,Yue Yang,Zhenyu Wei,Daniel Szafir,Mingyu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLAs often fail to follow language instructions when lacking scene-specific supervision, acting based on visual shortcuts from training biases. The paper introduces a counterfactual benchmark (LIBERO-CF) and proposes Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG) to improve language conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models frequently exhibit counterfactual failures - they ignore language instructions and rely on visual shortcuts from dataset biases, executing well-learned behaviors regardless of language intent. This undermines their ability to faithfully follow language instructions.

Method: 1) Introduces LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible layouts. 2) Proposes Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a dual-branch inference scheme combining a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action module for counterfactual comparison during action selection.

Result: CAG improves language following accuracy by 9.7% and task success by 3.6% on under-observed tasks using training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5% when paired with VA model. Real-world evaluations show 9.4% reduction in counterfactual failures and 17.2% average improvement in task success.

Conclusion: Counterfactual failures are prevalent but underexplored in VLAs. CAG provides a simple, plug-and-play solution that improves language conditioning without additional demonstrations or architectural changes, enhancing robustness on under-observed tasks across diverse VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.

TL;DR: EAGLE is a tuning-free framework that uses expert model outputs to guide MLLMs for industrial anomaly detection, improving accuracy and providing interpretable descriptions without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial anomaly detection methods often produce only binary decisions with limited explanations, while MLLMs can provide detailed analyses but require costly fine-tuning and don't consistently outperform lightweight specialist detectors.

Method: EAGLE integrates outputs from expert models to guide MLLMs toward accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions without fine-tuning. It also examines attention distribution in MLLM intermediate layers to understand how attention aligns with anomalous regions.

Result: EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets. Successful detection correlates with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions.

Conclusion: EAGLE provides an effective tuning-free approach for industrial anomaly detection that combines the accuracy of expert models with the interpretability of MLLMs, offering both detection and semantic explanations without costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is important for smart manufacturing, but many deep learning approaches produce only binary decisions and provide limited semantic explanations. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for deformable surgical scene reconstruction rely on fixed viewpoints, stereo depth, or accurate structure-from-motion, limiting their applicability to real clinical settings with monocular sequences and large camera motion.

Method: Progressive window-based global representation with local deformable scene models; coarse-to-fine strategy using multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors; long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public endoscopic datasets in appearance quality and geometry; ablation studies validate key design effectiveness.

Conclusion: Local-EndoGS enables high-quality 4D reconstruction from monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion, addressing limitations of existing methods for real clinical applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing deformable surgical scenes from endoscopic videos is challenging and clinically important. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/Local-EndoGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models struggle with 2D quantum material characterization due to subtle layer-dependent contrast, limited labeled data, and poor generalization across different labs and imaging setups. Existing approaches lack physical priors and cannot adapt to new materials or hardware conditions.

Method: Four-part framework: 1) Synthia - physics-based synthetic data generator simulating optical responses under thin-film interference; 2) QMat-Instruct - large-scale multimodal instruction dataset with physics-informed QA pairs; 3) QuPAINT - Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning with Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors; 4) QF-Bench - comprehensive benchmark for standardized evaluation.

Result: The framework addresses data scarcity through synthetic generation, enables multimodal understanding through instruction tuning, incorporates physical priors for robust representations, and establishes standardized evaluation protocols for reproducible research.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware multimodal framework provides a comprehensive solution for 2D quantum material characterization that overcomes limitations of existing vision models by integrating physical knowledge, synthetic data generation, and standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Characterizing two-dimensional quantum materials from optical microscopy images is challenging due to the subtle layer-dependent contrast, limited labeled data, and significant variation across laboratories and imaging setups. Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes. Then, we propose Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning (QuPAINT), a multimodal architecture that incorporates a Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors, enabling more robust and discriminative flake representations. Finally, we establish QF-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple materials, substrates, and imaging settings, offering standardized protocols for fair and reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training and improving performance on sophisticated image edits.

Abstract: Image Copy Detection (ICD) aims to identify manipulated content between image pairs through robust feature representation learning. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods.

TL;DR: AR pipeline for laparoscopic liver surgery uses depth maps + foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose, replaces FE-based deformation with NICP, achieving 9.91mm mean error with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR registration for laparoscopic liver surgery depends on organ contours and complex FE-based deformable models, requiring significant engineering expertise and modeling complexity.

Method: Integrates laparoscopic depth maps with foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation, replaces FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to simplify the pipeline.

Result: On real patient data: depth-augmented foundation pose achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases; rigid-NICP registration outperformed rigid-only registration.

Conclusion: NICP serves as an efficient substitute for FE deformable models, achieving clinically relevant accuracy while offering a lightweight, engineering-friendly alternative to FE-based deformation.

Abstract: Augmented reality can improve tumor localization in laparoscopic liver surgery. Existing registration pipelines typically depend on organ contours; deformable (non-rigid) alignment is often handled with finite-element (FE) models coupled to dimensionality-reduction or machine-learning components. We integrate laparoscopic depth maps with a foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation and replace FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to lower engineering/modeling complexity and expertise requirements. On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases. Combined rigid-NICP registration outperformed rigid-only registration, demonstrating NICP as an efficient substitute for finite-element deformable models. This pipeline achieves clinically relevant accuracy while offering a lightweight, engineering-friendly alternative to FE-based deformation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LATA is a training-free, label-free method that refines medical vision-language model predictions using graph smoothing and conformal prediction to improve uncertainty calibration under domain shift while maintaining validity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs need reliable uncertainty calibration under domain shifts, but existing conformal prediction methods produce large prediction sets with imbalanced class coverage, especially in few-shot imbalanced scenarios. Naive adaptation breaks exchangeability guarantees.

Method: LATA uses Laplacian-assisted transductive adaptation with image-image k-NN graph smoothing of zero-shot probabilities via CCCP mean-field updates. It introduces a failure-aware conformal score within the ViLU framework and preserves SCP validity via deterministic transforms.

Result: Across 3 medical VLMs and 9 downstream tasks, LATA consistently reduces prediction set size and class-conditioned coverage variance while maintaining target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and approaching label-using methods with less compute.

Conclusion: LATA provides an effective, compute-efficient way to improve medical VLM uncertainty calibration under domain shift without breaking exchangeability guarantees, making it practical for real-world deployment where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphThinker: Reinforcement finetuning method that constructs event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to reduce hallucinations in video reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video reasoning requires understanding causal relationships between events, but these are often implicit and costly to annotate. Existing MLLMs lack explicit causal structure modeling, leading to hallucinations during video reasoning.

Method: 1) Constructs event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models intra- and inter-event relations using MLLM. 2) Incorporates scene graphs as intermediate thinking process. 3) Introduces visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning to strengthen video grounding.

Result: Superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization on RexTime and VidHalluc datasets. Reduces hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: GraphThinker effectively reduces hallucinations in video reasoning by explicitly modeling causal structures through event-based scene graphs and enhancing visual grounding via reinforcement finetuning.

Abstract: Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.

*Qiucheng Wu,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Kushal Kafle,Tianyu Wang,Shiyu Chang,Handong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetouchIQ is an RL-based MLLM framework for professional image editing that uses a generalist reward model to evaluate subjective editing quality, enabling executable image adjustments from user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based image editing lacks reliable reward signals for RL training due to the subjective nature of creative editing, making it challenging to evaluate editing quality beyond simple similarity metrics.

Method: RetouchIQ uses MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model (RL fine-tuned MLLM) that evaluates edited results through case-by-case generated metrics, providing scalar feedback for reinforcement learning with instruction-consistent gradients.

Result: RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing.

Conclusion: Generalist reward-driven MLLM agents show potential as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential for extending vision-language reasoning to professional tool-based image editing, enabling intuitive and creative editing. A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.

TL;DR: ArtToMus: First direct artwork-to-music generation framework without text translation, using visual embeddings to condition latent diffusion models for music synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-conditioned music systems are limited to natural photographs and rely on image-to-text conversion, which simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Artworks contain richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content that current systems can't capture.

Method: Created ArtSound dataset (105,884 artwork-music pairs with dual-modality captions). Proposed ArtToMus framework that projects visual embeddings into conditioning space of latent diffusion model for direct artwork-to-music generation without text translation.

Result: Generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs reflecting visual cues of source artworks. Achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence, though absolute alignment scores are lower than text-conditioned systems (expected due to increased difficulty).

Conclusion: Establishes direct visual-to-music generation as distinct research direction, provides resources for multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A geospatial discovery framework combining active learning, meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning to efficiently find hidden targets in resource-constrained environments with sparse ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like environmental monitoring and disaster response face challenges with costly data collection, dynamic environments, and sparse/biased ground truth data, limiting existing learning-based methods. Need efficient sampling strategies under tight resource constraints.

Method: Unified framework integrating active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Two key innovations: 1) concept-weighted uncertainty sampling (uncertainty modulated by learned concept relevance), and 2) relevance-aware meta-batch formation for semantic diversity during online meta-updates.

Result: Tested on real-world PFAS contamination dataset, showing method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data in varying environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses sparse ground truth limitations and enables efficient geospatial discovery in dynamic, resource-constrained settings through concept-guided reasoning and meta-learning.

Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle to preserve fine garment details in unpaired settings and fail to explain how person-garment correspondence emerges in Diffusion Transformers. They don't explicitly enforce person-garment alignment.

Method: Analyzed full 3D attention in DiT-based architectures, revealing that correspondence depends on precise query-key matching. Introduced CORAL with two components: correspondence distillation loss aligning reliable matches with attention, and entropy minimization loss sharpening attention distribution.

Result: CORAL consistently improves over baselines, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate design choices. Proposed VLM-based evaluation protocol better reflects human preference.

Conclusion: Explicit alignment of person-garment correspondence through query-key matching in DiT attention mechanisms significantly improves VTON performance, particularly for preserving fine details in unpaired settings.

Abstract: Existing methods for Virtual Try-On (VTON) often struggle to preserve fine garment details, especially in unpaired settings where accurate person-garment correspondence is required. These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

TL;DR: IntRec is an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions using user feedback through positive/negative memory sets and contrastive alignment, achieving significant accuracy improvements on LVIS benchmarks with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in one-shot manner and cannot refine predictions based on user feedback, making them ineffective for ambiguous queries or scenes with multiple similar objects.

Method: Proposes IntRec with an Intent State (IS) maintaining dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). Uses contrastive alignment function to rank candidates by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones.

Result: On LVIS: 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR (+2.3), CoDet (+3.7), and CAKE (+0.5). On LVIS-Ambiguous: +7.9 AP improvement over baseline after single corrective feedback with <30 ms added latency per interaction.

Conclusion: IntRec enables fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes through interactive refinement, providing substantial retrieval accuracy improvements without additional supervision and minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes remains a challenging task, especially when queries are ambiguous or involve multiple similar objects. Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in a one-shot manner, lacking the ability to refine predictions based on user feedback. To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural network framework trained on visual-spatial objectives matches human 3D shape inference without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at inferring 3D structure from 2D images, but computational methods have consistently fallen short of human performance. The goal is to develop a model that can predict human 3D shape inferences directly from experimental stimuli.

Method: Developed a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data. Models learn to predict spatial information (camera location, visual depth) from multiple images of natural scenes without object-related inductive biases. Used a zero-shot evaluation approach on established 3D perception tasks.

Result: The modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences without task-specific training. Model responses predict fine-grained human behavior including error patterns and reaction times, revealing correspondence between model dynamics and human perception.

Conclusion: Human-level 3D perception can emerge from simple, scalable learning objectives over naturalistic visual-spatial data, suggesting that visual-spatial signals analogous to human sensory cues are sufficient for achieving human-like 3D shape inference.

Abstract: Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page.

Conclusion: OpenEarthAgent successfully bridges the gap in multimodal reasoning for remote sensing by enabling agents to perform structured analytical tasks with explicit reasoning traces across diverse geospatial domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.

TL;DR: MMCAformer integrates macro traffic flow data with micro driving behavior features from Connected Vehicles using cross-attention transformers for improved speed prediction with uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speed prediction methods rely on aggregated macroscopic traffic data but ignore microscopic human driving behaviors that influence traffic dynamics. Connected Vehicle data provides rich driving behavior features that could enhance prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) that uses self-attention for macro traffic flow dependencies and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. Optimized with Student-t negative log-likelihood loss for point-wise prediction and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments on four Florida freeways show MMCAformer outperforms baselines. Adding micro driving behavior features improves prediction accuracy (RMSE, MAE, MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, 10.2%) and reduces uncertainty (predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0%). Hard braking and acceleration frequencies are most influential features, especially under congested conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating micro driving behavior features with macro traffic data significantly enhances speed prediction accuracy and reduces uncertainty, particularly in congested traffic conditions, demonstrating the value of Connected Vehicle data for proactive traffic management.

Abstract: Accurate speed prediction is crucial for proactive traffic management to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.

TL;DR: LLM-based few-shot classification framework predicts electricity price spikes using natural language prompts with system state data, achieving comparable performance to traditional ML models with better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of predicting electricity price spikes in settings with scarce historical data, where traditional supervised machine learning models may underperform due to limited training examples.

Method: Proposes a few-shot classification framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) that aggregates system state information (electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, recent prices) into statistical features formatted as natural-language prompts, which are fed to an LLM along with general instructions to predict spike likelihood with confidence scores.

Result: Using Texas electricity market data, the LLM-based approach achieves performance comparable to supervised ML models (Support Vector Machines and XGBoost), and outperforms them when limited historical data is available, demonstrating better data efficiency.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant potential as data-efficient tools for electricity price spike classification in data-scarce environments, offering an alternative to traditional ML approaches that require extensive training data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.

TL;DR: Hybrid framework predicts secondary crash likelihood using real-time traffic/environmental features without post-crash data, achieving 91% accuracy with low false alarm rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing secondary crash prediction methods rely on post-crash features (crash type, severity) that aren't available in real-time, limiting practical application in active traffic management systems.

Method: Hybrid framework with dynamic spatiotemporal window to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and upstream segments. Includes three models (primary crash model + two secondary crash models) with ensemble learning integrating six ML algorithms and voting-based mechanism.

Result: 91% correct identification of secondary crashes with false alarm rate of 0.20. AUC improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for individual models to 0.952 for hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively predicts secondary crash likelihood using only real-time features, making it practical for active traffic management systems to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts.

Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.

*Karan Bali,Jack Stanley,Praneet Suresh,Danilo Bzdok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies stability of transformer circuits across different training runs, finding middle-layer heads are least stable but most distinct, deeper models show stronger divergence, and weight decay improves stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability research identifies transformer circuits but rarely tests their stability across different training instances. Without this validation, it's unclear if reported circuits are universal or idiosyncratic to specific training runs, limiting confidence in safety-critical applications.

Method: Systematically study stability across refits in transformer language models of various sizes. Quantify layer-by-layer similarity of attention head representations across independently initialized training runs using rigorous experiments.

Result: (1) Middle-layer heads are least stable but most representationally distinct; (2) Deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) Unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important; (4) Weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability; (5) Residual stream is comparatively stable.

Conclusion: Cross-instance robustness of circuits is essential for scalable oversight and white-box monitorability of AI systems. The findings establish stability as a prerequisite for reliable mechanistic interpretability in safety-critical settings.

Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.

### [56] [PETS: A Principled Framework Towards Optimal Trajectory Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16745)
*Zhangyi Liu,Huaizhi Qu,Xiaowei Yin,He Sun,Yanjun Han,Tianlong Chen,Zhun Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETS introduces a principled framework for efficient test-time self-consistency that reduces sampling budgets by 55-75% while achieving perfect self-consistency on GPQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods waste computational resources through uniform allocation of reasoning trajectories. There's a need for sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under limited computational budgets.

Method: PETS uses an optimization framework with a novel self-consistency rate metric. It treats reasoning traces as workers in crowdsourcing, enabling theoretical guarantees. For offline settings, it uses majority-voting-based allocation; for online streaming, it adapts budgets to question difficulty dynamically.

Result: PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation, achieving perfect self-consistency on GPQA while reducing sampling budget by 75% (offline) and 55% (online) compared to uniform allocation.

Conclusion: PETS provides a theoretically grounded, computationally efficient framework for test-time self-consistency that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking in transformers involves delayed transition from memorization to generalization, characterized by low-dimensional confinement in execution subspace with transverse curvature growth preceding generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grokking phenomenon in small algorithmic tasks remains poorly understood, requiring investigation of optimization dynamics and loss-landscape geometry in transformers trained on modular arithmetic.

Method: Geometric analysis using PCA of attention weight trajectories, measurement of commutator defects (non-commutativity of gradient steps), projection onto learned subspace, and causal intervention experiments across different learning rates and hyperparameters.

Result: Training evolves within low-dimensional execution subspace (68-83% variance captured by single PC), curvature grows sharply orthogonal to subspace, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization with power law relationship, motion along learned subspace is necessary for grokking while artificial curvature increase is insufficient.

Conclusion: Grokking reflects escape from metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation, with findings replicating across learning rates, regimes, and random seeds.

Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.

TL;DR: LiveClin is a live medical LLM benchmark built from contemporary case reports to address data contamination and knowledge obsolescence issues in static benchmarks, revealing significant performance gaps between models and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLM evaluation suffers from data contamination (models trained on benchmark data) and knowledge obsolescence (outdated benchmarks), leading to inflated scores that don't reflect real-world clinical performance.

Method: Created LiveClin benchmark using contemporary peer-reviewed case reports updated biannually. Used AI-human workflow with 239 physicians to transform real patient cases into multimodal evaluation scenarios covering the entire clinical pathway. Contains 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions.

Result: Evaluation of 26 models shows top model achieves only 35.7% Case Accuracy. Human experts outperform most models: Chief Physicians achieve highest accuracy, followed by Attending Physicians. Demonstrates significant gap between current LLMs and clinical expertise.

Conclusion: LiveClin provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide medical LLM development toward greater reliability and real-world utility by addressing contamination and obsolescence issues in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility.

*Payel Bhattacharjee,Osvaldo Simeone,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARS proposes an adaptive, margin-aware data augmentation strategy for reward models that focuses on ambiguous preference pairs where the model is uncertain, improving reward modeling performance over uniform augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward modeling is crucial for alignment methods like RLHF and RLAIF, but relies on expensive human-labeled preference data. Existing augmentation methods don't consider the reward model's estimation difficulty, motivating a more targeted approach.

Method: MARS uses adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling that targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. It concentrates augmentation on low-margin (uncertain) preference pairs and iteratively refines training via hard-sample augmentation.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show MARS increases average curvature of loss function, enhances information, and improves conditioning. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.

Conclusion: MARS provides an effective adaptive augmentation strategy that targets reward model uncertainty, offering both theoretical benefits and practical improvements over existing augmentation methods for reward modeling.

Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using attention mechanisms to weight different Wi-Fi routers' contributions in machine learning-based wireless localization, improving accuracy by over 30% compared to benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Wi-Fi localization algorithms fail to properly weight information from different routers during aggregation, leading to suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Traditional weighted triangulation methods inspired the need for differential weighting of router contributions.

Method: Introduces attention mechanisms to routers in machine learning localization architecture, ensuring each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. Incorporates attention layers into standard ML localization framework.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms effectively address the weighting problem in Wi-Fi localization by differentially weighting router contributions, leading to significant accuracy improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.

*Alex Moody,Penina Axelrad,Rebecca Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning approach corrects orbit propagation errors for LEO satellites, extending Gaussian assumption validity for PNT services by addressing atmospheric drag mismodeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites are used for PNT services as alternatives to GNSS, requiring accurate orbit propagation with realistic uncertainty quantification. The Gaussian assumption for uncertainty distribution is often compromised by atmospheric drag mismodeling, limiting propagation accuracy.

Method: Developed machine learning models (time-conditioned neural network and Gaussian Process) that predict argument of latitude error as Gaussian distribution using parameters from single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. The 1D model captures mismodeled drag effects that can be mapped to Cartesian state space.

Result: The learned models successfully correct error growth in argument of latitude for diverse LEO satellites, extending applicability of Gaussian assumption and enabling modeling of errors with corrected mean and covariance. The correction method only updates dominant error dimensions while maintaining physics-based VCM covariance propagation in other dimensions.

Conclusion: The approach extends utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying existing propagator functionality, improving orbit propagation accuracy for LEO satellite PNT services by addressing atmospheric drag mismodeling through machine learning corrections.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.

### [62] [Omitted Variable Bias in Language Models Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16784)
*Victoria Lin,Louis-Philippe Morency,Eli Ben-Michael*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to address unobservable distribution shifts in language models by mapping omitted variable strength to worst-case generalization bounds, improving OOD performance evaluation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models perform well on in-distribution data but show brittle behavior under distribution shifts. Current approaches only address observable shifts, leaving unobservable components that cause omitted variable bias, compromising both evaluation and optimization.

Method: The authors separate distribution shifts into observable and unobservable components. They introduce a framework that maps the strength of omitted variables to bounds on worst-case generalization performance under distribution shift. This framework is applied to both language model evaluation and optimization.

Result: Empirical experiments show that using these bounds provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true OOD performance compared to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and enables inference about omitted variable strength when target distribution labels are available.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the critical limitation of existing methods by accounting for unobservable distribution shifts, offering more robust evaluation and optimization for language models under distribution shift conditions.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, modern language models remain susceptible to distribution shifts, exhibiting brittle behavior when evaluated on data that differs in distribution from their training data. In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a granular time series segmentation method using Weighted Dual Perspective Visibility Graph (WDPVG) to transform time series into graphs, combined with Graph Attention Network (GAT) for node classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series segmentation has received less attention than other TS tasks, and existing deep learning methods are limited by sliding windows with fixed sizes and strides, restricting segmentation granularity.

Method: Transforms time series into graphs using WDPVG to capture hidden structural aspects, then applies Graph Attention Network (GAT) for node classification to identify meaningful segments. Compares different TS-to-graph transformations.

Result: Achieves average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets, outperforms seq2point baseline by 0.05 F1 score, and reduces required training data compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach with GAT effectively addresses limitations of sliding window methods, provides more granular segmentation, and demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets while requiring less training data.

Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCC is a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and improving LLMs' causal reasoning without labeled counterfactual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well on reasoning benchmarks but struggle with counterfactual questions, revealing weaknesses in causal reasoning. Existing methods require labeled counterfactual data which is difficult to produce at scale.

Method: Double Counterfactual Consistency (DCC) - a training-free inference-time method that verifies models' ability to perform causal intervention and counterfactual prediction without labeled data.

Result: DCC effectively evaluates causal reasoning abilities of leading LLMs across various reasoning tasks and interventions. It also serves as a test-time rejection sampling criterion that improves performance across multiple model families.

Conclusion: DCC provides a practical, data-efficient approach to measure and enhance LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities without requiring extensive labeled counterfactual datasets.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning benchmarks, large language models (LLMs) have proven brittle when presented with counterfactual questions, suggesting weaknesses in their causal reasoning ability. While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.

TL;DR: A cost-effective inference pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on IMO math problems using general-purpose models, addressing grader failure through conjecture extraction and context detachment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to solving IMO-level math problems either used custom/unreleased models or required prohibitively expensive large-scale inference on public models (e.g., $3000 per problem). There's a need for a cost-effective solution using general-purpose models.

Method: The pipeline addresses "Cognitive Well" failures (iterative refinement converging to wrong solutions that both solver and grader consider correct) through conjecture extraction. Candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in fresh environments (context detachment).

Result: On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), the pipeline achieves 67.1% performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with average cost of ~$31 per question. This represented state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, more than doubling the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems can be achieved at orders of magnitude lower cost using general-purpose models, by addressing critical failure modes in solver-grader pipelines through novel verification techniques.

Abstract: In the past year, custom and unreleased math reasoning models reached gold medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFFT is a distributional fine-tuning method for diffusion/flow models that uses Conditional Value-at-Risk to control tail behavior for reliability (left tail) and discovery (right tail), with efficient two-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods only maximize expected reward without controlling tail behavior, but tail control is essential: lower tail determines reliability by limiting failures, while upper tail enables discovery of rare high-reward outcomes.

Method: Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT) uses CVaR for tail shaping. It decomposes CVaR optimization into a two-stage procedure: 1) lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization, and 2) single entropy-regularized fine-tuning via a specific pseudo-reward, making it computationally efficient.

Result: TFFT demonstrates effectiveness across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design, achieving CVaR fine-tuning with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: TFFT provides a principled and efficient approach for distributional fine-tuning that enables tail control for both reliability (left-CVaR) and discovery (right-CVaR) applications, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.

*Ammar Kheder,Helmi Toropainen,Wenqing Peng,Samuel Antão,Jia Chen,Zhi-Song Liu,Michael Boy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoFlow is a physics-guided neural network for high-resolution air quality prediction that incorporates topography and wind direction into a vision transformer architecture, achieving significant improvements over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air quality prediction systems need improvement in accuracy and physical consistency. The authors aim to develop a more efficient and accurate model by explicitly embedding physical processes (topography and wind dynamics) that govern pollutant transport and dispersion.

Method: TopoFlow uses a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: 1) topography-aware attention that models terrain-induced flow patterns, and 2) wind-guided patch reordering that aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. The model was trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data from over 1,400 monitoring stations across China.

Result: Achieved PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remained well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold, enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. Performance gains were consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours.

Conclusion: Principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction. TopoFlow demonstrates that explicitly modeling critical physical factors like topography and wind direction leads to substantial performance improvements over both operational systems and pure AI approaches.

Abstract: We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces automated circuit discovery algorithms with provable guarantees using neural network verification, focusing on input domain robustness, robust patching, and minimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior circuit discovery methods lack provable guarantees over continuous input domains, relying on heuristics or approximations. The authors aim to establish a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.

Method: Leverage recent advances in neural network verification to develop automated algorithms that yield circuits with provable guarantees. Focus on three types: input domain robustness, robust patching, and minimality (various notions of succinctness).

Result: The algorithms uncover novel theoretical connections among the three guarantee families. Experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on vision models show substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery by providing algorithms with formal guarantees, addressing limitations of prior heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: *Automated circuit discovery* is a central tool in mechanistic interpretability for identifying the internal components of neural networks responsible for specific behaviors. While prior methods have made significant progress, they typically depend on heuristics or approximations and do not offer provable guarantees over continuous input domains for the resulting circuits. In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.

TL;DR: HiVAE is a hierarchical variational architecture that scales theory of mind reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains, achieving performance improvements on campus navigation but lacking explicit grounding to actual mental states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory of mind approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces, but there's a need to scale ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains for practical applications.

Method: HiVAE uses a three-level hierarchical variational autoencoder architecture inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, applied to a 3,185-node campus navigation task.

Result: The hierarchical structure achieves substantial performance improvements on the campus navigation task, but learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states.

Conclusion: The authors propose self-supervised alignment strategies to address the grounding limitation and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches for theory of mind systems.

Abstract: Theory of mind (ToM) enables AI systems to infer agents' hidden goals and mental states, but existing approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces. We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task. However, we identify a critical limitation: while our hierarchical structure improves prediction, learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states. We propose self-supervised alignment strategies and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches.

### [70] [Learning under noisy supervision is governed by a feedback-truth gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16829)
*Elan Schonfeld,Elias Wisnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A feedback-truth gap emerges when feedback is processed faster than task structure, causing learners to prioritize feedback over truth. This gap appears universally across neural networks and humans, with different regulatory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how learners balance feedback against underlying truth when feedback processing is faster than task structure evaluation, and to examine this phenomenon across different learning systems.

Method: Used a two-timescale model to predict the feedback-truth gap, then tested it across three systems: neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N=292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N=25). Truth was operationally defined in each context.

Result: The feedback-truth gap appeared universally across all systems. Dense neural networks accumulated the gap as memorization, sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it, and humans showed transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d=3.3-3.9).

Conclusion: The feedback-truth gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision, but its consequences depend on the specific regulatory mechanisms employed by each learning system.

Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.

*Zhicheng Zhang,Ziyan Wang,Yali Du,Fei Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VAM (Verbalized Action Masking) improves RL post-training of LLMs by verbalizing action masks in prompts and using iterative action-space pruning to prevent premature collapse into repetitive behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration is a key bottleneck in RL post-training of LLMs, where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors, limiting learning effectiveness.

Method: VAM verbalizes action masks in prompts to enforce output from masked sets, plus iterative action-space pruning that removes valid sampled actions from the mask and resamples under reduced candidate sets until target is sampled or budget exhausted.

Result: VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play (measured by ACPL) over strong baselines in both engine-play and fixed-dataset regimes.

Conclusion: Verbalized masking is a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training, addressing exploration bottlenecks in sparse feedback environments with large action spaces.

Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.

*Hanna Herasimchyk,Robin Labryga,Tomislav Prusina,Sören Laue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves the discrepancy between theoretical predictions of attention collapse onto the first token and practical observations, showing that residual connections prevent this collapse and explaining the U-shaped position bias in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, but the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. There's a discrepancy between theoretical predictions (attention collapse onto first token) and practical observations (no collapse occurs).

Method: Developed a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout that incorporates residual connections. Analyzed causal Transformers at finite depth to prove they induce a U-shaped position bias.

Result: Residual connections prevent attention collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias where attention concentrates on early and late tokens.

Conclusion: The residual-aware theory provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon, resolving the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and practical observations in Transformer position bias.

Abstract: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.

### [73] [Training Large Reasoning Models Efficiently via Progressive Thought Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16839)
*Zeliang Zhang,Xiaodong Liu,Hao Cheng,Hao Sun,Chenliang Xu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive Thought Encoding enables large reasoning models to reason effectively under fixed-size caches by encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vectors, reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models face efficiency barriers in RL training due to long rollouts requiring extensive memory. Existing sliding-window cache strategies disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance.

Method: Progressive Thought Encoding - a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively encodes intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, eliminating need for full-cache rollouts and maintaining constant memory during inference.

Result: Achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average across six mathematical benchmarks, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under same cache budgets.

Conclusion: The method improves reasoning accuracy while making RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

### [74] [What is the Value of Censored Data? An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16842)
*Rachitesh Kumar,Omar Mouchtaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes offline newsvendor problems with censored demand data, showing how to compute exact worst-case regret bounds and revealing that targeted exploration at high inventory levels can enable near-optimal performance despite heavy censoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works assume fully observed demand, but real-world inventory systems often have censored demand data where only sales are observed (demand equals sales when inventory suffices, otherwise equals inventory). This creates fundamental limitations for learning from passive sales data.

Method: Develops a general procedure to compute exact worst-case regret of data-driven inventory policies over all demand distributions. Shows the infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization reduces to finite-dimensional problem, enabling exact characterization for any sample size and censoring levels.

Result: Analysis reveals: 1) Kaplan-Meier policy shows demand censoring fundamentally limits learning from passive data, but small targeted exploration at high inventory levels substantially improves worst-case guarantees; 2) Sales-as-demand heuristic suffers severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates; 3) Point-of-sale information quality critically shapes offline learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper provides exact performance characterization for censored demand settings, showing targeted exploration can overcome fundamental limitations of passive data, while naive sales-as-demand approaches degrade severely. Information system design (recording stockouts vs. only sales) critically impacts offline learning potential.

Abstract: We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.

*Jianliang He,Leda Wang,Siyu Chen,Zhuoran Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-layer neural networks learn modular addition through Fourier features, phase symmetry, and frequency diversification, enabling robust majority voting despite noisy individual neurons. Training dynamics involve lottery ticket mechanisms and competition between frequencies, explaining grokking as a three-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work identified that neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, but didn't explain how these combine into a global solution for modular addition. The authors aim to bridge this gap by providing a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and theoretical explanation of training dynamics.

Method: Formalized a diversification condition with two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. Used gradient flow analysis to prove frequencies compete within each neuron, with winners determined by initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. Applied ODE comparison lemma to formalize competitive landscape and characterized layer-wise phase coupling dynamics.

Result: Proved that phase symmetry and frequency diversification allow networks to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function for modular addition. Phase symmetry enables majority-voting that cancels out noise from individual neurons. Showed features emerge via lottery ticket mechanism under random initialization. Explained grokking as three-stage process: memorization followed by two generalization phases driven by competition between loss minimization and weight decay.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete mechanistic interpretation of how two-layer neural networks solve modular addition through Fourier feature learning, phase symmetry, and frequency diversification. It explains training dynamics via lottery ticket mechanisms and competition, and demystifies grokking as a three-stage process involving memorization and generalization phases.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of how two-layer neural networks learn features to solve the modular addition task. Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the "winner" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay.

*Daniel Durstewitz,Christoph Jürgen Hemmer,Florian Hess,Charlotte Ricarda Doll,Lukas Eisenmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues for adopting a dynamical systems perspective in time series modeling, claiming it offers superior forecasting, long-term statistical prediction, and theoretical insights compared to current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series modeling lacks clarity on real progress despite hype and industrial demand. Time series originate from underlying dynamical systems, and access to governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. The field needs a dynamical systems perspective to advance to the next level.

Method: Proposes dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) - machine learning/AI approaches that infer surrogate models of underlying dynamical systems from data. Reviews central concepts, methods, measures, and models in dynamical systems theory and DSR.

Result: Dynamical systems models offer profound advantages: beyond short-term forecasts, they enable prediction of long-term statistics, provide domain-independent theoretical insights into time series generation mechanisms, inform about performance upper bounds, generalization into unseen regimes (like tipping points), and potential control strategies.

Conclusion: Insights from dynamical systems reconstruction can advance time series modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. The paper concludes with specific suggestions for translating DSR insights into time series modeling.

Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern datasets often contain redundant or low-utility information (ballast) that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational costs without adding analytical value, creating inefficiencies in machine learning pipelines.

Method: Proposes a generalized multimodal framework using entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modeling, and embedding analysis to identify ballast features. Introduces a novel Ballast Score to integrate these signals into a unified cross-modal pruning strategy.

Result: Experimental results show that significant portions of feature space (often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data) can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint.

Conclusion: The framework successfully identifies distinct ballast typologies (statistical, semantic, infrastructural) and provides practical guidance for creating leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines through systematic ballast reduction.

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack sound and complete guarantees for data poisoning attacks during training. There's a need for exact certification of training-time robustness that can provably identify worst-case attacks and bound all possible attacks.

Method: Formulate adversarial data manipulation, model training, and test-time evaluation as a single mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQCP) problem. The framework encodes both gradient-based training dynamics and model evaluation at test time to find global optimum solutions.

Result: Experimental evaluation on small models confirms the approach delivers complete characterization of robustness against data poisoning. Finding the global optimum provably yields worst-case poisoning attacks while simultaneously bounding effectiveness of all possible attacks.

Conclusion: This work presents the first exact certification framework for training-time robustness against data poisoning attacks, providing both sound and complete guarantees through MIQCP formulation.

Motivation: GNNs are crucial in high-stakes domains like drug discovery but suffer from black-box nature and limited trustworthiness. Existing self-explainable GNNs inherit fundamental limitations including the 1-WL expressivity barrier and lack fine-grained interpretability.

Method: Proposes SymGraph, a symbolic framework that replaces continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation. This approach theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier without requiring differentiable optimization.

Result: SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. It delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods.

Conclusion: SymGraph offers a promising approach for scientific discovery and explainable AI by providing both superior expressiveness beyond traditional GNN limitations and enhanced interpretability through symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.

Motivation: Black-box deep neural approaches for molecule generation lack controllability, formal guarantees, and interpretability. The authors aim to address these limitations by introducing symbolic reasoning alongside neural models.

Method: Neuro-symbolic framework with autoregressive neural model proposing scaffolds and interaction signals, combined with CPU-efficient SMT solver that constructs full graphs while enforcing chemical validity, structural rules, and user constraints.

Result: NSGGM delivers strong performance on both unconstrained and constrained generation tasks, matching state-of-the-art generative performance while offering explicit controllability and guarantees. Also introduced Logical-Constraint Molecular Benchmark for evaluating strict rule satisfaction.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic modeling can achieve competitive generative performance while providing the explicit controllability, interpretability, and formal guarantees that pure neural methods lack, making it suitable for workflows requiring verifiable compliance.

Abstract: We challenge black-box purely deep neural approaches for molecules and graph generation, which are limited in controllability and lack formal guarantees. We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Graph Generative Modeling (NSGGM), a neurosymbolic framework that reapproaches molecule generation as a scaffold and interaction learning task with symbolic assembly. An autoregressive neural model proposes scaffolds and refines interaction signals, and a CPU-efficient SMT solver constructs full graphs while enforcing chemical validity, structural rules, and user-specific constraints, yielding molecules that are correct by construction and interpretable control that pure neural methods cannot provide. NSGGM delivers strong performance on both unconstrained generation and constrained generation tasks, demonstrating that neuro-symbolic modeling can match state-of-the-art generative performance while offering explicit controllability and guarantees. To evaluate more nuanced controllability, we also introduce a Logical-Constraint Molecular Benchmark, designed to test strict hard-rule satisfaction in workflows that require explicit, interpretable specifications together with verifiable compliance.

*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit with continuous action space and collision avoidance, achieving near-optimal regret with time-independent coordination costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of decentralized multi-agent coordination in continuous action spaces where collisions yield zero reward, aiming to design communication-free policies with coordination costs independent of time horizon.

Method: Modular protocol that first solves multi-agent coordination via maxima-directed search to seat players on distinct high-value regions, then decouples into N independent single-player Lipschitz bandits.

Result: Achieves near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus T-independent coordination cost, matching single-player rate and extending to general distance-threshold collision models.

Conclusion: First framework providing near-optimal regret guarantees with time-independent coordination costs for decentralized multi-player bandits in continuous action spaces with collision constraints.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit problem over a continuous, Lipschitz-structured action space where hard collisions yield zero reward. Our objective is to design a communication-free policy that maximizes collective reward, with coordination costs that are independent of the time horizon $T$. We propose a modular protocol that first solves the multi-agent coordination problem -- identifying and seating players on distinct high-value regions via a novel maxima-directed search -- and then decouples the problem into $N$ independent single-player Lipschitz bandits. We establish a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus a $T$-independent coordination cost, matching the single-player rate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework providing such guarantees, and it extends to general distance-threshold collision models.

### [83] [A Unified Framework for Locality in Scalable MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16966)
*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes that locality in MARL can be policy-dependent, not just environment-dependent, and provides a novel decomposition framework that reveals a locality-optimality tradeoff with tighter spectral conditions for exponential decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditions for exponential decay in MARL are too conservative because they rely on worst-case environment bounds and ignore the regularizing effect of policies. The authors aim to show that locality can be policy-dependent and develop a more accurate framework.

Method: Proposes a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix H^π that separates environment sensitivity (E^s for state, E^a for action) from policy sensitivity (Π(π)). This leads to a spectral condition ρ(E^s + E^aΠ(π)) < 1 for exponential decay.

Result: The spectral condition is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. The framework reveals that smooth policies (small Π(π)) can induce locality even in strongly action-coupled environments, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff.

Conclusion: Locality in MARL is policy-dependent, not just environment-dependent. The decomposition framework enables analysis of localized block-coordinate policy improvement with guarantees tied to the spectral radius, providing a more accurate understanding of when exponential decay occurs.

Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.

### [84] [Early-Warning Signals of Grokking via Loss-Landscape Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16967)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The commutator defect (non-commuting gradient curvature) serves as a universal early-warning signal for grokking across different tasks, with causal interventions showing it accelerates generalization when amplified and delays/prevents it when suppressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the confinement mechanism behind grokking in modular arithmetic extends to other sequence-learning tasks, specifically investigating whether the commutator defect is a universal precursor to delayed generalization.

Method: Study two sequence-learning benchmarks (SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction) across learning rates, measure commutator defect (curvature from non-commuting gradients), analyze weight-space PCA, and perform causal interventions (amplifying/suppressing non-commutativity).

Result: Commutator defect rises well before generalization with superlinear power law lead times (α≈1.18 for SCAN, ≈1.13 for Dyck), consistent with modular arithmetic. Spectral concentration is not universal but commutator defect is. Amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (~32% on SCAN, ~50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays/prevents it.

Conclusion: The commutator defect is a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers, establishing its necessity across different task families despite varying sensitivity levels.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.

### [85] [Fail-Closed Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16977)
*Zachary Coalson,Beth Sohler,Aiden Gabriel,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a structural weakness in current LLM alignment where refusal mechanisms are "fail-open" - suppressing a single dominant feature via jailbreaks can collapse alignment. They propose "fail-closed" alignment with redundant, independent causal pathways and demonstrate a progressive alignment framework that achieves robust safety against jailbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment has a structural weakness: refusal mechanisms are "fail-open" - they can be bypassed by suppressing a single dominant feature through prompt-based jailbreaks, causing alignment to collapse and leading to unsafe generation.

Method: Propose "fail-closed alignment" as a design principle with redundant, independent causal pathways. Present a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces.

Result: Across four jailbreak attacks, achieved strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality with small computational overhead. Mechanistic analyses confirm models encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously.

Conclusion: Fail-closed alignment provides a principled foundation for robust LLM safety, with empirical support showing that models trained with this method encode multiple independent refusal directions resistant to simultaneous suppression by prompt-based jailbreaks.

Abstract: We identify a structural weakness in current large language model (LLM) alignment: modern refusal mechanisms are fail-open. While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.

### [86] [Discovering Universal Activation Directions for PII Leakage in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16980)
*Leo Marchyok,Zachary Coalson,Sungho Keum,Sooel Son,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniLeak identifies universal activation directions in language models that consistently increase PII leakage when added to hidden states, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation without training data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors like PII leakage are represented in language models' internal structure, despite their rich internal representations.

Method: UniLeak is a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions in residual streams whose linear addition at inference increases PII generation likelihood. It recovers these directions using only self-generated text without training data or groundtruth PII.

Result: Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods, with minimal impact on generation quality.

Conclusion: PII leakage manifests as a latent signal superposition in model representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation through targeted activation direction manipulation.

Abstract: Modern language models exhibit rich internal structure, yet little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors, such as personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, are represented and modulated within their hidden states. We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-path speculative decoding evaluation shows Traversal Verification dominates OT-based methods; delayed tree expansion and neural selector enable OT methods to outperform for first time with 5% higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts in multi-path speculative decoding, but their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear, and OT-based methods have been lagging behind.

Method: Systematic evaluation of verification strategies; proposed delayed tree expansion (drafts partial single path, delays i.i.d. branching point); developed dynamic neural selector that estimates expected block efficiency of OT-based methods from draft and target features.

Result: Traversal Verification dominates consistently; OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near root but miss deeper gains; delayed tree expansion preserves target distribution and improves root-node i.i.d rollouts; neural selector enables OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for first time.

Conclusion: Delayed tree expansion and neural selector allow OT-based verification methods to achieve 5% higher average throughput than Traversal Verification across diverse models, datasets, and sampling settings, marking the first time OT methods outperform.

Abstract: Multi-path speculative decoding accelerates lossless sampling from a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a draft tree of tokens, and then applies a verification algorithm that accepts a subset of these. While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.

*Nikunj Gupta,James Zachary Hare,Jesse Milzman,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGP (Action Graph Policies) is a MARL approach that models action dependencies between agents to enable better coordination through coordination contexts, achieving superior performance on coordination tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Successful decentralized decision-making in multi-agent systems requires not just good individual actions but compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. Current MARL methods struggle with coordination tasks.

Method: Action Graph Policies (AGP) model dependencies among agents' available action choices by constructing "coordination contexts" that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. This creates a more expressive joint policy structure.

Result: AGP achieves 80-95% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25%. Theoretically, AGPs are strictly more expressive than independent policies and can realize more optimal coordinated actions than greedy execution from centralized value-decomposition methods.

Conclusion: AGP provides an effective framework for modeling action dependencies in MARL, enabling better coordination through coordination contexts, and consistently outperforms existing baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Coordinating actions is the most fundamental form of cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a rigorous connection between pathwise and score-function gradient estimators via Malliavin calculus, introduces a unified variance-aware hybrid estimator, and demonstrates significant variance reduction in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation by unifying pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators through Malliavin calculus, addressing the need for better theoretical foundations and variance reduction in gradient estimation.

Method: Shows both gradient estimators arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity, then introduces a unified hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure to achieve minimum variance among unbiased linear combinations.

Result: Achieves 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Provides closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds and reveals challenges with non-stationary optimization landscapes in policy gradient experiments.

Conclusion: Malliavin calculus serves as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide benefits and when they face limitations, with important implications for future work on non-stationary optimization landscapes.

Abstract: We establish a rigorous connection between pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators by showing that both arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity. Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WS-GRPO improves reasoning efficiency in language models by converting terminal rewards into prefix-level continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO suffers from inefficient reasoning and overthinking due to extended deliberation creating relative gains, but controlling this behavior is difficult because length penalties are hard to calibrate and supervision for when to continue/stop is typically unavailable.

Method: WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals indicating when additional continuation is beneficial, converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories.

Result: WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines on reasoning benchmarks, providing theoretical results and empirical validation.

Conclusion: WS-GRPO effectively addresses the overthinking problem in GRPO by providing outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, improving rollout efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery pipelines are typically complex, rigid, and time-consuming. Domain experts spend too much time debugging pipelines and manually annotating data rather than interpreting findings. There's a need to transform these pipelines so experts can focus on insights rather than technical processes.

Method: Uses In-Context Learning (ICL) as an interface for domain experts to automate pipeline parts without AI training expertise. Introduces novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition models for pattern discovery from heterogeneous data. The pipeline is designed for behavioral neuroscience applications studying fear generalization in mice.

Conclusion: ICL provides a suitable interface for domain experts to automate scientific pipelines without compromising performance. The AI-enhanced approach transforms how experts gain insights from experimental data, particularly in behavioral neuroscience applications like PTSD research.

Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.

TL;DR: FATE is an unsupervised framework that uses ensemble forecasting models to detect anomaly precursors by measuring predictive uncertainty, enabling early warnings before anomalies occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are reactive, only identifying anomalies after they occur, lacking proactive early warning capabilities needed for preventive maintenance in industrial, financial, and cybersecurity applications.

Method: FATE uses a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models to predict future values and leverages ensemble disagreement (predictive uncertainty) to detect Precursors-of-Anomaly without requiring ground-truth labels or reconstruction errors.

Result: FATE achieves 19.9 percentage point improvement in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage point improvement in early detection F1 score across five real-world benchmark datasets, outperforming baselines without needing anomaly labels.

Conclusion: FATE provides an effective and practical unsupervised framework for real-time early warning in complex time-series environments by proactively detecting anomaly precursors through ensemble forecasting uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.

Motivation: Traditional hash-based indexing for embedding tables suffers from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality as unique ID volume expands.

Method: Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash uses linear probing with auxiliary tensors and CUDA kernels, implementing configurable probing and active eviction policies to prevent stale embedding inheritance.

Result: Achieves zero collisions for user embeddings, significantly improves item embedding freshness/quality, maintains comparable training QPS and inference latency to existing methods.

Conclusion: MPZCH effectively mitigates embedding collisions while maintaining production-scale efficiency, and has been released as open-source in TorchRec for community use.

Abstract: Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community.

*Akira Sakai,Yuma Ichikawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes sign bit persistence in sub-bit model compression, showing that learned sign matrices are spectrally similar to random initialization signs, with most weights retaining their initial signs. The authors develop sign lock-in theory and propose methods to reduce sign flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In sub-bit model compression where weights are aggressively compressed below 1 bit per weight, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck that limits further compression efficiency. Understanding and controlling sign bit behavior is crucial for improving compression methods.

Method: The authors analyze sign matrices across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, finding they resist low-rank approximation and resemble i.i.d. Rademacher baselines. They develop sign lock-in theory using stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise, then propose gap-based initialization and outward-drift regularization to reduce sign flips.

Result: Most weights retain their initialization signs, with flips occurring primarily through rare near-zero boundary crossings. The number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. The proposed methods reduce effective flip rate to approximately 10^-3 with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.

Conclusion: Sign-pattern randomness in compressed models is largely inherited from initialization rather than learned, enabling sign lock-in theory and practical methods to reduce sign flips for more efficient compression with minimal performance impact.

Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.

*Xiaocai Zhang,Neema Nassir,Milad Haghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDSH-MARL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for multimodal traffic signal control that uses dual-stage hypergraph attention to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and a hybrid action space for adaptive signal timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic signal control focuses too much on vehicle-centric performance and fails to adequately account for multimodal travelers, especially high-occupancy public transportation that needs priority treatment in corridor networks.

Method: STDSH-MARL uses centralized training with decentralized execution, featuring: 1) dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism to model interactions across spatial and temporal hyperedges, 2) hybrid discrete action space to jointly determine signal phase configuration and green duration.

Result: Experiments on corridor networks across five traffic scenarios show STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear public transportation priority benefits, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies confirm all components contribute, with temporal hyperedges being the most influential factor.

Conclusion: STDSH-MARL effectively addresses multimodal traffic signal control by capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies through hypergraph attention and enabling adaptive signal timing, demonstrating superior performance for public transportation priority in corridor networks.

Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdvSynGNN is a robust graph neural network architecture that combines multi-resolution structural synthesis, adversarial propagation, and confidence-guided label refinement to handle structural noise and heterophily in graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks suffer from performance degradation when dealing with structural noise or non-homophilous topologies (heterophily), which are common in real-world graph data.

Method: The framework uses: 1) multi-resolution structural synthesis with contrastive objectives for geometry-sensitive initializations; 2) a transformer backbone with attention mechanisms modulated by learned topological signals to handle heterophily; 3) an integrated adversarial propagation engine with generative and discriminative components; 4) label refinement through residual correction guided by per-node confidence metrics.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides practical implementation protocols for robust deployment of AdvSynGNN in large-scale environments, offering a comprehensive solution for resilient node-level representation learning in challenging graph scenarios.

Abstract: Graph neural networks frequently encounter significant performance degradation when confronted with structural noise or non-homophilous topologies. To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.

### [98] [Adam Improves Muon: Adaptive Moment Estimation with Orthogonalized Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17080)
*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Scheaffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAMO and NAMO-D are new optimizers that integrate orthogonalized momentum (from Muon) with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation, achieving better performance than AdamW and Muon in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like Adam use adaptive moment estimates for stability, while Muon leverages weight matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum. The paper aims to create a principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with Adam-type noise adaptation to get the best of both approaches.

Method: NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality. NAMO-D right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries, enabling neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligning with near block-diagonal Hessian structure.

Result: Both algorithms achieve optimal convergence rates in deterministic settings and adapt to noise levels in stochastic settings. Experiments on GPT-2 pretraining show NAMO and NAMO-D outperform AdamW and Muon, with NAMO-D achieving further gains via clamping hyperparameter.

Conclusion: NAMO and NAMO-D successfully integrate orthogonalized momentum with Adam-type noise adaptation, providing improved optimization for large language models with theoretical guarantees and empirical performance gains.

Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.

### [99] [MeGU: Machine-Guided Unlearning with Target Feature Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17088)
*Haoyu Wang,Zhuo Huang,Xiaolong Wang,Bo Han,Zhiwei Lin,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeGU is a novel machine unlearning framework that uses MLLMs to guide concept-aware re-alignment, enabling selective forgetting while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning approaches suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressive erasing degrades model utility, while conservative strategies leave residual target information. The paper identifies that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, which fundamentally limits current unlearning paradigms.

Method: MeGU leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models to explicitly determine re-alignment directions by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. It encodes inter-class conceptual similarities into a lightweight transition matrix and introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, negative noise suppresses target-specific features while positive noise reinforces remaining associated features.

Result: MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning (leaving residual information) and over-unlearning (degrading model utility). The framework achieves better balance between erasing target data influence and preserving model performance on retained data.

Conclusion: By leveraging MLLMs for concept-aware guidance and introducing coordinated feature noise manipulation, MeGU provides an effective solution to the fundamental trade-off in machine unlearning, enabling precise control over forgetting while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the "Right to be Forgotten" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.

### [100] [Synergizing Transport-Based Generative Models and Latent Geometry for Stochastic Closure Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17089)
*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent flow matching enables fast single-step sampling for stochastic closure models, 100x faster than diffusion models, with explicit/implicit regularization ensuring physical fidelity and topological preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for stochastic closure modeling due to high-quality diverse samples, but their slow iterative sampling is a major drawback. Need faster generative models that maintain physical fidelity for closure modeling applications.

Method: Use flow matching in lower-dimensional latent space for single-step sampling. Compare implicit regularization (joint training) against explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints to control latent space distortion and ensure physical fidelity of closure terms.

Result: Latent flow matching achieves up to two orders of magnitude faster sampling than diffusion models (single-step vs iterative). Both explicit and implicit regularization preserve topological information from the original dynamical system's manifold, enabling effective learning with less training data.

Conclusion: Flow matching in latent space offers superior sampling speed for stochastic closure models while maintaining physical fidelity through regularization, making it more practical than diffusion models for real-time applications requiring fast sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.

### [101] [A Locality Radius Framework for Understanding Relational Inductive Bias in Database Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17092)
*Aadi Joshi,Kavya Bhand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper introduces "locality radius" to measure structural neighborhood needed for schema predictions, showing model performance depends on alignment between task locality radius and GNN aggregation depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs are commonly used for schema-level prediction tasks assuming relational inductive bias helps, it's unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. Need to understand when structural reasoning matters.

Method: Introduce "locality radius" as formal measure of minimum structural neighborhood required for predictions. Conduct controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and other schema tasks with multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks.

Result: Results reveal consistent bias-radius alignment effect - model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth.

Conclusion: Understanding task locality radius helps determine when GNNs and structural reasoning are beneficial for schema-level prediction tasks, providing guidance for architectural choices based on task requirements.

Abstract: Foreign key discovery and related schema-level prediction tasks are often modeled using graph neural networks (GNNs), implicitly assuming that relational inductive bias improves performance. However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.

*Chuiyang Meng,Ming Tang,Vincent W. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLoRG is a federated fine-tuning framework that uses a single low-rank matrix and aggregates its Gram matrix to eliminate aggregation errors and reduce communication overhead, while using Procrustes alignment to minimize decomposition drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated fine-tuning with LoRA faces two challenges: 1) aggregation errors from separately aggregating two low-rank matrices, and 2) decomposition drift when recovering factors from aggregated matrix products due to non-unique matrix decomposition.

Method: FLoRG uses a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning instead of two, aggregates its Gram matrix (matrix of inner products of column vectors), and introduces Procrustes alignment to align decomposed matrices between consecutive rounds for consistent updates.

Result: FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines in downstream task accuracy and reduces communication overhead by up to 2041× across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks.

Conclusion: FLoRG effectively addresses aggregation errors and decomposition drift in federated LoRA fine-tuning, achieving better performance with significantly reduced communication costs through single-matrix design and Procrustes alignment.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HS code prediction is compliance-critical for global trade, with frequent updates and ambiguous product descriptions causing classification errors that lead to shipment delays and financial losses. Need for scalable, cost-effective ML operationalization.

Method: Serverless MLOps framework orchestrating complete ML lifecycle via event-driven pipelines and managed services.

Conclusion: Provides replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics. Architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference while prioritizing deterministic classification with predictable latency.

Abstract: This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics.

TL;DR: i-PhysGaussian combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with implicit Material Point Method integration for stable physical simulation with large time steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators use explicit step-wise updates that are sensitive to time step size and suffer accuracy degradation with high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement.

Method: Couples 3D Gaussian Splatting with implicit Material Point Method integrator, using implicit Newton-type optimization with GMRES solver to minimize momentum-balance residual for end-of-step state.

Result: Maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion in complex dynamic transitions.

Conclusion: The implicit approach significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency in physical simulation.

Abstract: Physical simulation predicts future states of objects based on material properties and external loads, enabling blueprints for both Industry and Engineering to conduct risk management. Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions.

TL;DR: TIFO is a plug-and-play method that addresses distribution shift in time series forecasting by learning stationarity-aware weights over frequency components, suppressing non-stationary frequencies while highlighting stationary ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for nonstationary time series forecasting fail to capture underlying time-evolving structure across samples and don't model complex time structure, leading to poor handling of distribution shift between training and test data.

Method: Proposes Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO) that learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The method operates in frequency space, using Fourier transform to induce eigen-decomposition, and highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones.

Result: Achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Shows 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on ETTm2 dataset. Reduces computational costs by 60-70% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: TIFO effectively mitigates distribution shift in time series forecasting by operating in frequency space, is plug-and-play compatible with various models, and offers both performance improvements and computational efficiency gains.

Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.

TL;DR: VP-VAE decouples representation learning from discretization by replacing quantization with structured latent perturbations, eliminating codebook collapse issues in VQ-VAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAEs suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization, which hinders effective generative modeling.

Method: VP-VAE eliminates explicit codebooks during training and replaces non-differentiable quantizers with distribution-consistent, scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Also introduces FSP variant for fixed quantizers.

Result: Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks show improved reconstruction fidelity, substantially more balanced token usage, and avoidance of instability inherent to coupled codebook training.

Conclusion: VP-VAE provides a stable alternative to VQ-VAEs by decoupling representation learning from discretization through latent perturbations, with FSP offering theoretical explanation and practical improvement for fixed quantizers.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.

Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, but early risk detection is limited by current diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound is non-invasive and widely available but contains untapped prognostic information about vascular damage.

Method: Machine learning framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust, biologically plausible features and uses explainable AI to interpret findings.

Result: High vascular damage scores stratify individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models like SCORE2. Model features are strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities.

Conclusion: Routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. The approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.

### [110] [When More Experts Hurt: Underfitting in Multi-Expert Learning to Defer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17144)
*Shuqi Liu,Yuzhou Cao,Lei Feng,Bo An,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-expert Learning to Defer faces inherent underfitting due to expert identifiability issues, unlike single-expert L2D. Proposed PiCCE method adaptively identifies reliable experts to reduce multi-expert to single-expert-like problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-expert Learning to Defer is fundamentally more challenging than single-expert case due to inherent underfitting problems. Existing remedies fail because they don't address the core issue of identifying which expert to trust from a diverse pool.

Method: Proposed PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert) - a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. It reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.

Conclusion: Multi-expert L2D has inherent underfitting due to expert identifiability issues. PiCCE effectively addresses this by adaptively identifying reliable experts, resolving multi-expert underfitting and improving prediction performance.

Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.

TL;DR: TimeOmni-VL is a vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through bidirectional mapping between time series and images, using understanding as guidance for high-fidelity generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series modeling suffers from a sharp divide between numerical generation (which relies on superficial pattern matching) and semantic understanding (which struggles with high-fidelity numerical output). While unified multimodal models have bridged this gap in vision, this potential remains untapped for time series.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI) for near-lossless TS2I and I2TS conversions. (2) Understanding-guided generation using a calibrated Chain-of-Thought to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal. Also introduces TSUMM-Suite dataset with six understanding tasks coupled with two generation tasks.

Result: Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.

Conclusion: TimeOmni-VL successfully bridges the gap between time series understanding and generation, demonstrating that vision-centric multimodal approaches can unify these traditionally separate domains and improve performance in both areas.

Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO-Muon: A novel zeroth-order optimization method that combines subspace projection with gradient orthogonalization to significantly improve accuracy and query efficiency for fine-tuning large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order optimization faces a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency - it needs many function evaluations to estimate gradients accurately, which is computationally expensive, especially for large models.

Method: Unifies two principles: (1) projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting low-rank structure of model updates, and (2) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. This forms a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, instantiated as ZO-Muon.

Result: ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Compared to MeZO baseline: requires only 24.7% of queries to reach same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: The proposed ZO-Muon framework successfully addresses the accuracy-query efficiency trade-off in ZO optimization by combining subspace projection with gradient orthogonalization, making ZO optimization more practical for fine-tuning large-scale models.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a gradient-free alternative to first-order (FO) methods by estimating gradients via finite differences of function evaluations, and has recently emerged as a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale models by avoiding backpropagation. However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.

*Xiaohan Zhao,Zhaoyi Li,Yaxin Luo,Jiacheng Cui,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M-Attack-V2 improves black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models by addressing gradient variance issues in local crop matching, using multi-crop alignment, auxiliary target alignment, and patch momentum to boost attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box adversarial attacks on LVLMs are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. Existing transfer-based approaches like M-Attack suffer from high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization.

Method: Reformulates local matching as asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics. Uses Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) to average gradients from multiple local views, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) with semantically correlated auxiliary set for smoother target manifold, and Patch Momentum with refined patch-size ensemble (PE+) to strengthen transferable directions.

Result: Substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosts success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

Conclusion: M-Attack-V2 provides a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that effectively addresses gradient variance issues in local crop matching, significantly improving the effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

TL;DR: A curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control of nonlinear systems with multiple uncertainties, combining DRL with domain randomization and model-based control for efficient sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties is challenging, especially when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intertwined. Existing DRL with domain randomization often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency when handling all uncertainties simultaneously.

Method: A curriculum-based continual learning framework that decomposes complex control problems into sequential learning tasks. The system is extended into a finite set of plants with gradually expanded uncertainties. Combines DRL with a model-based controller (MBC) for baseline performance, using residual learning for task-specific optimization without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Applied to automotive powertrain vibration control, the method achieved robust performance against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, with successful sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles multiple uncertainties in nonlinear systems through sequential learning, maintains stability across tasks, and achieves practical industrial application with efficient sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.

Motivation: Existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW have three major limitations: hard sequence-length cap of 1024, numerical instability in backward pass for small smoothing parameters, and excessive GPU memory consumption from materializing pairwise distance tensors.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution to remove sequence-length constraint, (2) log-space backward pass to prevent floating-point overflow, and (3) fused distance-computation mode that eliminates O(BNM) intermediate distance tensor.

TL;DR: CounterFlowNet uses Generative Flow Networks to generate high-quality counterfactual explanations with sparse edits, handling heterogeneous tabular data while satisfying user constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that are sparse, work with heterogeneous tabular data, and satisfy user-defined constraints.

Method: Formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet), trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function encoding validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity while fully satisfying given constraints.

Conclusion: CounterFlowNet provides an effective generative approach for generating high-quality, sparse counterfactual explanations that handle heterogeneous features and enforce user constraints without retraining.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) provide human-interpretable insights into model's predictions by identifying minimal changes to input features that would alter the model's output. However, existing methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that (1) affect only a small portion of the features, (2) can be applied to tabular data with heterogeneous features, and (3) are consistent with the user-defined constraints. We propose CounterFlowNet, a generative approach that formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet). CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining. Experiments on eight datasets under two evaluation protocols demonstrate that CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity with full satisfaction of the given constraints.

TL;DR: SCOPE framework improves EEG foundation model fine-tuning with limited supervision using structured prototypes and confidence-aware pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG foundation models perform poorly with limited subject-level supervision in clinical settings due to structural mismatch between noisy supervision and highly plastic parameter space.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Learn geometry-regularized task priors, construct balanced class prototypes, generate confidence-aware pseudo-labels to filter unreliable signals; 2) ProAdapter adapts frozen EEG foundation models via lightweight adapter conditioned on structured prototypes.

Result: SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones under label-limited cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively addresses the generalization challenge of EEG foundation models with limited supervision through structured prototype-guided adaptation.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.

TL;DR: A generative modeling framework using Wasserstein Autoencoders learns a differentiable latent interface between laser pulse shaping and electron beam dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of pulse design space without expensive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic exploration of laser pulse shapes in photoinjectors is limited by the high computational cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations needed to optimize electron beam quality for Free-Electron Lasers.

Method: Developed a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent space interface between pulse shaping parameters and downstream beam dynamics. The model learns continuous, interpretable representations from simulated data and generalizes to real experimental measurements.

Result: The learned latent space is continuous, interpretable, and maintains high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families trace coherent trajectories, latent organization correlates with pulse energy, and the geometry enables smooth transitions between pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulation to experimental data.

Conclusion: The approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis by providing a differentiable latent interface for exploring pulse design space.

Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.

TL;DR: RLGT is a new reinforcement learning framework that systematizes previous RL applications in graph theory, supporting various graph types and aiming to facilitate future research in extremal graph theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Wagner and others showed RL can solve extremal graph theory problems, but existing frameworks are fragmented and limited. There's a need for a unified, efficient system that supports diverse graph types (directed/undirected, with/without loops, multi-colored edges) to enable broader RL applications in graph theory.

Method: Developed RLGT (Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory) - a novel RL framework with efficient graph representation, optimized computational performance, and clean modular design. It systematizes previous RL approaches for graph theory and provides support for various graph configurations.

Result: Created a comprehensive RL framework that supports both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and provides a systematic approach for RL applications in extremal graph theory.

Conclusion: RLGT provides a unified, efficient framework that builds on previous RL successes in graph theory, offering better computational performance and broader graph type support to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.

### [121] [Efficient privacy loss accounting for subsampling and random allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17284)
*Vitaly Feldman,Moshe Shenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient method to compute the privacy loss distribution (PLD) for random allocation sampling, showing it matches or beats Poisson sampling for privacy-utility trade-offs, especially in DP-SGD training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random allocation sampling has been used in recent DP optimization and aggregation works but existing analyses have shortcomings: privacy parameters aren't tight due to approximations, and they use hockey stick or Renyi divergence which introduce overheads in privacy accounting.

Method: Develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on PLD realization, enabling efficient computation of PLD for random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm. Extends accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling without manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.

Result: Random allocation's privacy-utility trade-off is at least as good as Poisson subsampling, particularly better suited for DP-SGD training. The PLD of random allocation can be computed efficiently for any DP algorithm.

Conclusion: Random allocation sampling provides practical advantages over Poisson sampling for differentially private applications, with improved privacy accounting through efficient PLD computation and better suitability for DP-SGD training.

Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.

TL;DR: LexiSafe is a lexicographic offline RL framework that prioritizes safety over performance to prevent safety drift in cyber-physical systems, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline safe RL is crucial for CPS where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data is available. Existing methods lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift when balancing reward-safety tradeoffs.

Method: Proposes LexiSafe framework with two variants: LexiSafe-SC (single-cost formulation) and LexiSafe-MC (multiple safety costs). Uses lexicographic prioritization to structurally bias safety over performance, deriving safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds with sample-complexity guarantees.

Result: Empirical results show reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. Theoretical analysis provides sample-complexity guarantees for both single-cost and multi-cost formulations.

Conclusion: LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making by unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, effectively preventing safety drift in offline RL settings.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines.

*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FMAB introduces a new MAB framework where available arms change each round based on previous arm selection, modeled via random graph processes with local movement constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAB assumes fixed arm sets, but real-world scenarios often have dynamically changing available actions constrained by previous choices (e.g., robot navigation, network routing).

Method: Two-phase algorithm: lazy random walk exploration to identify optimal arm, followed by navigation and commitment for exploitation. Analyzed under i.i.d. Erdős–Rényi and Edge-Markovian random graph models.

Result: Established high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. Exploration cost is near-optimal with matching information-theoretic lower bound. Validated with simulations including robotic disaster scenario.

Conclusion: FMAB framework effectively models constrained action availability, with proposed algorithm achieving near-optimal performance and revealing fundamental exploration costs under local-move constraints.

Abstract: We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erdős--Rényi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region.

TL;DR: SubQuad is a scalable pipeline for comparative immune repertoire analysis that combines antigen-aware retrieval, GPU acceleration, multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering to overcome computational and dataset imbalance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes.

Method: SubQuad combines antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. It uses compact MinHash prefiltering to reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups.

Result: On large viral and tumor repertoires, SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity.

Conclusion: By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity.

### [125] [From Subtle to Significant: Prompt-Driven Self-Improving Optimization in Test-Time Graph OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17342)
*Luzhi Wang,Xuanshuo Fu,He Zhang,Chuang Liu,Xiaobao Wang,Hongbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIGOOD is a self-improving graph OOD detection framework that uses prompt optimization and energy preference optimization to amplify OOD signals through iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph OOD detection methods use one-pass inference which prevents progressive correction of erroneous predictions and amplification of OOD signals, limiting their effectiveness in open-world scenarios.

Method: SIGOOD integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training using prompt-enhanced graphs. It generates prompts to amplify OOD signals and optimizes them using Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss that leverages energy variations between original and prompt-enhanced graphs. The system iteratively optimizes prompts in a self-improving loop.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm SIGOOD's effectiveness and outperformance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SIGOOD provides an effective unsupervised framework for graph OOD detection that overcomes limitations of one-pass inference methods by enabling progressive correction and signal amplification through self-improving prompt optimization.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.

### [126] [Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17350)
*Djordje Mihajlovic,Davide Michieletto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how machine learning models use non-topological shortcuts to classify knots, develops a clean dataset to prevent such shortcuts, and provides tools for generating faithful knot embeddings for proper ML training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knot classification is important across multiple scientific fields, and while ML shows promise for solving complex classification tasks, current approaches may rely on non-topological shortcuts rather than learning true topological features.

Method: The authors analyze shortcut methods used by ML models for knot classification, discover hidden non-topological features in existing training data from molecular dynamics simulations, and develop a new dataset and code to generate knot embeddings that properly explore geometric state space while maintaining fixed topology.

Result: The research reveals that ML models can achieve positive classification results by exploiting non-topological features in training data rather than learning true topological properties, leading to the creation of a publicly available dataset and code to address this issue.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous foundation for future ML approaches to knot classification by eliminating shortcut opportunities and enabling faithful exploration of geometric state space, which should accelerate development of models that can solve genuine geometric knot classification challenges.

Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.

*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 2Mamba, an improved linear attention transformer that nearly matches softmax attention accuracy while being more memory efficient for long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention transformers are efficient but less accurate than softmax attention. The goal is to bridge this accuracy gap while maintaining efficiency advantages.

Method: First simplify Mamba-2 to core components (Mamba-2S), then improve the A-mask and increase hidden state order to create 2Mamba. Also investigate elements that help surpass softmax attention.

Result: 2Mamba achieves nearly the same accuracy as softmax attention while being much more memory efficient for long context lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed 2Mamba method successfully bridges the accuracy gap between linear and softmax attention while maintaining memory efficiency advantages for long sequences.

Abstract: Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments

*Justyna Andrys-Olek,Paulina Tworek,Luca Gherardini,Mark W. Ruddock,Mary Jo Kurt,Peter Fitzgerald,Jose Sousa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CACTUS is an explainable ML framework for biomedical data that maintains feature stability under missing data while achieving competitive predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in biomedical domains face limited adoption due to poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under data perturbations like missingness, undermining trust and reproducibility.

Method: CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. It was benchmarked against random forests and gradient boosting methods on a real-world haematuria cohort (568 patients) under controlled missing data scenarios.

Result: CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Feature stability provides complementary information to conventional performance metrics.

Conclusion: Feature stability is essential for assessing ML trustworthiness in biomedical applications. CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support by explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritizing interpretable, stable features.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.

### [129] [MDP Planning as Policy Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17375)
*David Tolpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper frames episodic MDP planning as Bayesian inference over policies, treating policies as latent variables with probabilities proportional to expected returns, and uses variational sequential Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution over optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MDP planning focuses on finding single optimal policies, but there's value in representing uncertainty over optimal behavior. By treating planning as Bayesian inference, the approach captures policy-level uncertainty, which can lead to more robust decision-making and better exploration strategies.

Method: The method treats policies as latent variables with unnormalized probabilities monotone in expected return. It adapts variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) for discrete domains, introducing a sweep operation to enforce policy consistency across revisited states and coupling transition randomness across particles to reduce simulator noise confounding. Acting is done via posterior predictive sampling, which creates a stochastic control policy through Thompson sampling rather than entropy regularization.

Result: The approach was tested across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising domains. Results show that the inferred policy distributions capture meaningful uncertainty over optimal behavior, and the resulting stochastic control policies exhibit qualitative and statistical differences compared to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, particularly in how they handle policy-level uncertainty.

Conclusion: Framing MDP planning as Bayesian inference over policies provides a principled way to represent uncertainty about optimal behavior. The VSMC adaptation effectively approximates policy posteriors, and posterior predictive sampling yields stochastic policies that differ meaningfully from entropy-regularized approaches, offering advantages in exploration and robustness.

Abstract: We cast episodic Markov decision process (MDP) planning as Bayesian inference over _policies_. A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty.

*Afroditi Kolomvaki,Fangshuo Liao,Evan Dramko,Ziyun Guang,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-layer neural network training with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence with error proportional to mask variance, using NTK analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates training scenarios where inputs are partially corrupted or masked, which occurs in practical applications like sensor networks, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning where users may have access to incomplete or noisy features.

Method: Uses Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis to study training dynamics of two-layer ReLU networks with Gaussian randomly masked inputs. A key technical contribution involves handling randomness within non-linear activations.

Result: Demonstrates that training achieves linear convergence up to an error region that scales proportionally with the variance of the Gaussian mask. The analysis provides theoretical guarantees for convergence in noisy input scenarios.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis shows that neural networks can be trained effectively even with randomly masked/corrupted inputs, with convergence guarantees that degrade gracefully with increasing noise/mask variance, supporting practical applications in privacy and federated learning.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence guarantee of two-layer neural network training with Gaussian randomly masked inputs. This scenario corresponds to Gaussian dropout at the input level, or noisy input training common in sensor networks, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning, where each user may have access to partial or corrupted features. Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest.

*Gurjeet Sangra Singh,Frantzeska Lavda,Giangiacomo Mercatali,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models into generative flow matching to learn dynamics from observational data without ground-truth physics parameters, preserving interpretability while matching or outperforming data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models neglect underlying physics, while physics-based models may have missing/unknown terms. There's a need to bridge this gap by integrating incomplete physics knowledge into generative models for interpretable learning of dynamics from observational data.

Method: Integrates incomplete physics models into flow matching framework using structured variational distribution with two latent encodings: one for missing stochasticity/multi-modal velocity, and another for physics parameters with physics-informed prior. Also adapts framework for second-order dynamics.

Result: Method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines on representative ODE/PDE problems while preserving physics model interpretability.

Conclusion: The grey-box approach successfully bridges the gap between black-box generative models and incomplete physics models, enabling interpretable learning of dynamics from observational data without requiring ground-truth physics parameters.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

*Yuma Fujimoto,Kenshi Abe,Kaito Ariu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOGDA with extra optimism accelerates convergence in delayed-feedback bilinear games from exp(-Θ(t/m⁵)) to exp(-Θ(t/(m²log m))).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feedback delays severely degrade multi-agent learning performance, and convergence rates under delayed feedback remain unclear even for fundamental bilinear games.

Method: Analyze Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA) as approximation of Extra Proximal Point (EPP), comparing standard optimism (next-step prediction) vs extra optimism (farther future prediction).

Result: Standard optimism achieves exp(-Θ(t/m⁵)) convergence; extra optimism tolerates larger step sizes and accelerates to exp(-Θ(t/(m²log m))). Experiments confirm accelerated convergence.

Conclusion: Extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays in multi-agent learning.

Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.

### [133] [Learning with Boolean threshold functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17493)
*Veit Elser,Manish Krishan Lal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for training neural networks with strictly ±1 node values and ±1 weights using nonconvex constraint formulation and projection algorithms instead of gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient-based methods struggle with learning in discrete neural systems with Boolean data and binary weights, which are important for interpretability and efficient inference.

Method: Replace loss minimization with nonconvex constraint formulation using Boolean threshold functions (BTFs). Use divide-and-concur decomposition into two constraints: local BTF consistency (enforcing threshold functions with margin bounds) and architectural concurrence (neuron output/downstream input equality and weight consistency). Apply reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm to reconcile constraints.

Result: Achieves exact solutions or strong generalization on tasks including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning where standard gradient methods struggle. Learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks with ±1 weights and simple logical gates when margin bounds are sufficiently large.

Conclusion: Projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.

Abstract: We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.
  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.

*Wen-Tse Chen,Jiayu Chen,Fahim Tajwar,Hao Zhu,Xintong Duan,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Jeff Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RICOL uses LLMs for temporal credit assignment via retrospective in-context learning, achieving high sample efficiency in RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-evolving agents struggle with sparse environmental feedback and poor sample efficiency. Traditional temporal credit assignment methods rely on task-specific value functions that don't generalize well and require many samples.

Method: Proposes RICL (Retrospective In-Context Learning) that leverages pretrained LLMs to transform sparse rewards into dense advantage functions. Then introduces RICOL, an online learning framework that iteratively refines policies based on RICL's credit assignment results.

Result: RICL accurately estimates advantage functions with limited samples and identifies critical states. RICOL achieves comparable performance to traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency across four BabyAI scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for temporal credit assignment, enabling more sample-efficient and generalizable reinforcement learning paradigms.

Abstract: Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRAFT is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition across transformer layers, freezes the resulting factors, and trains only small adaptation matrices, achieving competitive performance with just 41K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor-based PEFT methods either decompose gradient updates (LoTR, SuperLoRA) or apply SVD per layer independently (PiSSA). There's a need to bridge these approaches by performing full Tucker decomposition directly on pre-trained weights organized across layers, enabling more efficient adaptation.

Method: CRAFT applies Tucker tensor decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked as cross-layer 3D tensors. It freezes all resulting Tucker factors and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix, requiring only small square adaptation matrices.

Result: Experiments on GLUE benchmark with RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large show CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters, which is independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.

Conclusion: CRAFT bridges tensor-based PEFT approaches by performing full Tucker decomposition on cross-layer weight tensors, offering an efficient adaptation method with parameter count independent of model size, making it scalable for large transformer models.

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.

TL;DR: radVI is a cheap add-on to existing VI methods that optimizes radial profiles to better capture target distributions, addressing Gaussian limitations in capturing correct radial behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VI methods using Gaussian approximations often fail to capture the correct radial profile of target distributions, leading to poor coverage and approximation quality.

Method: radVI optimizes over radial profiles as an add-on to existing VI schemes (Gaussian VI, Laplace approximation), leveraging Wasserstein space optimization theory and radial transport map regularity properties.

Result: The algorithm provides theoretical convergence guarantees based on recent developments in Wasserstein space optimization and Caffarelli-style radial transport map regularity.

Conclusion: radVI offers an effective, computationally inexpensive enhancement to standard VI methods by addressing radial profile optimization, with solid theoretical foundations.

Abstract: In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $π$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution. However, in many cases of practical interest, Gaussian distributions might not capture the correct radial profile of $π$, resulting in poor coverage. In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).

*Peter Balogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer attention heads in language models function as membership testers that detect whether tokens have appeared before in context, with some heads operating like high-precision filters or classical Bloom filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer attention heads implement membership testing functionality - detecting whether tokens have previously appeared in context - and to characterize the different strategies and capacities of these specialized heads across multiple language models.

Method: Analyzed four language models (GPT-2 small/medium/large, Pythia-160M) to identify membership-testing heads, measured false positive rates across context lengths, fitted Bloom filter capacity curves, performed confound controls to eliminate false positives, and conducted ablation studies to understand functional roles.

Result: Found three genuine membership-testing heads forming a multi-resolution system in early layers (0-1): two high-precision filters with 0-4% false positive rates at 180 tokens, and one classical Bloom filter with 5-bit capacity saturating at ~20 tokens. Heads generalize broadly (43% higher than duplicate-only heads) and contribute to both repeated and novel token processing.

Conclusion: Transformer models develop specialized membership-testing attention heads that form a multi-resolution system with different capacity strategies, distinct from other head types, that generalize broadly and coexist with other computational roles while withstanding rigorous confound controls.

Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.

TL;DR: Efficient algorithm for generating provably cardinally-minimal explanations for Neural Additive Models (NAMs) using only logarithmic verification queries, outperforming existing methods for subset-minimal explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks lack provable guarantees, and finding cardinally-minimal feature subsets is computationally infeasible for standard neural networks due to exponential verification queries.

Method: A model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only logarithmic verification queries in input features, after parallelized preprocessing with logarithmic runtime in precision for each univariate NAM component.

Result: The algorithm makes cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, outperforms existing algorithms for subset-minimal explanations, provides provably smaller explanations, and substantially reduces computation time compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: For Neural Additive Models, efficient generation of provably cardinally-minimal explanations is achievable, offering benefits unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques used to interpret NAMs.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.
  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries
  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.
  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.
  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.

### [139] [Position: Evaluation of ECG Representations Must Be Fixed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17531)
*Zachary Berger,Daniel Prakah-Asante,John Guttag,Collin M. Stultz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current ECG representation learning benchmarks are too narrow, focusing only on arrhythmia labels while ignoring broader clinical applications like structural heart disease and patient forecasting. When proper evaluation practices are applied, random encoders perform as well as state-of-the-art pre-trained models on many tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of ECG representation learning has converged on limited benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) that only cover arrhythmia and waveform morphology, despite ECGs containing much broader clinical information. This narrow focus may mislead progress and fail to align with meaningful clinical objectives.

Method: The paper proposes expanding evaluation to include structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting. It outlines best practices for multi-label, imbalanced evaluation settings and empirically evaluates three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six settings: three standard benchmarks plus structural disease, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting datasets.

Result: When proper evaluation practices are applied, the literature's conclusions about which representations perform best change. Surprisingly, randomly initialized encoders with linear evaluation match state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks, making random encoders a reasonable baseline model.

Conclusion: ECG representation learning needs broader, more clinically meaningful benchmarks and better evaluation practices. The field should expand beyond arrhythmia-focused tasks to include structural disease and forecasting applications, and should use random encoders as baselines to properly assess pre-training benefits.

Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MASPO is a new RLVR framework that addresses limitations in existing methods like GRPO by introducing soft gating, mass-adaptive constraints, and asymmetric risk control to better align with LLM optimization dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms (like GRPO) use rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that don't align well with LLM optimization dynamics. Three key problems are identified: inefficient gradient utilization from hard clipping, insensitive probability mass from uniform ratio constraints, and asymmetric signal reliability from disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive/negative samples.

Method: Proposes Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO) with three components: 1) Differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, 2) Mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across probability spectrum, 3) Asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence.

Result: Extensive evaluations show MASPO significantly outperforms strong baselines and serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution.

Conclusion: MASPO provides a unified framework that harmonizes gradient utilization, probability mass adaptation, and asymmetric signal reliability to create a more effective RLVR approach for LLMs.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

TL;DR: Modular LLM training combines domain experts via robust gating to match monolithic performance without heuristic data weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large generative models is resource-intensive and relies on heuristic dataset weighting. The paper aims to enable modular training of LLMs by combining small domain experts to match monolithic performance robustly for any data mixture.

Method: Theoretical framework for modular generative modeling with pre-trained experts combined via gating functions. Formulates minimax game to find robust gate minimizing divergence to worst-case data mixture. Introduces scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and Structural Distillation for efficient inference.

Result: Proves existence of robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem. Shows modularity acts as strong regularizer with generalization bounds scaling with gate complexity. Proves modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data. Empirical results confirm modular architecture mitigates gradient conflict and outperforms monolithic baselines.

Conclusion: Modular LLM training with robust gating can match or exceed monolithic performance without heuristic data weighting, offering theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency benefits.

Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

TL;DR: EWC-LoRA applies Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization to low-rank adapters for continual learning, maintaining constant storage/inference costs while effectively mitigating task interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight regularization techniques like EWC remain underexplored in parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL) with pre-trained models, despite being key strategies in traditional CL. The paper aims to bridge this gap by revisiting weight regularization in low-rank CL settings.

Method: Proposes EWC-LoRA which regularizes shared low-rank updates through Elastic Weight Consolidation. Uses low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over full-dimensional space, keeping storage and inference costs constant regardless of task count.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show EWC-LoRA achieves superior stability-plasticity trade-off compared to existing low-rank CL approaches, demonstrating weight regularization remains effective even under low-rank parameterizations.

Conclusion: Weight regularization is an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference in parameter-efficient continual learning, providing practical computational- and memory-efficient solutions for CL with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

TL;DR: First theoretical analysis of normalization/scaling impact on Transformer expressivity for time series, showing no single method consistently outperforms others and sometimes no normalization works best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, but their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective.

Method: Proposed novel expressivity framework for time series, derived theoretical bounds for Standard and Min-Max scaling, and conducted empirical validation on classification/forecasting benchmarks with multiple Transformer models.

Result: No single normalization method consistently outperforms others; in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. Choice of normalization significantly influences model's representational capacity depending on task and data characteristics.

Conclusion: Highlights critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivates need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.

*Sharut Gupta,Sanyam Kansal,Stefanie Jegelka,Phillip Isola,Vikas Garg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal contrastive models trained independently on different data/architectures exhibit consistent geometric relationships: their embedding spaces are related by a single orthogonal transformation that simultaneously aligns both image and text encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if independently trained multimodal models share systematic geometric relationships between their representation spaces, especially for cross-modal consistency, which would enable backward-compatible model upgrades and have privacy implications.

Method: Analyze geometric relationships between embedding spaces of independently trained multimodal contrastive models (CLIP, SigLIP, FLAVA) by examining if orthogonal transformations can align their representations, both within and across modalities.

Result: Found that embedding spaces are related by an orthogonal map (up to global mean shift) - a single orthogonal transformation Q simultaneously aligns both image encoders (f̃(x) ≈ Qf(x)) and text encoders (g̃(y) ≈ Qg(y)) across independently trained models.

Conclusion: The discovery of consistent orthogonal relationships enables backward-compatible model upgrades without re-embedding, has privacy implications for learned representations, and reveals fundamental geometric structure in multimodal contrastive learning.

Abstract: As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

*Saveliy Baturin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Overparameterized one-hidden-layer ReLU networks exhibit flatter loss landscapes with vanishing energy gaps between local and global minima as width increases, making sublevel sets connected in the limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the topological properties of loss landscapes in neural networks, particularly how overparameterization affects connectivity between solutions and the existence of optimization barriers.

Method: Theoretical analysis of convex L-Lipschitz losses with ℓ₁-regularized second layers, proving connectivity between models at same loss level and asymptotic bounds on energy gaps. Empirical validation using Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) on synthetic Moons dataset and Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

Result: Proved continuous path connectivity between models with arbitrarily small loss increase; obtained vanishing asymptotic bound on energy gap between local and global minima as width grows. Empirical results show wider networks have smaller energy gaps with permutation test p=0.

Conclusion: Overparameterization flattens loss landscapes and connects sublevel sets in the limit, explaining why wide networks are easier to optimize despite non-convexity.

Abstract: We study the topology of the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks under overparameterization. On the theory side, we (i) prove that for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses with an $\ell_1$-regularized second layer, every pair of models at the same loss level can be connected by a continuous path within an arbitrarily small loss increase $ε$ (extending a known result for the quadratic loss); (ii) obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the energy gap $ε$ between local and global minima that vanishes as the width $m$ grows, implying that the landscape flattens and sublevel sets become connected in the limit. Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM watermarking methods have two critical limitations: lack of principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing that invalidates Type-I error guarantees with early stopping.

Method: Developed Anchored E-Watermarking framework using e-values and test supermartingales for detection process. Leverages anchor distribution to approximate target model, characterizes optimal e-value with respect to worst-case log-growth rate, and derives optimal expected stopping time.

Result: Framework enables valid anytime-inference (unlike traditional approaches), significantly enhances sample efficiency, and reduces average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Anchored E-Watermarking bridges the gap in LLM watermarking by providing a principled framework that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency improvements.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Obaidullah Zaland,Sajib Mistry,Monowar Bhuyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KD-UFSL combines k-anonymity and differential privacy to protect client data in federated split learning while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated split learning reduces client computation but exposes private data through intermediate representations (smashed data) shared with the server, creating privacy risks.

Method: Proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL) that applies microaggregation (k-anonymity) and differential privacy to intermediate representations to minimize data leakage while preserving model utility.

Result: KD-UFSL increases reconstruction error by up to 50% and decreases structural similarity by up to 40% on four datasets, effectively protecting privacy while maintaining global model performance.

Conclusion: KD-UFSL provides an effective privacy-preserving solution for federated split learning that balances privacy and utility, making it suitable for large-scale big data applications.

Abstract: Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.

*Luke Huang,Zhuoyang Zhang,Qinghao Hu,Shang Yang,Song Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCPO stabilizes asynchronous RL for language models by controlling policy-gradient variance through ESS-based learning rate scaling and a minimum-variance baseline, enabling 2.5× faster training while matching synchronous performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous RL training for language models suffers from high variance in policy-gradient estimators due to stale rollouts, causing noisy gradients and unstable learning compared to on-policy training.

Method: VCPO (Variance Controlled Policy Optimization) stabilizes REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms by: (1) scaling learning rate based on effective sample size (ESS) to dampen unreliable updates, and (2) applying a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for off-policy settings without needing auxiliary value models.

Result: VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming various baselines including masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. It reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5× while matching synchronous performance.

Conclusion: Explicit control of policy-gradient variance through ESS-based learning rate scaling and minimum-variance baselines is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale, enabling faster training without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.

*Obaidullah Zaland,Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan,Monowar Bhuyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSI-FL is a one-shot incremental federated learning framework that addresses communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting by using vision-language models to generate embeddings, diffusion models to synthesize data, and selective sample retention to preserve important samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, privacy-sensitive data streams that are challenging to centralize. Federated learning helps with privacy but assumes static data flow and requires multiple communication rounds, making incremental learning difficult in limited-communication scenarios.

Method: OSI-FL uses a frozen vision-language model to generate category-specific embeddings from each client in a single communication round. A pre-trained diffusion model at the server synthesizes new data similar to client distributions. To handle incremental tasks and prevent catastrophic forgetting, they use Selective Sample Retention (SSR) which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category-task pair based on sample loss.

Result: OSI-FL outperforms baselines including traditional and one-shot FL approaches in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: OSI-FL successfully addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting in federated learning with incremental data, providing an effective framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient learning in dynamic data environments.

Abstract: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.

*Nathan S. de Lara,Florian Shkurti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMAC is an offline RL method that learns actor-critics that can smoothly transition to online fine-tuning without performance drops by regularizing Q-functions to connect offline and online maxima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL methods suffer from performance drops when fine-tuning online due to low-performance valleys separating offline and online maxima in the loss landscape.

Method: SMAC regularizes the Q-function during offline training to enforce a first-order derivative equality between the policy score and action-gradient of the Q-function, connecting offline and online maxima.

Result: SMAC achieves smooth transfer to online algorithms (Soft Actor-Critic and TD3) in all 6 D4RL tasks, reducing regret by 34-58% in 4/6 environments compared to baselines.

Conclusion: By connecting offline and online maxima through regularization, SMAC enables effective offline-to-online RL transfer without performance degradation.

Abstract: Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.

### [151] [When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633)
*Shayan Kiyani,Sima Noorani,George Pappas,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes weak-strong verification policies for LLMs, showing optimal policies have two-threshold structure and developing an online algorithm to control acceptance/rejection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM reasoning operates within verification loops where cheap internal checks (weak verification) contrast with expensive user inspection (strong verification). There's a tension between cost and reliability that needs systematic treatment.

Method: Formalizes weak-strong verification policies that decide when to accept/reject based on weak verification vs. defer to strong verification. Introduces metrics for incorrect acceptance, rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Shows optimal policies have two-threshold structure and develops online algorithm with provable error control.

Result: Optimal verification policies admit a two-threshold structure. Calibration and sharpness govern weak verifier value. The online algorithm provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on query stream, language model, or weak verifier.

Conclusion: The framework provides principled approach to balance cheap weak verification with reliable strong verification, enabling systematic error control in LLM reasoning systems through formal verification policies.

Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.

### [152] [Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634)
*Xinghong Fu,Yanhong Li,Georgios Papaioannou,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Small hybrid models with long convolution and linear RNN layers can match large transformer performance for zero-shot time series forecasting while being 100x smaller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series foundation models are large, inefficient, and expensive to use despite scaling being a key driver of performance in other modalities. There's a need for more efficient models that maintain performance.

Method: Use small hybrid models combining long convolution and linear RNN layers (DeltaNet layers) instead of large transformers. Apply data augmentation and inference strategies to improve performance.

Result: The proposed Reverso models match performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than 100 times smaller, significantly improving the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: Large transformers are unnecessary for time series foundation models; small hybrid architectures with proper design can achieve similar zero-shot forecasting performance with dramatically better efficiency.

Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.

*Keith Burghardt,Jienan Liu,Sadman Sakib,Yuning Hao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAMOSE is a novel agentic framework using ReAct paradigm for automated feature engineering that achieves state-of-the-art performance on regression tasks and near state-of-the-art on classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature engineering is a critical bottleneck in ML for tabular data, requiring substantial domain expertise to identify optimal features from an exponentially large feature space.

Method: FAMOSE leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. It's the first application of agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering for both regression and classification tasks.

Result: FAMOSE achieves state-of-the-art for regression tasks (reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average) and is at or near state-of-the-art on classification tasks (ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average for tasks with >10K instances). It's more robust to errors than other algorithms.

Conclusion: The ReAct paradigm allows LLM context window to record iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps, guiding the LLM to invent better features. This work demonstrates AI agents are effective for problems requiring inventive solutions like feature engineering.

Abstract: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.

*Sima Noorani,Shayan Kiyani,Hamed Hassani,George Pappas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework for multiround conversational AI that ensures AI collaboration improves human decision quality through two principles: counterfactual harm (not undermining human strengths) and complementarity (adding value where human errs), with user-defined rules and online algorithm with guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high-stakes decisions, there's a need for principled frameworks to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality rather than degrade it.

Method: Formalizes counterfactual harm and complementarity via user-defined rules, then introduces an online, distribution-free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces user-specified constraints over collaboration dynamics.

Result: The framework was evaluated across two interactive settings: LLM-simulated collaboration on medical diagnosis and human crowdsourcing on pictorial reasoning. The online procedure maintains prescribed violation rates even under nonstationary dynamics, and tightening/loosening constraints produces predictable shifts in human accuracy.

Conclusion: The two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without needing to model or constrain human behavior, providing a principled approach to ensure AI collaboration reliably improves human decision-making.

Abstract: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

### [156] [A New Perspective on Scale: A Novel Transform for NMR Envelope Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16841)
*Ehsun Assadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel transform enables NMR envelope extraction with fewer sampling points than Nyquist rate requires, using a new scale definition based on space-invariant states rather than observable matter/energy characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NMR envelope extraction requires many sampling points to meet Nyquist rate, which is inefficient. The paper challenges conventional scale definitions that lack physical referents in all situations and aims to develop a more efficient envelope detection method.

Method: Introduces a new scale definition based on variations of space-invariant states rather than observable matter/energy characteristics. Distinguishes scale-variant and scale-invariant observers, showing that converting between them is equivalent to envelope extraction. Implements an Earth-field NMR setup to generate real data for evaluation.

Result: The proposed transform enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting Nyquist rate. Performance evaluated using real Earth-field NMR data shows comparison with classic and state-of-the-art methods for NMR signal parameter recovery.

Conclusion: The paper successfully challenges traditional scale definitions and demonstrates a novel transform that enables efficient NMR envelope extraction with reduced sampling requirements, validated through real experimental data from an Earth-field NMR setup.

Abstract: Envelope extraction in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental step for processing the data space generated by this technique. Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals.

TL;DR: End-to-end odor communication model for plant stress signaling using Green Leaf Volatiles (GLV) with transmitter, channel, and receiver components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand plant-plant communication evolution and develop precision farming technologies by modeling stress signaling through volatile organic compounds.

Method: Developed a complete odor communication model with damaged transmitter plant emitting GLVs, time-varying diffusion-advection channel, and biochemical receiver network converting GLVs to defensive metabolites.

Result: (Z)-3-hexenol identified as primary driver of the system; plant perception operates in non-linear region; framework established for understanding plant communication.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive framework for studying plant-plant communication evolution and developing next-generation precision farming technologies based on volatile signaling.

Abstract: This paper develops an end-to-end odor communication model for stress signaling between plants using Green Leaf Volatiles (GLV). A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $β$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region. These findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of plant-plant communication and for developing next-generation precision farming technologies.

TL;DR: BrainRVQ is a novel EEG foundation model that uses dual-domain residual vector quantization to disentangle temporal and spectral patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse EEG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals have low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity, making foundation model development challenging. Existing approaches often miss the hierarchical latent structure of neural dynamics, leading to poor reconstruction of fine-grained information.

Method: Proposes BrainRVQ with Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. Uses hierarchical autoregressive pre-training with coarse-to-fine reconstruction and importance-guided curriculum masking to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets show BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

Conclusion: BrainRVQ provides an effective foundation model for EEG that captures hierarchical neural dynamics through dual-domain quantization and curriculum learning, offering improved performance for various EEG analysis tasks.

Abstract: Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

*Swapnil Saha,Rahul Aggarwal,Fikadu Dagefu,Justin Kong,Jihun Choi,Brian Kim,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper studies covert multi-hop communication in wireless networks against adversaries using cyclostationary detectors, developing optimal resource allocation and routing strategies to maximize covertness or minimize latency under QoS constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of covert communication in wireless networks where adversaries use advanced detection techniques like cyclostationary detectors, requiring sophisticated resource allocation and routing strategies to maintain stealth while ensuring reliable communication.

Method: Uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling for covert routes, formulates optimization problems for maximum end-to-end covertness or minimum latency under QoS and link budget constraints, and shows equivalence between covertness and detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations for efficient route computation.

Result: Numerical simulations reveal: (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with covertness requirements, (ii) latency increase is super-linear with packet size M, and (iii) different detectors (cycle vs. energy) impose distinct latency behaviors based on message length and covertness requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides valuable insights for resource allocation and routing design in covert networks facing advanced detection adversaries, establishing fundamental trade-offs between covertness, latency, and system parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates covert multi-hop communication in wireless networks where an adversary employs a cyclostationary (cycle) detector to reveal hidden transmissions. The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries.

### [160] [Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part I: Traffic-Aware Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17023)
*Yanqing Xu,Zhiguo Ding,Xiu Yin Zhang,Trung Q. Duong,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a traffic-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems, addressing limitations of existing link-level approaches by incorporating spatial traffic statistics and optimizing for network-wide coverage and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing link-level designs for pinching-antenna systems focus on per-user optimization for given user sets, failing to capture network-level requirements like region-wide coverage and location fairness. These approaches require frequent re-optimization as users move, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors.

Method: The paper introduces traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulates two traffic-aware deployment problems: (1) maximizing traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (2) traffic-restricted max-min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. For the network-average objective, they develop a candidate-based global maximization method exploiting unimodality properties. For the max-min objective, they use a block coordinate descent framework with epigraph reformulation and bisection.

Result: Simulations show that the proposed traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a low-complexity, environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems that addresses network-wide coverage and fairness requirements while being robust to user mobility and reducing control overhead.

Abstract: Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This two-part paper develops a network-level design framework for pinching-antenna systems that moves beyond conventional link-level optimization by incorporating environment awareness through traffic statistics and geometry/blockage considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional link-level optimization for pinching-antenna systems is too tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry, making it sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by developing environment-aware network-level optimization approaches.

Method: Part I: Traffic-aware optimization using spatial traffic maps. Part II: Geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization with deterministic LoS visibility indicators and discrete activation architecture. They formulate two network-level activation problems (coverage maximization and worst-grid SNR maximization), prove NP-hardness, develop MILP reformulations, and create scalable coordinate-ascent and bisection-based solvers.

Result: The paper develops mathematical formulations, proves complexity results, and creates efficient algorithms for network-level optimization. Simulation results validate the proposed designs and quantify performance gains under different environments and system parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed environment-aware network-level framework successfully addresses the limitations of conventional link-level optimization by incorporating traffic statistics and geometry/blockage awareness, providing robust solutions that are less sensitive to user mobility and localization errors.

Abstract: This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters.

### [162] [Assessing Ionospheric Scintillation Risk for Direct-to-Cellular Communications using Frequency-Scaled GNSS Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17143)
*Abdollah Masoud Darya,Muhammad Mubasshir Shaikh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper investigates ionospheric scintillation effects on Direct-to-Cellular satellite communications by scaling GNSS L-band observations to D2C frequencies, comparing ground-based and space-based data to characterize spatial/temporal patterns and band-dependent vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ionospheric scintillation significantly degrades Direct-to-Cellular satellite link quality, but there's limited understanding of its spatial/temporal characteristics at D2C frequencies, especially in regions lacking ground monitoring stations.

Method: Scaling L-band scintillation observations from GNSS receivers to D2C bands (low-band, N255, N256), comparing with scaled radio-occultation data from FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission, analyzing 5 years of ground data from UAE and 2 years of space-based data during Solar Cycle 25 ascending phase.

Result: Pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20-22 local time (especially during equinoxes), strong azimuth dependence (southward links most affected), low-band scintillation occurrence more than twice that of N255/N256, occurrence rates increase with solar activity.

Conclusion: GNSS scintillation observations can effectively characterize D2C link impairments, higher D2C bands are more robust to scintillation, and space-based observations provide valuable data for regions lacking ground stations, aiding system design and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: One of the key issues facing Direct-to-Cellular (D2C) satellite communication systems is ionospheric scintillation on the uplink and downlink, which can significantly degrade link quality. This work investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of amplitude scintillation at D2C frequencies by scaling L-band scintillation observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to bands relevant to D2C operation, including the low-band, and 3GPP's N255 and N256. These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A four-layer MEC-enabled NTN architecture with UAVs, HAPS, and LEOSats uses physical-layer authentication to secure task offloading against malicious actors, with joint optimization of offloading decisions and resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote IoT deployments lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, requiring non-terrestrial networks with MEC capabilities. However, malicious actors could drain computing resources, necessitating authentication mechanisms.

Method: Proposed four-layer MEC-enabled NTN: UAVs as access nodes, HAPS as coordinator/authenticator, LEOSats as remote MEC servers. Uses tag-based physical-layer authentication and formulates joint task offloading decision and resource allocation problem solved via block coordinate descent.

Result: PLA scheme is efficient and outperforms benchmark schemes. The proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed four-layer NTN architecture with physical-layer authentication effectively secures task offloading in resource-constrained IoT deployments while maintaining computational efficiency and robustness against attacks.

Abstract: Remote and resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments often lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, motivating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with onboard multiaccess edge computing (MEC) capabilities. Nevertheless, in the presence of malicious actors, authentication needs to be performed to avoid non-authorized nodes from draining the computing resources of the NTN nodes. As a solution, we propose a four-layer MEC-enabled NTN with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as access nodes, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as coordinator and authenticator, and a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) acting as remote MEC servers. We consider a tag-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme to authenticate legitimate users, and formulate a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation for the admitted tasks, which is solved via block coordinate descent. Numerical results show that the PLA scheme is efficient and performs better than the benchmark schemes. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints.

*Luca Antonelli,Antonio Alberto D Amico,Luca Sanguinetti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a near-field grid design for U-MIMO channel estimation that places grid points on a reference plane at arbitrary height, improving accuracy when UEs are primarily ground-based.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing near-field dictionaries provide unnecessary 3D coverage when user equipments are primarily located on the ground, leading to inefficient channel estimation for practical scenarios.

Method: Designs a near-field grid with points lying on a reference plane at arbitrary height relative to the U-MIMO system with uniform planar array, using channel accuracy metric to optimize codebook performance.

Result: When user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency.

Conclusion: The reference-plane-based grid design provides more efficient and accurate channel estimation for near-field U-MIMO systems in practical ground-based UE scenarios, overcoming limitations of traditional far-field angular sampling.

Abstract: Near-field ultra-massive MIMO (U-MIMO) systems provide enhanced spatial resolution but present challenges for channel estimation, particularly when hybrid architectures are employed. Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency.

*Chongjun Ouyang,Hao Jiang,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Signal processing framework for detecting random segment failures in segmented waveguide pinching-antenna systems using tagged pilots and compressive sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to detect random segment failures in segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna systems, requiring per-segment observability and efficient detection methods.

Method: Uses tagged pilots with unique signatures per segment; develops low-complexity per-segment ML detector for long pilots, and compressive sensing-based detector for short pilots exploiting sparsity in failure-indicator vector.

Result: Per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance; compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with short pilots and outperforms baselines requiring longer pilots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects segment failures using tagged pilots, with compressive sensing enabling reliable detection even with limited pilot length.

Abstract: A signal processing-based framework is proposed for detecting random segment failures in segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna systems. To decouple the passively combined uplink signal and to provide per-segment observability, tagged pilots are employed. A simple tag is attached to each segment and is used to apply a known low-rate modulation at the segment feed, which assigns a unique signature to each segment. Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots.

*Rakesh Ranjan,Ahmad Sirojuddin,Manjesh K. Hanawal,Himanshu B. Mishra,Wan-Jen Huang ID*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Robust RIS-assisted MIMO secure communication with practical non-ideal RIS elements (electrical resistance), using adaptive projected gradient method for joint optimization of transmit precoding and RIS phase shifts to maximize secrecy rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RIS research often uses idealized models neglecting practical non-ideal effects like electrical resistance in reflecting elements. This study aims to establish secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links with a more realistic RIS model.

Method: Formulates secrecy rate maximization problem for RIS-assisted MIMO system with practical RIS elements. Uses adaptive projected gradient method (PGM) with adaptive step size initialization and control for joint optimization of transmit precoding matrix and RIS phase shifts. Also introduces simplified variant maximizing channel power difference instead of exact secrecy rate to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Proposed PGM with adaptive step size significantly improves secrecy rate and reduces computational time compared to conventional fixed step size PGM. Simplified approximation yields secrecy rate close to true optimum while substantially reducing computational cost. Practical RIS model proves essential for secure communication, especially under varying RE resistance values.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive PGM framework effectively maximizes secrecy rate in practical RIS-assisted MIMO systems. Adopting realistic RIS models with electrical resistance is crucial for establishing secure communication links, and the simplified approximation provides near-optimal performance with reduced complexity.

Abstract: This study investigates a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for secure wireless communication, in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) sends confidential messages to a multi-antenna receiver (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values.

*Ricardo Carrero,Ruben Garvi,Luis Hernandez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a new model for analyzing quantization noise spectrum using pulse frequency modulation, providing intuitive understanding and practical applications for level crossing ADCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization noise analysis relies heavily on statistical descriptions rather than analytical spectral properties. There's a need for more intuitive understanding of quantization noise spectrum structure.

Method: Establishes equivalence between uniform quantizer and bipolar pulse frequency modulation system, then defines Fourier transform of quantized signal using pulse frequency modulation properties.

Result: Develops a model that provides intuitive understanding of quantization noise spectral structure and complements prior research. The model can be directly applied to level crossing ADCs with zero-order-hold interpolators.

Conclusion: The pulse frequency modulation approach offers a more intuitive framework for understanding quantization noise spectrum and enables accurate performance estimation for level crossing ADCs.

Abstract: Uniform quantization is a topic that has been extensively studied. However and although an analytical description of quantization noise has been proposed, most descriptions of the spectral properties of quantization error resort to statistical descriptions. In this paper, we show how the spectrum of a quantized signal can be expressed using pulse frequency modulation. We first establish the equivalence of a uniform quantizer with a system based on the bipolar pulse frequency modulation and we define afterwards the Fourier transform of the quantized signal using pulse frequency modulation properties. This model brings a more intuitive understanding of the spectral structure of quantization noise and complements prior research in the topic. The results of the paper can be directly applied to level crossing ADCs with zero-order-hold interpolators, giving an accurate estimation of their performance.

### [168] [Neural Implicit Representations for 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17556)
*Nithin Sugavanam,Emre Ertin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Neural implicit surfaces improve 3D SAR imaging by learning signed distance functions from sparse scattering data, outperforming traditional sparsity priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SAR imaging suffers from artifacts due to incomplete Fourier domain sampling, and simple priors like sparsity are insufficient for accurate 3D reconstruction of surface-dominated scattering.

Method: Use neural structures to model surface scattering via learned signed distance functions, regularized by sampling points from implicit surface representations during training to handle sparse noisy data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D SAR imaging results on both measured and simulated data, demonstrating effective representation of target scattering for single vehicles and complex scenes with multiple vehicles.

Conclusion: Neural implicit representations show promise for SAR imaging, with future research needed for complex-valued neural representations to enable new collection synthesis from volumetric models.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.

*Marouan Mizmizi,Zhibin Yu,Guanglong Du,Umberto Spagnolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Paper develops ISAC method using uplink waveforms and hand motion to measure device-body distance for adaptive power control, with autofocus algorithm for trajectory estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current proximity sensors only provide binary detection, causing conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. Measuring exact distance would enable proportional power adjustment to improve throughput while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Method: Device-centric ISAC using uplink communication waveforms for sensing. Exploits natural hand motion to create virtual aperture for angular resolution. Develops autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering to jointly track device trajectory and compensate residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers.

Result: Derives Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed ISAC method enables accurate distance measurement between device and body, allowing for proportional power adjustment that improves throughput while maintaining regulatory compliance, overcoming limitations of binary proximity sensors.

Abstract: Regulatory limits on Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) require handheld devices to reduce transmit power when operated near the user's body. Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age assessment is critical in forensic and judicial contexts, especially for undocumented individuals and minors, but current dental age assessment practices suffer from methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and poor interoperability between systems, which hinders transparency and reproducibility.

Method: Developed with domain experts, the AIdentifyAGE ontology is a domain-specific semantic framework that models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual information, forensic examination data, dental development assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods, building on established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies.

Conclusion: AIdentifyAGE ontology enhances consistency, transparency, and explainability in forensic dental age assessment, establishing a foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying components and their subsequent relationships. We measure the performance by assessing each element of the DSM and overall architecture. Despite design and computational challenges, we identify opportunities for automated DSM generation, with all code publicly available for reproducibility and further feedback from the domain experts.

### [172] [Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716)
*Song-Ju Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-state reuse in adaptive systems inevitably leads to contextuality in classical probabilistic representations, requiring irreducible information-theoretic costs that nonclassical frameworks avoid by relaxing joint probability assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental representational consequences of single-state reuse in adaptive systems, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence but poorly understood. The paper aims to show that contextuality is not unique to quantum mechanics but arises inevitably from single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations.

Method: Model contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state. Prove mathematically that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur irreducible information-theoretic costs. Provide a minimal constructive example to explicitly realize this cost and clarify its operational meaning. Compare with nonclassical probabilistic frameworks.

Result: Contextuality is an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Classical models must incur irreducible information-theoretic costs where dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through internal state. Nonclassical frameworks avoid this by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without needing quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: Contextuality is a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence independent of physical implementation, arising from fundamental limitations of classical probabilistic representations when reusing single internal states across multiple contexts.

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based human mobility simulations have high computational costs that limit scalability for large-scale applications like urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis.

Method: Two-component framework: (1) reasoning component encodes reasoning steps as latent-space embeddings with evaluator for reuse/recombination, (2) decoding component uses lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent reasoning chains to natural language.

Result: MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed cache framework enables efficient large-scale human mobility simulation by leveraging reconstructible caches, addressing the scalability limitations of current LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

TL;DR: Analysis of 60 LLM benchmarks reveals nearly half show saturation, with expert-curated benchmarks resisting saturation better than crowdsourced ones, and hidden test data providing no protective effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI benchmarks become saturated quickly, losing their ability to differentiate between top-performing models, which diminishes their long-term value for measuring progress and guiding deployment decisions.

Method: Analyzed 60 LLM benchmarks from major model developers' technical reports, characterized them along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format, and tested five hypotheses about how each property contributes to saturation rates.

Result: Nearly half of benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Hiding test data (public vs. private) shows no protective effect against saturation.

Conclusion: Benchmark design choices significantly impact longevity; expert curation extends benchmark durability while hidden test data doesn't prevent saturation, providing guidance for creating more durable evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

*Yonatan Gideoni,Sebastian Risi,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Simple baselines match or exceed sophisticated code evolution methods across mathematical bounds, agentic scaffolds, and ML competitions, revealing flaws in current evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate code evolution techniques by comparing them against simpler baselines, as many proposed pipelines show impressive performance but lack proper comparison to basic approaches.

Method: Tested two simple baselines across three domains: mathematical bounds optimization, agentic scaffold design, and machine learning competitions. Analyzed why simple methods perform well and identified shortcomings in current code evolution practices.

Result: Simple baselines matched or exceeded sophisticated code evolution methods in all three domains. For mathematical bounds, search space design and domain knowledge were more important than the evolution pipeline. For agentic scaffolds, high variance and small datasets led to suboptimal selection, making hand-designed majority vote scaffolds best.

Conclusion: Code evolution research needs better evaluation methods, reduced stochasticity, and more rigorous practices. The primary challenge is often search space design rather than the evolution pipeline itself. Proposed improvements for future work include better evaluation protocols and best practices.

Abstract: Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.

### [176] [Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807)
*Duncan Soiffer,Nathaniel Itty,Christopher D. Rosin,Blake Bruell,Mason DiCicco,Gábor N. Sárközy,Ryan Offstein,Daniel Reichman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves the upper bound for slicing all edges of an n-dimensional hypercube with hyperplanes from ⌈5n/6⌉ to ⌈4n/5⌉ (with a slight adjustment for odd multiples of 5).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of finding the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice all edges of an n-dimensional hypercube (Q_n) is a classic combinatorial geometry problem with known bounds dating back to Paterson's 1971 result of S(n) ≤ ⌈5n/6⌉. The authors aim to improve this 50-year-old upper bound.

Method: The authors construct 8 hyperplanes that slice Q_{10} (the 10-dimensional hypercube), then use this construction to prove the general bound. They employ CPro1, an automated tool that combines reasoning LLMs with hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for discovering mathematical constructions.

Result: Proved that S(n) ≤ ⌈4n/5⌉, except when n is an odd multiple of 5, in which case S(n) ≤ 4n/5 + 1. This improves upon Paterson's 1971 bound of S(n) ≤ ⌈5n/6⌉. Also obtained new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in Q_n that can be sliced using k < n hyperplanes.

Conclusion: The paper presents the best known upper bound for the hypercube edge slicing problem, achieved through a combination of constructive mathematics and AI-assisted search techniques (CPro1). The results advance our understanding of this fundamental combinatorial geometry problem.

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuDiff Agent is an AI workflow system that automates crystallography data analysis from raw instrument data to validated crystal structures, reducing analysis time by 4.6-5.0x while maintaining quality and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale scientific facilities face analysis latency as a bottleneck, especially for complex samples requiring iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. Manual processes are time-consuming and limit scientific throughput.

Method: NeuDiff Agent is a governed, tool-using AI workflow that automates the crystallography pipeline (reduction, integration, refinement, validation) at TOPAZ facility. It uses allowlisted tools, fail-closed verification gates at workflow boundaries, and captures complete provenance for auditing and replay.

Result: In benchmark testing, NeuDiff Agent reduced wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5-94.4 minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing validated CIF files with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. Performance was tested with two LLM backends using fixed prompt protocols.

Conclusion: NeuDiff Agent provides a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and meeting publication validation requirements, significantly improving analysis efficiency and time-to-result.

Abstract: Large-scale facilities increasingly face analysis and reporting latency as the limiting step in scientific throughput, particularly for structurally and magnetically complex samples that require iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts.

### [178] [Node Learning: A Framework for Adaptive, Decentralised and Collaborative Network Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16814)
*Eiman Kanjo,Mustafa Aslanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Node Learning is a decentralized AI paradigm where intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and spreads through selective peer interactions, eliminating dependence on centralized infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces scalability issues in edge environments due to data transmission costs, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centers, which don't work well for heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained settings.

Method: Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchronization or central aggregation.

Result: The paper develops conceptual foundations for Node Learning, contrasting it with existing decentralized approaches and examining implications for communication, hardware, trust, and governance.

Conclusion: Node Learning provides a unified abstraction for autonomous and cooperative behavior that accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity, placing existing paradigms within a broader decentralized perspective.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

### [179] [An order-oriented approach to scoring hesitant fuzzy elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16827)
*Luis Merino,Gabriel Navarro,Carlos Salvatierra,Evangelina Santos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an order-oriented scoring framework for hesitant fuzzy sets, showing classical orders don't form lattices, introduces dominance functions for ranking with control sets, and demonstrates applications in group decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scoring approaches for hesitant fuzzy sets lack formal order-theoretic foundations, leading to less flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms.

Method: Develops a unified order-oriented scoring framework, analyzes classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, proves symmetric order satisfies normative criteria, introduces dominance functions with control sets, and provides concrete examples (discrete and relative dominance functions).

Result: Shows classical orders don't induce lattice structures, proves symmetric order satisfies strong monotonicity and Gärdenfors condition, demonstrates dominance functions can construct fuzzy preference relations and support group decision-making.

Conclusion: The order-oriented framework provides formal foundations for hesitant fuzzy scoring, dominance functions offer practical ranking tools with control sets, enabling more flexible decision-making applications.

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

### [180] [IndicJR: A Judge-Free Benchmark of Jailbreak Robustness in South Asian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16832)
*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Sanchari Chowdhuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IJR is a multilingual benchmark for adversarial safety testing across 12 Indic languages, revealing that contract-based evaluations inflate refusal rates but don't prevent jailbreaks, English attacks transfer strongly to Indic languages, and orthography (romanization) systematically affects safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignment is primarily evaluated in English and focuses on contract-bound scenarios, leaving multilingual vulnerabilities (especially for South Asian languages with 2.1B speakers) understudied, despite real-world usage involving code-switching and romanization.

Method: Created IJR benchmark with 45,216 prompts across 12 Indic/South Asian languages in two tracks: JSON (contract-bound) and Free (naturalistic). Used judge-free evaluation, human audits for detector reliability, and analyzed transfer attacks from English to Indic with format/instruction wrappers.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Contracts inflate refusals but don't stop jailbreaks (LLaMA/Sarvam >0.92 JSR in JSON, all models reach 1.0 in Free track); 2) English-to-Indic attacks transfer strongly with format wrappers often outperforming instruction wrappers; 3) Romanized/mixed inputs reduce JSR with correlations to romanization share and tokenization (~0.28-0.32).

Conclusion: IJR provides a reproducible multilingual stress test revealing risks hidden by English-only, contract-focused evaluations, especially critical for South Asian users who frequently code-switch and romanize, highlighting systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is mostly evaluated in English and contract-bound, leaving multilingual vulnerabilities understudied. We introduce \textbf{Indic Jailbreak Robustness (IJR)}, a judge-free benchmark for adversarial safety across 12 Indic and South Asian languages (2.1 Billion speakers), covering 45216 prompts in JSON (contract-bound) and Free (naturalistic) tracks.
  IJR reveals three patterns. (1) Contracts inflate refusals but do not stop jailbreaks: in JSON, LLaMA and Sarvam exceed 0.92 JSR, and in Free all models reach 1.0 with refusals collapsing. (2) English to Indic attacks transfer strongly, with format wrappers often outperforming instruction wrappers. (3) Orthography matters: romanized or mixed inputs reduce JSR under JSON, with correlations to romanization share and tokenization (approx 0.28 to 0.32) indicating systematic effects. Human audits confirm detector reliability, and lite-to-full comparisons preserve conclusions. IJR offers a reproducible multilingual stress test revealing risks hidden by English-only, contract-focused evaluations, especially for South Asian users who frequently code-switch and romanize.

TL;DR: OpenSage is the first agent development kit that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets, featuring comprehensive memory support and outperforming existing ADKs across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent development kits either lack sufficient functional support or require manual human design of agent components (topology, tools, memory), which limits agents' generalizability and overall performance.

Method: OpenSage enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets, provides comprehensive structured memory support with a hierarchical graph-based memory system, and includes specialized toolkits for software engineering tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate OpenSage's advantages over existing ADKs. Rigorous ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each design component.

Conclusion: OpenSage paves the way for next-generation agent development by shifting from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms, enabling automatic agent creation with self-generated components.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

*Tanqiu Jiang,Yuhui Wang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLAB is the first benchmark for evaluating LLM agent vulnerabilities to long-horizon attacks across 28 environments with 644 test cases, showing current agents remain highly susceptible despite existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in complex, long-horizon environments where they face novel security risks through multi-turn interactions that can't be addressed by single-turn attack defenses.

Method: Created AgentLAB benchmark with five novel attack types (intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, memory poisoning) across 28 realistic agentic environments with 644 security test cases.

Result: Evaluation shows representative LLM agents remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks, and existing defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate these threats.

Conclusion: AgentLAB serves as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings, highlighting the need for new defenses against long-horizon attacks.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in long-horizon, complex environments to solve challenging problems, but this expansion exposes them to long-horizon attacks that exploit multi-turn user-agent-environment interactions to achieve objectives infeasible in single-turn settings. To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings.

*Juliusz Ziomek,William Bankes,Lorenz Wolf,Shyam Sundhar Ramesh,Xiaohang Tang,Ilija Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Wikirace is a benchmark testing LLMs' ability to navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks from source to target pages, revealing that while top models achieve superhuman performance on easy tasks, they struggle significantly on hard ones, with planning and reasoning becoming critical bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that evaluates planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in LLMs through Wikipedia navigation tasks, identifying limitations in current reasoning systems and providing an open challenge for frontier models.

Method: Models must navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step-by-step from a source page to a target page, requiring look-ahead planning and understanding of conceptual connections. The benchmark includes easy and hard difficulty levels, evaluating both open- and closed-source models including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5.

Result: Top models achieve superhuman performance on easy tasks but performance drops sharply on hard ones: Gemini-3 succeeds in only 23% of hard games. World knowledge is necessary but insufficient beyond a threshold, where planning and long-horizon reasoning become dominant factors. Models struggle with replanning after failure and frequently enter loops.

Conclusion: LLM-Wikirace reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, showing that planning-capable LLMs still face substantial challenges in complex navigation tasks. The benchmark provides an open arena for evaluating and improving planning and reasoning capabilities in language models.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

### [185] [Narrow fine-tuning erodes safety alignment in vision-language agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16931)
*Idhant Gulati,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on harmful data causes severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly, with multimodal evaluation revealing worse safety degradation than text-only benchmarks suggest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifelong multimodal agents need continuous adaptation through post-training, but this creates tension between acquiring new capabilities and preserving safety alignment. The paper investigates how fine-tuning on harmful data affects alignment in vision-language models.

Method: Experiments on Gemma3-4B showing misalignment scales with LoRA rank, multimodal vs text-only evaluation, testing with 10% harmful data mixtures, geometric analysis of harmful behavior subspace, and evaluating mitigation strategies (benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering).

Result: Fine-tuning on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly (70.71±1.22 misalignment at r=128 in multimodal evaluation vs 41.19±2.51 in text-only). Even 10% harmful data causes substantial degradation. Harmful behaviors occupy low-dimensional subspace (10 principal components). Mitigation strategies reduce but don't completely remove harmful behaviors.

Conclusion: Current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings, highlighting the need for robust continual learning frameworks as unimodal safety benchmarks underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models.

Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

### [186] [DeepContext: Stateful Real-Time Detection of Multi-Turn Adversarial Intent Drift in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16935)
*Justin Albrethsen,Yash Datta,Kunal Kumar,Sharath Rajasekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepContext is a stateful RNN-based monitoring framework that tracks temporal intent evolution across multi-turn dialogues to detect jailbreak attacks that bypass stateless safety filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety guardrails are stateless and treat multi-turn dialogues as disconnected events, creating a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics (like Crescendo and ActorAttack) can slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass filters.

Method: DeepContext uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests sequences of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings and propagates a hidden state across conversations to capture incremental risk accumulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84 in multi-turn jailbreak detection, significantly outperforming hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and open-weight models like Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67), with sub-20ms inference overhead on T4 GPU.

Conclusion: Modeling sequential evolution of intent is more effective and computationally efficient than deploying massive stateless models for safety monitoring in multi-turn dialogues.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs focus primarily on answer correctness while neglecting the quality of cited web sources, despite the increasing use of web citations in LLM responses.

Method: Developed SourceBench with 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. Created an 8-metric framework covering content quality (relevance, accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (freshness, authority, clarity). Built a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments.

Result: Evaluated 8 LLMs, Google Search, and 3 AI search tools over 3996 cited sources. The benchmark provides four key new insights about GenAI and web search that can guide future research.

Conclusion: SourceBench addresses the gap in evaluating web source quality for LLM citations and reveals important insights about the relationship between GenAI and web search that should inform future research directions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.

### [188] [Mind the GAP: Text Safety Does Not Transfer to Tool-Call Safety in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16943)
*Arnold Cartagena,Ariane Teixeira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text safety doesn't guarantee tool-call safety in LLM agents - models can refuse harmful requests in text while executing forbidden actions through tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations focus on text-level refusal behavior, but don't assess whether alignment that suppresses harmful text also prevents harmful actions through tool calls in real-world agent deployments.

Method: Created GAP benchmark with systematic evaluation across 6 frontier models, 6 regulated domains, 7 jailbreak scenarios per domain, 3 system prompt conditions, and 2 prompt variants (17,420 datapoints). Formalized GAP metric to measure divergence between text safety and tool-call safety.

Result: Text safety doesn't transfer to tool-call safety. Models show instances of text refusal while simultaneously executing forbidden actions through tools. 219 such cases persisted even with safety-reinforced prompts. System prompt wording significantly influences tool-call behavior (21-57 percentage point variations). Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage but don't deter forbidden tool-call attempts.

Conclusion: Text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior. Tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation strategies separate from text safety approaches.

Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Cov: An offline agent-learning framework for hardware verification that enables scalable learning under execution constraints, achieving competitive performance with compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Execution-aware LLM agents need expensive and slow tool feedback, making online reinforcement learning impractical for hardware verification which relies on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals.

Method: Models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators, with execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling for scalable offline learning.

Result: A compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and showing competitive performance against models 10x larger.

Conclusion: LLM4Cov enables effective offline agent learning for hardware verification, overcoming execution constraints and achieving strong performance with compact models through innovative data curation and sampling techniques.

Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.

### [190] [Automating Agent Hijacking via Structural Template Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16958)
*Xinhao Deng,Jiaqing Wu,Miao Chen,Yue Xiao,Ke Xu,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phantom is an automated agent hijacking framework using structured template injection to exploit LLM agent architecture vulnerabilities, achieving high attack success rates and transferability across commercial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent hijacking attacks rely on manual prompt manipulation with low success rates and poor transferability to closed-source models. There's a need for automated attacks that target fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents rather than just semantic manipulation.

Method: Phantom uses Structured Template Injection targeting LLM agents' chat template token mechanisms. It employs multi-level template augmentation, trains a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed templates into continuous latent space, and uses Bayesian optimization to find optimal adversarial vectors that decode into high-potency structured templates.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency across Qwen, GPT, and Gemini models. Identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products confirmed by vendors.

Conclusion: Structured template-based hijacking poses severe practical threats to LLM agent ecosystems, requiring new security approaches. The framework provides empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems against architectural-level attacks.

Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.

### [191] [HQFS: Hybrid Quantum Classical Financial Security with VQC Forecasting, QUBO Annealing, and Audit-Ready Post-Quantum Signing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16976)
*Srikumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HQFS is a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline that integrates forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability for financial risk systems, improving prediction accuracy and portfolio performance while providing verifiable allocation records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-step financial risk systems (prediction then optimization) break under real constraints - predictions may look good but decisions become unstable with market shifts, discrete constraints, or slow optimization. Regulated settings also require clear audit trails linking decisions to model states.

Method: HQFS uses a three-step hybrid approach: 1) Learns next-step returns and volatility using variational quantum circuits with classical heads, 2) Converts risk-return objectives into QUBO problems solved via quantum annealing (with classical fallback), 3) Signs each rebalance output with post-quantum signatures for verifiability.

Result: HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% vs classical baseline. Improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4%, lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%, cuts QUBO solve time by 28% vs mixed-integer baseline, while producing fully traceable signed allocation records.

Conclusion: HQFS provides a practical solution that addresses the limitations of traditional financial risk systems by integrating quantum-enhanced prediction, efficient discrete optimization, and cryptographic auditability in a single pipeline suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

### [192] [Fundamental Limits of Black-Box Safety Evaluation: Information-Theoretic and Computational Barriers from Latent Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16984)
*Vishal Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Black-box safety evaluation fails for models with latent context-conditioned policies where rare triggers in evaluation become prevalent in deployment, with fundamental statistical and computational limits preventing reliable risk estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that black-box safety evaluation reliably predicts deployment performance for AI systems, particularly for models with unobserved internal variables that behave differently under evaluation vs deployment.

Method: Formal analysis using statistical minimax theory: (1) Passive evaluation with Le Cam's method, (2) Adaptive evaluation with hash-based triggers and Yao's minimax principle, (3) Computational separation using trapdoor one-way functions, and (4) White-box probing with bias correction.

Result: Proved fundamental limits: passive evaluation has error ≥0.208δL; adaptive evaluation error ≥δL/16; polynomial-time evaluators cannot detect trapdoor-activated unsafe behaviors; white-box probing requires O(1/(γ²ε_R²)) samples.

Conclusion: Black-box testing is statistically underdetermined for latent context-conditioned policies, necessitating additional safeguards like architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring for worst-case safety assurance.

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

*Yan Wang,Yi Han,Lingfei Qian,Yueru He,Xueqing Peng,Dongji Feng,Zhuohan Xie,Vincent Jim Zhang,Rosie Guo,Fengran Mo,Jimin Huang,Yankai Chen,Xue Liu,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Conv-FinRe is a conversational benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs on decision quality rather than just behavior imitation, using multi-view references to distinguish rational analysis from user noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation benchmarks focus on imitating user behavior, but in financial advisory, observed user actions can be noisy or short-sighted due to market volatility and may conflict with long-term goals. Treating user choices as sole ground truth conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality.

Method: Introduces Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark built from real market data and human decision trajectories. It includes onboarding interviews, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues where models must generate stock rankings over fixed investment horizons. Provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility based on investor-specific risk preferences.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models performing well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, while behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

Conclusion: Conv-FinRe enables diagnosis of whether LLMs follow rational analysis, mimic user noise, or are driven by market momentum. The benchmark addresses the limitations of behavior-only evaluation in financial advisory and is publicly available as a dataset and codebase.

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sonar-TS is a neuro-symbolic framework for natural language querying of time series databases, using a Search-Then-Verify pipeline with SQL and Python programs, evaluated on a new benchmark NLQTSBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL methods can't handle continuous morphological intents like shapes/anomalies, while time series models struggle with ultra-long histories. There's a need for better NLQ for time series databases (NLQ4TSDB) for non-expert users.

Method: Sonar-TS uses a neuro-symbolic Search-Then-Verify pipeline: 1) Feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, 2) Generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals, analogous to active sonar.

Result: Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. The paper introduces NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories, highlighting unique domain challenges.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research in natural language querying for time series databases.

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

### [195] [Cinder: A fast and fair matchmaking system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17015)
*Saurav Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cinder is a two-stage matchmaking system for multiplayer games that uses Ruzicka similarity for fast filtering and Kantorovich distance on skill buckets for precise fairness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional matchmaking based on average team skill metrics often creates unbalanced games, especially with heterogeneous skill levels in pre-made teams (lobbies). This negatively impacts player retention and satisfaction in multiplayer online games.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fast preliminary filter using Ruzicka similarity index on "non-outlier" skill ranges; 2) Precise fairness evaluation using Kantorovich distance on sorted skill bucket indices (derived from inverted normal distribution mapping), producing a "Sanction Score."

Result: System viability demonstrated through analysis of Sanction Score distribution from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

Conclusion: Cinder provides a robust solution for fair and fast matchmaking between lobbies with heterogeneous skill levels, addressing limitations of traditional average-based approaches.

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

*Zichen Wang,Wanli Ma,Zhenyu Ming,Gong Zhang,Kun Yuan,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2F is an agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean that converts textbook mathematics into verified Lean code at unprecedented scale and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated formalization is limited to isolated theorems and short snippets, unable to handle textbooks and research papers which require managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring entire projects compile end-to-end.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Statement compilation stage splits documents into atomic blocks, orders via dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons with placeholders; 2) Proof repair stage closes holes using goal-conditioned local edits. Both stages keep the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement.

Result: In ~3 weeks, converted 479 pages of real and convex analysis textbooks into 153,853 lines of Lean code. Achieved 96% proof success on FATE-H benchmark (vs 80% baseline). Demonstrates textbook-scale formalization at pace that typically requires months/years of expert effort.

Conclusion: Practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach, enabling mechanical verification of entire textbooks and research papers rather than just isolated theorems.

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PA-MoE addresses simplicity bias in RL by using phase-aware mixture of experts that groups temporally consistent patterns to the same expert, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods use single policy networks causing simplicity bias where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. Traditional MoE's token-level routing fragments phase-consistent patterns, undermining expert specialization.

Method: Proposes Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE) with a lightweight phase router that learns latent phase boundaries directly from RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. The phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PA-MoE approach.

Conclusion: PA-MoE successfully addresses the simplicity bias problem in RL by enabling phase-aware expert specialization through temporally consistent routing, improving performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.

TL;DR: ITR reduces LLM agent costs by 95% per-step tokens and improves tool routing by 32% via dynamic retrieval of only necessary instructions and tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents waste resources by re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each step, increasing costs, latency, tool errors, and derailment probability.

Method: Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR) - a RAG variant that retrieves minimal system-prompt fragments and smallest necessary tool subsets per step, composing dynamic runtime prompts with confidence-gated fallbacks.

Result: 95% reduction in per-step context tokens, 32% relative improvement in correct tool routing, 70% cut in end-to-end episode cost, enabling 2-20x more loops within context limits.

Conclusion: ITR is particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents as savings compound with steps, offering practical deployment guidance for cost-effective LLM agent operations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.

Conclusion: System-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments, with cooperative multi-agent loop providing largest gains on long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks.

*Yunseok Han,Yejoon Lee,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs often produce plausible-sounding but unfaithful rationales. The paper introduces a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness (stance consistency + causal influence) and RFEval benchmark, finding 49.7% unfaithfulness, especially in math/code tasks, with RL-style objectives reducing faithfulness even when accuracy is maintained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models produce rationales that sound plausible but don't reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. Current evaluation focuses on accuracy but doesn't assess whether the stated reasoning actually drives the answer.

Method: 1) Formal framework defining reasoning faithfulness via two conditions: stance consistency (coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (reasoning causally drives answer under output-level interventions). 2) RFEval benchmark with 7,186 instances across 7 tasks using controlled counterfactual interventions. 3) Evaluation of 12 open-source LRMs with within-family ablations.

Result: 49.7% of outputs show unfaithfulness, primarily from stance inconsistency. Failures concentrated in brittle domains like math and code. Post-training regimes (especially RL-style objectives) reduce faithfulness more than scale, even when accuracy is maintained. Accuracy is neither sufficient nor reliable proxy for faithfulness - the correlation is weak and statistically insignificant.

Conclusion: Trustworthy AI requires optimizing for both correct outcomes and structural integrity of reasoning. The work establishes rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability, showing current RL-style objectives can harm reasoning faithfulness. Need to move beyond accuracy-only evaluation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

Motivation: Existing value decomposition methods in cooperative MARL rely on single optimal actions and struggle to adapt when underlying value functions shift during training, often converging to suboptimal policies.

Method: Proposes Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q) which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions, and incorporates these into a Softmax-based behavior policy to encourage persistent exploration and enable quick adjustment to changing optima.

Result: Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

Conclusion: S2Q addresses the limitation of existing value decomposition methods by learning multiple sub-value functions, enabling better adaptation to shifting value functions and improved performance in cooperative MARL tasks.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

*Sumedh Rasal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PBS accelerates language model training by using a lightweight predictor to prioritize high-loss samples during batch construction, achieving 6-13% faster convergence with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current curriculum learning methods require predefined difficulty metrics or expensive per-sample loss tracking, which limits their practicality. There's a need for a more efficient approach that can dynamically identify difficult samples without significant computational cost.

Method: Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS) uses a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. The predictor is trained alongside the main model and dynamically prioritizes high-loss samples during batch construction.

Result: The predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features, improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer show 6-13% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints.

Conclusion: Token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead. PBS provides a practical and efficient alternative to traditional curriculum learning methods.

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: AI coding agents create distinct pull request descriptions that affect human reviewer engagement, response timing, and merge outcomes differently across agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid adoption of large language models and emergence of AI coding agents autonomously creating GitHub pull requests, there's limited understanding of how these agents differ in their PR description characteristics and how human reviewers respond to them.

Method: Empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset, examining agent differences in PR description characteristics (including structural features) and human reviewer responses (review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes).

Result: AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. Notable variation exists across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates.

Conclusion: Pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics play a significant role in human-AI collaborative software development, highlighting the importance of how AI agents communicate their changes.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models has led to the emergence of AI coding agents that autonomously create pull requests on GitHub. However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.

### [205] [Agentic Wireless Communication for 6G: Intent-Aware and Continuously Evolving Physical-Layer Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17096)
*Zhaoyang Li,Xingzhi Jin,Junyu Pan,Qianqian Yang,Zhiguo Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic AI for intent-driven autonomous intelligence in 6G physical layer communications, addressing multi-dimensional user objectives and dynamic environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G wireless systems face growing functional complexity and diverse service demands that cannot be captured by single metrics like throughput or reliability. User requirements now involve multi-dimensional objectives (latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, service-level requirements) that change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Accurate understanding of both communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainable 6G evolution.

Method: The paper investigates agentic AI for 6G physical layer through a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution. It reviews physical-layer tasks and their limitations, identifies application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discusses enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. The paper presents AgenCom as a case study - an intent-driven link decision agent that adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions, overcoming limitations of rule-driven or centrally optimized designs. LLMs provide strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning capabilities that make them promising foundations for intent-aware network agents in 6G systems.

Conclusion: Agentic AI based on LLMs offers a promising pathway for realizing intent-driven autonomous intelligence in 6G physical layer communications. This approach enables adaptive, context-aware network control that can handle multi-dimensional user objectives and dynamic environmental changes, supporting sustainable evolution of 6G wireless systems.

Abstract: As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.
  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.
  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.

### [206] [Toward Trustworthy Evaluation of Sustainability Rating Methodologies: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Benchmark Dataset Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17106)
*Xiaoran Cai,Wang Yang,Xiyu Ren,Chekun Law,Rohit Sharma,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal human-AI collaboration framework (STRIDE + SR-Delta) to create trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies, addressing the problem of inconsistent ESG ratings across agencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability/ESG ratings from different agencies for the same company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. This inconsistency undermines the effectiveness of sustainability assessments.

Method: Two-part framework: 1) STRIDE provides principled criteria and scoring system for constructing firm-level benchmark datasets using LLMs, and 2) SR-Delta is a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments.

Result: The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies, creating trustworthy benchmark datasets that can harmonize rating results across different agencies.

Conclusion: The paper calls for broader AI community adoption of AI-powered approaches to strengthen sustainability rating methodologies and support urgent sustainability agendas through more reliable and comparable ESG assessments.

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

### [207] [Owen-based Semantics and Hierarchy-Aware Explanation (O-Shap)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17107)
*Xiangyu Zhou,Chenhan Xiao,Yang Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: O-Shap introduces a new hierarchical segmentation approach for Owen value-based feature attribution that satisfies the T-property, improving semantic alignment and outperforming baseline SHAP variants in accuracy, coherence, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Shapley value methods assume feature independence, which breaks down in vision tasks where pixels have spatial and semantic dependencies. While Owen value (hierarchical Shapley) addresses this, its effectiveness depends on proper feature grouping, and current segmentation methods violate key consistency properties.

Method: Proposes a new segmentation approach that satisfies the T-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This enables computational pruning while maintaining attribution accuracy. The method is applied to Owen value-based feature attribution (O-Shap).

Result: Experiments on image and tabular datasets show O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

Conclusion: Proper hierarchical segmentation satisfying the T-property is crucial for effective Owen value-based attribution. O-Shap provides improved feature attribution by ensuring semantic alignment across hierarchy levels while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

### [208] [Instructor-Aligned Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17111)
*Abdulrahman AlRabah,Priyanka Kargupta,Jiawei Han,Abdussalam Alawini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InstructKG automatically constructs instructor-aligned knowledge graphs from lecture materials to capture learning dependencies and conceptual relationships for personalized education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding conceptual dependencies (prerequisites and sub-concepts) is crucial for identifying student knowledge gaps and enabling personalized interventions, especially in large-scale courses where manual diagnosis is infeasible. Existing approaches are either too surface-level or ignore pedagogical signals in instructional materials.

Method: InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships) from lecture materials (slides, notes). It synergizes temporal and semantic signals from educational materials (teaching order, definition mentions) with the generalizability of large language models.

Result: Through experiments on diverse real-world lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, InstructKG demonstrates the ability to capture rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

Conclusion: InstructKG provides an effective framework for automatically constructing knowledge graphs that capture intended learning progressions from educational materials, addressing the challenge of scalable personalized learning support.

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

### [209] [Epistemology of Generative AI: The Geometry of Knowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17116)
*Ilya Levin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that generative AI requires a new epistemological framework based on high-dimensional geometry, proposing "navigational knowledge" as a third mode of knowledge production distinct from symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI operates through opaque mechanisms that challenge traditional understandings of knowledge production. Without understanding its epistemic character, responsible integration into science, education, and institutions cannot proceed on a principled basis.

Method: Develops an "Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces" by analyzing four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry: concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity. Draws on Peirce's semiotics and Papert's constructionism to reconceptualize generative models as navigators of learned manifolds.

Result: Proposes "navigational knowledge" as a third mode of knowledge production that is distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination, emerging from the geometric properties of high-dimensional spaces in neural networks.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a paradigmatic break from the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, arguing that understanding generative AI requires recognizing how neural networks transform symbolic input into positions in geometric spaces of meaning, with navigation of these spaces constituting a new epistemic condition.

Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.

TL;DR: Novel parallel algorithm for decomposing hard CircuitSAT instances using specialized constraints to partition SAT instances into weakened formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve challenging CircuitSAT instances that arise in applications like Logical Equivalence Checking of Boolean circuits and preimage attacks on cryptographic hash functions, which are computationally hard problems.

Method: Parameterized parallel algorithm that uses specialized constraints to partition original SAT instances into a family of weakened formulas, with parallel hardness estimations to guide decomposition quality.

Abstract: We propose a novel parallel algorithm for decomposing hard CircuitSAT instances. The technique employs specialized constraints to partition an original SAT instance into a family of weakened formulas. Our approach is implemented as a parameterized parallel algorithm, where adjusting the parameters allows efficient identification of high-quality decompositions, guided by hardness estimations computed in parallel. We demonstrate the algorithm's practical efficacy on challenging CircuitSAT instances, including those encoding Logical Equivalence Checking of Boolean circuits and preimage attacks on cryptographic hash functions.

*Joseph Bingham,Sam Helmich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combine is a criterion-based pruning framework that provides standardized implementation for comparing pruning criteria, enabling efficient filter pruning in CNNs with up to 79% filter reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As CNNs grow larger and more computationally expensive, pruning solutions have emerged but lack standardized implementations and comparison frameworks, making them difficult to implement and evaluate consistently.

Method: Introduces Combine, a criterion-based pruning framework that provides a common implementation language for comparing pruning criteria, includes novel criterion functions, and supports iterative pruning of CNN filters.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on VGG-inspired models, achieving up to 79% filter pruning while retaining or improving accuracy, with up to 68% reduction in computational operations.

Conclusion: Combine provides an effective standardized framework for comparing pruning criteria, showing that different criteria have varying effects on different models, and enables significant CNN compression without accuracy loss.

Abstract: As the need for more accurate and powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) increases, so too does the size, execution time, memory footprint, and power consumption. To overcome this, solutions such as pruning have been proposed with their own metrics and methodologies, or criteria, for how weights should be removed. These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions. We show the capacity of these criterion functions and the framework on VGG inspired models, pruning up to 79\% of filters while retaining or improving accuracy, and reducing the computations needed by the network by up to 68\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEPA-DNA is a novel genomic foundation model framework that integrates Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with traditional generative objectives to capture both local genomic syntax and global functional context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) using Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) excel at capturing local genomic syntax but fail to capture broader functional context, resulting in representations lacking global biological perspective.

Method: JEPA-DNA integrates Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. It introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with predictive objectives in latent space, supervising a CLS token to predict high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides.

Result: Evaluations across diverse genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in both supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA provides more robust and biologically grounded representations, offering a scalable path toward foundation models that understand both the genomic alphabet and the underlying functional logic of sequences.

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard world modeling methods suffer from sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability in complex environments, requiring agents to internalize underlying world logic more effectively.

Method: Integrates continuous model learning and repair into agent's decision loop using Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to construct symbolic causal world models online, creating semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions through a hierarchy of disentangled concepts.

Result: The lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics where propositional methods fail due to combinatorial explosion, achieving orders of magnitude higher sample efficiency than PPO neural-network baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables agents to construct transparent, scalable symbolic causal world models online with superior sample efficiency compared to neural approaches, addressing key limitations of current world modeling methods.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.

TL;DR: Proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative workflow for humanities/social sciences research, validated using Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data, with focus on human-AI division of labor and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI research focuses mainly on software engineering and natural sciences, leaving humanities and social sciences under-explored methodologically. Need for structured AI collaboration frameworks in these fields.

Method: Seven-stage modular workflow based on three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability. Validated using Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N=7,729 conversations) from Anthropic Economic Index as empirical case study.

Result: Proposes replicable AI collaboration framework and identifies three human-AI collaboration modes: direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led. Demonstrates workflow feasibility through empirical analysis of Taiwan AI usage data.

Conclusion: Human judgment remains irreplaceable in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextual reasoning, and ethical reflection. Framework provides structured approach for humanities/social sciences AI collaboration while acknowledging limitations of single-platform data and AI reliability risks.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a "methodological experiment," this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.
  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.

*Ben Yellin,Ehud Ezra,Mark Foreman,Shula Grinapol*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LBM (Large Behavioral Model) is a fine-tuned behavioral foundation model that predicts individual strategic choices by conditioning on structured psychological trait profiles, outperforming prompting-based approaches and showing improved performance with richer trait data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with consistent, individual-specific behavior prediction in high-stakes environments, especially when predictions depend on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches are brittle, suffer from identity drift, and can't effectively leverage detailed persona descriptions.

Method: Introduces LBM which shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on structured, high-dimensional trait profiles derived from comprehensive psychometric batteries. Trained on proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices.

Result: LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Unlike prompting-based approaches that hit complexity ceilings, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles.

Conclusion: LBM establishes a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support by effectively mapping rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across strategic dilemmas.

Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.

TL;DR: LLMs encode cognitive complexity levels (Bloom's Taxonomy) in linearly separable neural representations, with ~95% classification accuracy showing early resolution of cognitive difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop evaluation frameworks that go beyond surface-level metrics by investigating how LLMs internally represent cognitive complexity, using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical structure to understand the black-box nature of these models.

Method: Analyzed high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, probing whether different cognitive levels (Remember to Create) are linearly separable within the model's residual streams using linear classifiers.

Result: Linear classifiers achieved approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom's Taxonomy levels, demonstrating that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations.

Conclusion: LLMs resolve cognitive difficulty early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers, providing evidence for structured internal encoding of cognitive complexity.

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

### [218] [All Leaks Count, Some Count More: Interpretable Temporal Contamination Detection in LLM Backtesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17234)
*Zeyu Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers introduce Shapley-DCLR to measure temporal knowledge leakage in LLMs during backtesting, and propose TimeSPEC method to filter leaked information while maintaining prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs may inadvertently use post-cutoff knowledge during retrospective evaluation, undermining the validity of backtesting for predicting future events. Current methods lack ways to detect and quantify this temporal knowledge leakage.

Method: 1) Framework decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability. 2) Uses Shapley values to measure each claim's contribution to predictions, creating Shapley-DCLR metric. 3) Proposes TimeSPEC method that interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to filter temporal contamination.

Result: Experiments on 350 instances across Supreme Court cases, NBA salaries, and stock returns show substantial leakage in standard prompting. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, outperforming prompt-based temporal constraints.

Conclusion: Explicit, interpretable claim-level verification (TimeSPEC) is more effective than prompt-based constraints for reliable backtesting, providing a framework to detect and mitigate temporal knowledge leakage in LLMs.

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

*Linxi Jiang,Rui Xi,Zhijie Liu,Shuo Chen,Zhiqiang Lin,Suman Nath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Web Verbs: A semantic layer for web actions that provides typed, documented functions as stable units for agents to discover and compose, improving reliability, efficiency, and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents operate on low-level primitives like clicks and keystrokes, which are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. As the web evolves into an agentic environment where software agents act on behalf of users, there's a need for a semantic layer for web actions to complement content-oriented semantic layers.

Method: Proposes Web Verbs - a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface. These verbs can be implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows, and include preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support. They serve as stable, composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs.

Result: Demonstrates through proof-of-concept implementation and case studies that Web Verbs enable concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. The approach unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, allowing LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow.

Conclusion: Web Verbs provide a semantic layer for web actions that improves reliability through stable interfaces, efficiency by reducing steps into function calls, and verifiability through typed contracts and checkable traces. The paper outlines a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale.

Abstract: The Web is evolving from a medium that humans browse to an environment where software agents act on behalf of users. Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces. We present our vision, a proof-of-concept implementation, and representative case studies that demonstrate concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. Finally, we outline a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While frontier LLMs show strong reasoning capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. The work aims to provide transparent engineering insights for researchers with moderate compute budgets.

Method: End-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training on 2xA100 GPUs.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

### [221] [MedClarify: An information-seeking AI agent for medical diagnosis with case-specific follow-up questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17308)
*Hui Min Wong,Philip Heesen,Pascal Janetzky,Martin Bendszus,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedClarify is an AI agent that generates follow-up questions for medical diagnosis, reducing diagnostic errors by ~27% compared to standard LLMs by using information-theoretic reasoning to resolve uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs struggle with incomplete patient cases and lack the ability to systematically reason through differential diagnoses via iterative questioning like human clinicians do in real-world practice.

Method: MedClarify computes candidate diagnoses (differential diagnosis), generates follow-up questions to reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and selects questions with highest expected information gain for targeted reasoning.

Result: The approach reduces diagnostic errors by approximately 27 percentage points compared to standard single-shot LLM baselines, demonstrating effective follow-up questioning capabilities.

Conclusion: MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking, enabling more effective dialogues that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.

*Angelo Porrello,Pietro Buzzega,Felix Dangel,Thomas Sommariva,Riccardo Salami,Lorenzo Bonicelli,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a dataless regularization method using curvature matrix approximation to prevent representation drift in task arithmetic, achieving SOTA results without external task data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task arithmetic enables modular adaptation of foundation models, but combining task vectors causes cross-task interference and representation drift. Existing regularization methods require external task data, which conflicts with modularity and privacy constraints.

Method: Frames regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. Uses Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) to create a practical regularizer that doesn't need external task data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Has constant complexity in number of tasks, promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, and eliminates need for held-out tuning.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective dataless regularization approach for task arithmetic that addresses representation drift without compromising modularity or requiring external data, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

*Adrià Molina,Oriol Ramos Terrades,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework integrating formal verification with deep learning for image retrieval, enabling trustworthy, verifiable results for complex natural language queries by explicitly verifying atomic truths in queries against retrieved content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embedding-based retrieval systems struggle with complex queries involving relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints (identities, counts, proportions). There's a need for more reliable, transparent, and accountable retrieval that goes beyond the ambiguity and approximation of vector representations.

Method: Integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Grounds retrieval results in formal reasoning to explicitly verify each atomic truth in user queries against retrieved content.

Result: Framework supports open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing trustworthy, verifiable results. Can identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, offering transparent and accountable retrieval while boosting performance of popular embedding-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework moves beyond uncertainty in vector representations by grounding retrieval in formal reasoning, enabling more reliable handling of complex queries and providing verifiable, transparent results that enhance existing embedding-based approaches.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCVAE: Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder for robust survival prediction in NSCLC with missing modalities, using modality-specific encoders, fusion bottleneck with gating, and multi-task learning with contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting NSCLC survival is challenging due to individual variability. Real-world clinical datasets often have missing modalities, and current models lack robustness in severe missingness scenarios. There's a need for robust multimodal integration that can handle incomplete data.

Method: Proposes MCVAE with: 1) modality-specific variational encoders to capture uncertainty, 2) fusion bottleneck with learned gating to normalize contributions from present modalities, 3) multi-task objective combining survival loss and reconstruction loss, 4) cross-modal contrastive loss for latent space alignment, and 5) stochastic modality masking during training for robustness.

Result: Extensive evaluations on TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets show efficacy in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and robustness to severe missingness compared to two state-of-the-art models. Found that multimodal integration is not always beneficial for the task.

Conclusion: MCVAE effectively addresses missing modality challenges in NSCLC survival prediction through robust multimodal integration with variational encoders, fusion bottleneck, and contrastive learning. The approach demonstrates superior performance and robustness, while revealing that not all modality combinations improve prediction.

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

*Diana Addae,Diana Rogachova,Nafiseh Kahani,Masoud Barati,Michael Christensen,Chen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Privacy-by-Design framework for developing AI applications for children that integrates privacy regulations (GDPR, PIPEDA, COPPA) and children's rights principles (UNCRC, AADC) throughout the LLM lifecycle, demonstrated through an educational tutor case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children are increasingly using AI technologies, raising significant privacy concerns. While privacy regulations require protections, implementing them in practice is challenging, especially for AI applications targeting children.

Method: Proposes a Privacy-by-Design framework that maps privacy principles from GDPR, PIPEDA, and COPPA to LLM application stages (data collection, model training, operational monitoring, validation). Includes design guidelines from UNCRC, AADC, and academic research, with a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13.

Result: The framework demonstrates how technical/organizational controls and age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM lifecycle can help developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal requirements for children's AI applications.

Conclusion: A proactive, risk-averse Privacy-by-Design approach integrating regulatory requirements and children's rights principles can support development of AI applications for children that provide adequate privacy protections and legal compliance.

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

TL;DR: KG-RAG framework combines knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain LLMs struggle in telecom due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology, leading to hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.

Method: KG-RAG integrates knowledge graphs (structured representation of telecom domain knowledge from standards/technical docs) with retrieval-augmented generation (dynamic retrieval of relevant facts) to ground LLM outputs.

Result: KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, achieving average accuracy improvements of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: KG-RAG effectively produces accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios by combining structured domain knowledge with dynamic retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

### [229] [Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544)
*Shashank Aggarwal,Ram Vikas Mishra,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new metrics (reusability and verifiability) to evaluate Chain-of-Thought reasoning quality in multi-agent systems, showing they don't correlate with standard accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multi-agent IR pipelines focuses only on target task accuracy, which fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself.

Method: Proposed a Thinker-Executor framework to decouple CoT generation from execution. Introduced two metrics: reusability (how easily Executor can reuse Thinker's CoT) and verifiability (how frequently Executor matches Thinker's answer using the CoT). Evaluated four Thinker models against ten Executor models across five benchmarks.

Result: Reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards. Surprisingly, CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable/verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the need for new evaluation metrics beyond accuracy to properly assess reasoning quality in multi-agent systems, revealing limitations in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

TL;DR: KLong is an open-source LLM agent trained for extremely long-horizon tasks using trajectory-splitting SFT and progressive RL training, achieving state-of-the-art performance on research paper and coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of training LLM agents to solve extremely long-horizon tasks, which require extended reasoning and planning capabilities beyond typical short-context problems.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Cold-start with trajectory-splitting SFT that preserves early context while progressively truncating later context with overlap, 2) Scale via progressive RL with multiple training stages using progressively extended timeouts. Uses Research-Factory pipeline to generate high-quality training data from research papers with evaluation rubrics.

Result: KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, with performance improvements generalizing to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-splitting SFT and progressive RL training enable effective training of LLM agents for extremely long-horizon tasks, with KLong demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities despite having fewer parameters than competing models.

Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

TL;DR: ODESteer: A unified ODE-based theoretical framework for activation steering in LLM alignment that uses barrier functions for multi-step adaptive steering, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods lack a unified theoretical framework and rely on one-step steering that fails to capture complex activation distribution patterns, limiting their effectiveness in LLM alignment.

Method: Proposes an ODE-based theoretical framework where activation addition is interpreted as first-order ODE approximation. Steering directions are identified by defining barrier functions as log-density ratios between positive/negative activations, enabling multi-step adaptive steering (ODESteer).

Result: ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements: 5.7% improvement over TruthfulQA, 2.5% over UltraFeedback, and 2.4% over RealToxicityPrompts compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled theoretical foundation for activation steering via ODEs and validates it empirically through ODESteer, advancing LLM alignment with a unified framework and improved performance.

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating AI general intelligence through performance on all conceivable human games, introduces AI GameStore platform for scalable game generation, and shows current VLMs perform poorly (under 10% of human average) on most games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks are too narrow and static, quickly saturating as developers optimize for them. There's a need for better evaluation of human-like general intelligence that captures the broad spectrum of human capabilities.

Method: Proposes evaluating AI through general game playing across all conceivable human games. Introduces AI GameStore platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games by sourcing and adapting game environments from popular platforms like Apple App Store and Steam.

Result: Generated 100 games based on top charts of Apple App Store and Steam. Evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short play episodes. Best models achieved less than 10% of human average score on majority of games, especially struggling with games requiring world-model learning, memory, and planning.

Conclusion: The AI GameStore provides a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence. Current AI systems are far from human-level performance on diverse human games, highlighting the need for continued development in world-model learning, memory, and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

### [237] [Structured Analytic Mappings for Point Set Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16753)
*Wei Feng,Tengda Wei,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Analytic-ICP: A non-rigid point set registration method using multivariate Taylor expansions to represent smooth deformations with closed-form analytic functions, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-rigid registration methods often rely on kernel functions or high-dimensional parameterizations, which can be computationally expensive and lack explicit analytic forms. The paper aims to develop a unified framework that can handle rigid, affine, and nonlinear deformations with low complexity and explicit representation.

Method: The method constructs a structured function space using truncated multivariate Taylor expansions to represent smooth deformations. A quasi-Newton optimization algorithm progressively lifts the identity map into higher-order analytic forms. This is embedded into an ICP loop using nearest-neighbor correspondences, resulting in Analytic-ICP with quasi-linear time complexity.

Result: Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that Analytic-ICP achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than classical methods like CPD and TPS-RPM, particularly for small and smooth deformations. The method demonstrates efficiency with quasi-linear time complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed analytic approximation model provides a unified framework for non-rigid registration that combines mathematical rigor with computational efficiency, offering advantages over existing methods in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and explicit representation of deformations.

Abstract: We present an analytic approximation model for non-rigid point set registration, grounded in the multivariate Taylor expansion of vector-valued functions. By exploiting the algebraic structure of Taylor expansions, we construct a structured function space spanned by truncated basis terms, allowing smooth deformations to be represented with low complexity and explicit form. To estimate mappings within this space, we develop a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm that progressively lifts the identity map into higher-order analytic forms. This structured framework unifies rigid, affine, and nonlinear deformations under a single closed-form formulation, without relying on kernel functions or high-dimensional parameterizations. The proposed model is embedded into a standard ICP loop -- using (by default) nearest-neighbor correspondences -- resulting in Analytic-ICP, an efficient registration algorithm with quasi-linear time complexity. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that Analytic-ICP achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than classical methods such as CPD and TPS-RPM, particularly for small and smooth deformations.

### [238] [Is there a relationship between Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND)?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17010)
*Jingwen Zhu,Hadi Amirpour,Wei Zhou,Patrick Le Callet*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper examines the relationship between JND (Just Noticeable Difference) and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) in video quality assessment, finding that while MOS values at JND points align with theory, reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video quality metrics cover broad quality ranges, but premium streaming scenarios require finer granularity for high-quality content. JND is crucial for perceptual bitrate ladder construction, but its relationship with the widely used MOS remains unclear, creating a gap in understanding how these two important quality assessment metrics relate to each other.

Method: Conducted a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) subjective study based on an existing JND dataset to examine how MOS corresponds to the 75% Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) points of the 1st and 2nd JNDs. Used statistical significance analysis to evaluate differences between reference and JND videos.

Result: MOS values at JND points generally align with theoretical expectations (e.g., 4.75 for 75% SUR of 1st JND), but reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals across PVS indices. DCR studies with limited participants may not detect meaningful differences between reference and JND videos.

Conclusion: The relationship between JND and MOS is complex - while forward mapping (JND to MOS) works reasonably well, reverse mapping (MOS to JND) is problematic due to statistical uncertainties. This has implications for using MOS-based metrics in high-quality streaming scenarios where JND modeling is critical for perceptual bitrate ladder optimization.

Abstract: Evaluating perceived video quality is essential for ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) in modern streaming applications. While existing subjective datasets and Video Quality Metrics (VQMs) cover a broad quality range, many practical use cases especially for premium users focus on high quality scenarios requiring finer granularity. Just Noticeable Difference (JND) has emerged as a key concept for modeling perceptual thresholds in these high end regions and plays an important role in perceptual bitrate ladder construction. However, the relationship between JND and the more widely used Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) subjective study based on an existing JND dataset to examine how MOS corresponds to the 75% Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) points of the 1st and 2nd JNDs. We find that while MOS values at JND points generally align with theoretical expectations (e.g., 4.75 for the 75% SUR of the 1st JND), the reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals across PVS indices. Statistical significance analysis further shows that DCR studies with limited participants may not detect meaningful differences between reference and JND videos.

*Liming Liu,Jiangkai Wu,Haoyang Wang,Peiheng Wang,Zongming Guo,Xinggong Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HybridPrompt combines traditional video codecs with generative neural models to achieve real-time 1080p decoding at 150+ FPS on smartphones, offering better quality than traditional codecs while being much faster than pure neural approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional codecs are fast but degrade in quality under low bandwidth, while neural codecs offer better quality but are too slow for real-time mobile playback. The paper aims to combine the speed of traditional codecs with the visual fidelity of neural approaches.

Method: Uses a hybrid architecture: generative model encodes keyframes, traditional codec handles remaining frames. Employs differentiable traditional decoding for end-to-end optimization, using subsequent frames as supervision to make keyframes optimal references. Includes two-stage generation strategy.

Result: Achieves real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on commercial smartphones. Outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving 8% average LPIPS gain over traditional codecs at 200kbps.

Conclusion: HybridPrompt successfully combines traditional and neural codec advantages, enabling high-quality real-time video playback on mobile devices by making generative keyframes mathematically optimal for traditional codec prediction.

Abstract: In Video on Demand (VoD) scenarios, traditional codecs are the industry standard due to their high decoding efficiency. However, they suffer from severe quality degradation under low bandwidth conditions. While emerging generative neural codecs offer significantly higher perceptual quality, their reliance on heavy frame-by-frame generation makes real-time playback on mobile devices impractical. We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone. Specifically, we employ a hybrid architecture that encodes Keyframes using a generative model while relying on traditional codecs for the remaining frames. A major challenge is that the two paradigms have conflicting objectives: the "hallucinated" details from generative models often misalign with the rigid prediction mechanisms of traditional codecs, causing bitrate inefficiency. To address this, we demonstrate that the traditional decoding process is differentiable, enabling an end-to-end optimization loop. This allows us to use subsequent frames as additional supervision, forcing the generative model to synthesize keyframes that are not only perceptually high-fidelity but also mathematically optimal references for the traditional codec. By integrating a two-stage generation strategy, our system outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving an average LPIPS gain of 8% over traditional codecs at 200kbps.

*Alexandra Spitzer,Lorenzo Baldassari,Valentin Derbanot,Ivan Dokmanić*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Poisson vs Gaussian objectives for imaging inverse problems: Poisson MAP performs well at low dose, but simple Gaussian surrogates can achieve comparable MSE despite departing from Poisson likelihood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a practical question about whether using Poisson objectives matters for MSE evaluation in imaging inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements, especially at low dose where Poisson noise dominates.

Method: Analyze MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise using a stylized diagonal model. Compare: 1) unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator, 2) Poisson MAP (with regularization), 3) heteroscedastic quadratic objective (normal approximation of Poisson data), and 4) homoscedastic quadratic objective (simple linear estimator).

Result: Unregularized Poisson MLE can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this through regularization. Both Gaussian surrogates (heteroscedastic and homoscedastic) can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in low-dose regime, despite departing from Poisson likelihood. Numerical CT experiments confirm these findings extend beyond theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: Simple Gaussian surrogate objectives can perform comparably to Poisson MAP for MSE in low-dose imaging problems, suggesting practical alternatives to computationally intensive Poisson objectives while maintaining similar reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In imaging inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements, it is common to use objectives derived from the Poisson likelihood. But performance is often evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), which raises a practical question: how much does a Poisson objective matter for MSE, even at low dose? We analyze the MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise. In a stylized diagonal model, we show that the unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this instability through regularization. We then study two Gaussian surrogate objectives: a heteroscedastic quadratic objective motivated by the normal approximation of Poisson data, and a homoscedastic quadratic objective that yields a simple linear estimator. We show that both surrogates can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in the low-dose regime, despite departing from the Poisson likelihood. Numerical computed tomography experiments indicate that these conclusions extend beyond the stylized setting of our theoretical analysis.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A control method for autonomous forklifts to unload pallets on inclined surfaces without dragging, using ICP algorithm for real-time tracking and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous forklifts struggle with unloading pallets on inclined surfaces, often causing pallets to drag during fork withdrawal, which can damage goods and equipment.

Method: Uses Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm on point clouds from the pallet's upper region to track relative position and attitude angle in real-time, then aligns fork parallel to target surface before withdrawal.

Result: Method successfully enables pallet unloading on inclined surfaces without dragging, verified through dynamic simulations and real forklift experiments on truck bed inclines.

Conclusion: The proposed ICP-based control method effectively solves the inclined surface unloading problem for autonomous forklifts, preventing pallet dragging through real-time tracking and alignment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control method for autonomous forklifts to unload pallets on inclined surfaces, enabling the fork to be withdrawn without dragging the pallets. The proposed method applies the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to point clouds measured from the upper region of the pallet and thereby tracks the relative position and attitude angle difference between the pallet and the fork during the unloading operation in real-time. According to the tracking result, the fork is aligned parallel to the target surface. After the fork is aligned, it is possible to complete the unloading process by withdrawing the fork along the tilt, preventing any dragging of the pallet. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through dynamic simulations and experiments using a real forklift that replicate unloading operations onto the inclined bed of a truck.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and accurate trajectory generation method for parallel kinematic milling robots that can handle decoupled position and orientation data while ensuring smooth motion, avoiding gimbal lock, and meeting spatial/temporal constraints for multi-agent systems.

Method: Integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation to manage position and orientation data separately. Uses smooth piece-wise Bezier curves to synchronize orientation with arc-length-parameterized position data via sequential quadratic programming. Employs unit quaternions for orientation interpolation and modifier polynomials for position interpolation. Optimizes temporal trajectories using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages (task space then joint space) on a low-cost microcontroller.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully generates smooth trajectories for 4-DOF parallel kinematic milling robots by effectively integrating position and orientation interpolation while meeting spatial/temporal constraints, demonstrating practical implementation on low-cost hardware with superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a smooth trajectory generation method for a four-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic milling robot. The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.

Motivation: Traditional STL-based motion planners use min-max robustness measures that create non-smooth optimization landscapes with sharp decision boundaries, hindering efficient tree exploration in sampling-based planning.

Method: Proposes RRT$^η$ framework with three key contributions: (1) AGM robustness interval semantics for partial trajectory reasoning, (2) efficient incremental monitoring algorithm for AGM intervals, and (3) enhanced Direction of Increasing Satisfaction vectors using Fulfillment Priority Logic for objective composition.

Conclusion: RRT$^η$ effectively addresses the limitations of traditional min-max robustness measures by using AGM robustness, enabling more efficient exploration in complex multi-constraint scenarios with limited guidance signals.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning has emerged as a powerful approach for robotics, enabling exploration of complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces. When combined with Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a temporal logic widely used for formalizing interpretable robotic tasks, these methods can address complex spatiotemporal constraints. However, traditional approaches rely on min-max robustness measures that focus only on critical time points and subformulae, creating non-smooth optimization landscapes with sharp decision boundaries that hinder efficient tree exploration.
  We propose RRT$^η$, a sampling-based planning framework that integrates the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) robustness measure to evaluate satisfaction across all time points and subformulae. Our key contributions include: (1) AGM robustness interval semantics for reasoning about partial trajectories during tree construction, (2) an efficient incremental monitoring algorithm computing these intervals, and (3) enhanced Direction of Increasing Satisfaction vectors leveraging Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL) for principled objective composition. Our framework synthesizes dynamically feasible control sequences satisfying STL specifications with high robustness while maintaining the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of RRT$^\ast$. We validate our approach on three robotic systems. A double integrator point robot, a unicycle mobile robot, and a 7-DOF robot arm, demonstrating superior performance over traditional STL robustness-based planners in multi-constraint scenarios with limited guidance signals.

Abstract: Distributed tactile sensing remains difficult to scale over large areas: dense sensor arrays increase wiring, cost, and fragility, while many alternatives provide limited coverage or miss fast interaction dynamics. We present Sound of Touch, an active acoustic tactile-sensing methodology that uses vibrating tensioned strings as sensing elements. The string is continuously excited electromagnetically, and a small number of pickups (contact microphones) observe spectral changes induced by contact. From short-duration audio signals, our system estimates contact location and normal force, and detects slip. To guide design and interpret the sensing mechanism, we derive a physics-based string-vibration simulator that predicts how contact position and force shift vibration modes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous robots increasingly operate in public spaces (campuses, sidewalks), traditional HRI field studies are limited to controlled experiments or Wizard of Oz techniques, which don't capture the reality of autonomous robots operating beyond researcher control in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology inspired by public realm ethnography from urban studies, geography, and sociology. The method involves accompanying robots in their natural environments to observe their interactions and navigation in real-world settings.

Result: The paper outlines key features of WawR, steps for implementation, unique insights it offers, and evaluation methods for this approach to studying autonomous robots in public spaces.

Conclusion: WawR methodology addresses the challenge of studying autonomous robots operating beyond researcher control and aims to stimulate further discussion on research methodologies for studying robots in public spaces.

Abstract: As the presence of autonomous robots in public spaces increases-whether navigating campus walkways or neighborhood sidewalks-understanding how to carefully study these robots becomes critical. While HRI research has conducted field studies in public spaces, these are often limited to controlled experiments with prototype robots or structured observational methods, such as the Wizard of Oz technique. However, the autonomous mobile robots we encounter today, particularly delivery robots, operate beyond the control of researchers, navigating dynamic routes and unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a more deliberate approach is required. Drawing inspiration from public realm ethnography in urban studies, geography, and sociology, this paper proposes the Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology. We outline the key features of this method, the steps we applied in our study, the unique insights it offers, and the ways it can be evaluated. We hope this paper stimulates further discussion on research methodologies for studying autonomous robots in public spaces.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimToolReal: A sim-to-real RL approach for general dexterous tool manipulation that trains on procedurally generated tool-like objects and achieves zero-shot performance on diverse real-world tools without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool manipulation is challenging for robots due to difficulties in grasping thin objects, in-hand rotations, and forceful interactions. Collecting teleoperation data is hard, and existing sim-to-real RL methods require extensive engineering for each specific object/task.

Method: Procedurally generate diverse tool-like object primitives in simulation, then train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This enables generalization without object/task-specific training.

Result: Outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37%, matches specialist RL policies trained on specific objects/tasks, and achieves strong zero-shot performance across 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.

Conclusion: SimToolReal demonstrates that training on procedurally generated tool-like objects enables general dexterous tool manipulation, achieving strong zero-shot performance on diverse real-world tools without task-specific engineering.

Abstract: The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.

TL;DR: MALLVi is a multi-agent LLM/VLM framework for closed-loop robotic manipulation that coordinates specialized agents for perception, localization, reasoning, and planning with environmental feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior LLM-based task planning approaches are fragile in dynamic settings because they operate open-loop without robust environmental feedback, relying on specialized models, fine-tuning, or prompt tuning.

Method: MALLVi coordinates specialized agents (Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, Reflector, optional Descriptor) to generate executable atomic actions from natural language instructions and environmental images. After execution, a VLM evaluates feedback to decide next steps. The Reflector enables targeted error recovery by reactivating only relevant agents.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that iterative closed-loop multi-agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero-shot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MALLVi demonstrates that closed-loop feedback-driven multi-agent coordination enhances robustness and generalization in robotic manipulation compared to open-loop approaches.

Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.

TL;DR: A graph-based approach for learning long-horizon manipulation tasks from demonstrations by capturing complete object interactions across task phases, with object matching using pre-trained visual features for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks efficiently is challenging. Instead of learning actions directly, the paper focuses on inferring what the robot should achieve (task goals) rather than how to achieve them, addressing limitations of prior methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows.

Method: Proposes demonstration segmentation and pooling to extract manipulation graphs representing evolving scene states through graphical object relationships. Captures complete object interactions from control onset to manipulation end. Uses pre-trained visual features for object matching to improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations.

Result: Evaluated demonstration segmentation accuracy and utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding minimal task models. Deployed fitted models in simulation and on real robots, showing that resulting task representations support reliable execution across environments.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach successfully learns task representations that capture complete object interactions across task phases, enabling reliable execution in both simulation and real-world environments, addressing the challenge of learning long-horizon manipulation tasks from demonstrations.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks efficiently is a central challenge in robot learning from demonstration. Unlike recent endeavors that focus on directly learning the task in the action domain, we focus on inferring what the robot should achieve in the task, rather than how to do so. To this end, we represent evolving scene states using a series of graphical object relationships. We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features. In extensive experiments, we evaluate our method's demonstration segmentation accuracy and the utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding a desired minimal task model. Finally, we deploy the fitted models both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that the resulting task representations support reliable execution across environments.

*Varun Burde,Pavel Burget,Torsten Sattler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A physics-based benchmark evaluates 3D reconstruction quality and 6D pose estimation by measuring their functional impact on robotic grasping performance, revealing that reconstruction artifacts reduce grasp candidates but don't significantly affect success given accurate pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods produce visually impressive meshes, but standard geometric evaluations don't reflect how reconstruction quality affects downstream robotic manipulation tasks like grasping.

Method: Introduces a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on grasping efficacy. Generates grasps on reconstructed meshes and executes them on ground-truth models in simulation to assess combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies.

Result: Reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have negligible effect on grasping performance given accurate pose estimation. Spatial error dominates the relationship between grasp success and pose error, and even simple translation error provides insight into grasping success for symmetric objects.

Conclusion: This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots, establishing a functional benchmark that connects 3D reconstruction quality to actual robotic grasping performance.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots.

*Tanisha Parulekar,Ge Shi,Josh Pinskier,David Howard,Jen Jen Chung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CFM-based framework maps rigid gripper grasp poses to soft Fin-ray gripper poses, achieving significantly higher success rates than rigid pose baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp synthesis methods (like Anygrasp) are designed for rigid parallel grippers and fail to capture the unique compliant behaviors of soft grippers, leading to data-intensive and inaccurate models for soft robotic grasping.

Method: Uses Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) generative model to learn transformation from rigid to soft gripper poses. Includes data collection pipeline for paired rigid-soft grasp poses, and U-Net autoencoder to condition CFM on object geometry from depth images.

Result: CFM-generated poses achieve 34% success rate for seen objects and 46% for unseen objects with soft gripper, compared to baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively). Particularly effective for cylindrical (50-100% success) and spherical objects (25-31% success).

Conclusion: CFM is a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies from rigid to soft grippers, offering scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems.

Abstract: A representation gap exists between grasp synthesis for rigid and soft grippers. Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems.

Motivation: Hybrid rigid-soft robots offer precision and compliance but face coordination challenges in modeling, perception, and cross-domain kinematics

Method: AR headset-based physical human-robot interaction framework with simulated model overlay on real system, plus real-to-simulation parameter identification pipeline using soft robot's geometric properties

Result: Enables direct teleoperation of hybrid rigid-soft robots for reaching and grasping tasks with consistent behavior between virtual and physical systems

Conclusion: AR-based framework with accurate modeling addresses coordination challenges in hybrid rigid-soft robot teleoperation for unstructured environments

Abstract: Hybrid rigid-soft robots combine the precision of rigid manipulators with the compliance and adaptability of soft arms, offering a promising approach for versatile grasping in unstructured environments. However, coordinating hybrid robots remains challenging, due to difficulties in modeling, perception, and cross-domain kinematics. In this work, we present a novel augmented reality (AR)-based physical human-robot interaction framework that enables direct teleoperation of a hybrid rigid-soft robot for simple reaching and grasping tasks. Using an AR headset, users can interact with a simulated model of the robotic system integrated into a general-purpose physics engine, which is superimposed on the real system, allowing simulated execution prior to real-world deployment. To ensure consistent behavior between the virtual and physical robots, we introduce a real-to-simulation parameter identification pipeline that leverages the inherent geometric properties of the soft robot, enabling accurate modeling of its static and dynamic behavior as well as the control system's response.

### [253] [Contact-Anchored Proprioceptive Odometry for Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17393)
*Minxing Sun,Yao Mao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Purely proprioceptive state estimator for legged robots using only IMU and motor measurements, treating contacting legs as kinematic anchors to suppress drift through footfall constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR is challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. Existing methods often rely on external sensors, but a purely proprioceptive solution is needed for robustness in various environments.

Method: Uses IMU and motor measurements to estimate body pose and velocity. Key innovations: 1) Treat contacting legs as kinematic anchors using joint-torque-based foot wrench estimation to select reliable contacts, 2) Height clustering and time-decay correction to prevent elevation drift, 3) Inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter to improve foot velocity observations, 4) Multi-contact geometric consistency to mitigate yaw drift.

Result: Evaluated on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and Unitree Go2 EDU). Achieved low drift errors: Astrall robot A had 0.1638m horizontal and 0.219m vertical errors over ~200m and ~15m loops; wheel-legged robot B had 0.2264m horizontal and 0.199m vertical errors; wheel-legged robot C had 7.68m horizontal error over ~700m and 0.540m vertical error over ~20m; Unitree Go2 EDU had 2.2138m horizontal error over ~120m and <0.1m vertical error over ~8m.

Conclusion: The proposed purely proprioceptive state estimator effectively suppresses long-term drift for legged robots without external sensors, demonstrating robust performance across different robot types (biped, quadruped, wheel-legged) and achieving accurate odometry in both horizontal and vertical navigation tasks.

Abstract: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous framework for trajectory design and feasibility checks without relying on local attitude coordinates.

Method: Coordinate-free formulation on SO(3) with translational force balance in world frame and rotational dynamics in body frame; aerodynamic directions defined geometrically; enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip) to derive closed-form trajectory-to-input map.

Result: Derived closed-form map yielding attitude, angular velocity, thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and aerodynamic moment coefficients; obtained analytic expressions for required bank angle in tethered flight; identified zero-bank locus where tether tension balances centrifugal effects; found closed-form minimal-thrust angle of attack under simple lift/drag law.

Conclusion: The framework provides rigorous building blocks for trajectory design and feasibility checks, demonstrating decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and apparent gravity vector, with pointwise solutions becoming steady-flight trim under time-invariant conditions.

Abstract: We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks.

Result: ROM shows stability, efficiency, and robustness; controller effectively regulates cable dynamics under various conditions; framework enables real-time control and trajectory planning in constrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables real-time aerial manipulation of extensible cables by combining accurate modeling with computationally efficient control for practical UAV applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for aerial manipulation of an extensible cable that combines a high-fidelity model based on partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reduced-order representation suitable for real-time control. The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables.

Abstract: Operating in previously visited environments is becoming increasingly crucial for autonomous systems, with direct applications in autonomous driving, surveying, and warehouse or household robotics. This repeated exposure to observing the same areas poses significant challenges for mapping and localization -- key components for enabling any higher-level task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models for world modeling in robotics have two main problems: 1) training objectives over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, limiting semantic learning and generalization, and 2) reliance on predicted future observations during inference leads to error accumulation.

Method: FRAPPE uses a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: 1) Mid-training phase where the model learns to predict latent representations of future observations, and 2) Post-training phase with parallel computational expansion and simultaneous representation alignment with multiple visual foundation models.

Result: Experiments on RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks show FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrates strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies by improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data.

Abstract: Enabling VLA models to predict environmental dynamics, known as world modeling, has been recognized as essential for improving robotic reasoning and generalization. However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.

Demonstrated safe collaboration with up to 2 robots and 2 humans (4 robots in simulation) while maintaining ~20 cm inter-agent separation. Achieved deadlock-free operation across all tested team sizes.

Conclusion: The framework provides intuitive robot behavior shaping through parameter adjustment, enables safe decentralized human-robot collaboration, and scales effectively without structural changes due to its distributed implementation.

Abstract: We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.

*Diana Cafiso,Petr Trunin,Carolina Gay,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SOLen: 3D printed soft optical sensing using a printed lens in a Y-shaped waveguide that converts deformation into differential optical signals for motion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for sensing solutions compatible with single-material, one-step additive manufacturing of soft robots. Current optical soft sensors suffer from uncontrolled light propagation issues, and mitigation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces.

Method: Developed SOLen approach: a printed lens placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. Deformation causes lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between two branches. Used modified acrylate polyurethane resin with lauryl acrylate for better compliance and optical properties. Single-layer optical characterization to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance, then used simulations to design lens profile for target focal distance.

Result: Successfully printed lens with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles. Established a transferable material-to-optics workflow for soft optical sensors.

Conclusion: SOLen enables lens-based optical sensing for soft robots with new functionalities, compatible with single-material, one-step 3D printing, addressing the challenge of uncontrolled light propagation in optical soft sensors.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing is enabling soft robots with increasingly complex geometries, creating a demand for sensing solutions that remain compatible with single-material, one-step fabrication. Optical soft sensors are attractive for monolithic printing, but their performance is often degraded by uncontrolled light propagation (ambient coupling, leakage, scattering), while common miti- gation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces. Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles. These results establish a transferable material-to-optics workflow for soft optical sensors with lens with new functionalities for next-generation soft robots

Abstract: Recent advances in automated vehicles have focused on improving perception performance under adverse weather conditions; however, research on physical hardware solutions remains limited, despite their importance for perception critical applications such as vehicle platooning. Existing approaches, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic lenses and sprays, provide only partial mitigation, while industrial protection systems imply high cost and they do not enable scalability for automotive deployment.

*Carolina Gay,Petr Trunin,Diana Cafiso,Yuejun Xu,Majid Taghavi,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OS-ERA introduces optical waveguide sensors into Electro-Ribbon Actuators to enable reliable proprioceptive sensing and accurate bending state classification, overcoming limitations of traditional capacitive sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electro-Ribbon Actuators (ERAs) have excellent displacement and speed capabilities but suffer from limited sensing precision using capacitive sensors, which hinders accurate control and closed-loop operation.

Method: Design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors into ERA to analyze complex curvature. Train a classifier to map sensing signals to distinguish eight bending states, validating on held-out trials and comparing against training signal trajectories.

Result: OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity, showing repeatability and practical voltage- and speed-invariance. Sensing signals follow training manifold, predicted sequences mirror real performance, and classification remains accurate despite actuation speed mismatches.

Conclusion: OS-ERA solves the longstanding sensing bottleneck of ERAs, enabling steps toward closed-loop control through reliable proprioceptive information without affecting actuation performance.

Abstract: Electro-Ribbon Actuators (ERAs) are lightweight flexural actuators that exhibit ultrahigh displacement and fast movement. However, their embedded sensing relies on capacitive sensors with limited precision, which hinders accurate control. We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Above-knee placement of powered prosthetic knee powertrain shows functional feasibility with improved walking speed and cadence compared to below-knee placement, suggesting mass distribution optimization can preserve benefits while mitigating added weight effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Powered prosthetic knees help restore mobility for lower limb amputees but add mass that can diminish benefits. Optimizing mass distribution rather than just minimizing total mass may be more effective.

Method: Exploratory study evaluating above-knee vs below-knee powertrain placement for powered prosthetic knee in small cohort. Tested walking, ramps, and stairs with kinematic measures and gait symmetry analysis.

Result: Above-knee configuration showed improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed gait symmetry effects. Similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Control strategy robust across multiple locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Above-knee placement is functionally feasible and careful mass distribution can preserve powered assistance benefits while mitigating adverse weight effects. Further studies needed to confirm trends and guide design/clinical recommendations.

Abstract: Lower limb amputation affects millions worldwide, leading to impaired mobility, reduced walking speed, and limited participation in daily and social activities. Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations.

*Ziyi Zong,Xin Dong,Jinwu Xiang,Daochun Li,Zhan Tu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RA-Nav is a risk-aware aerial robot navigation framework that uses semantic segmentation to classify obstacles and predict risks, enabling safe navigation when static obstacles suddenly move.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial navigation systems fail to adapt when static obstacles suddenly start moving, lacking environmental semantic awareness to estimate potential risks from such state transitions.

Method: Uses lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation to identify obstacle categories in real-time, classifies them into stationary/temporarily static/dynamic types, designs risk estimation functions for each type, constructs local risk maps, and applies risk-informed path search with trajectory optimization.

Result: RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios, with effectiveness validated in simulations using real-world data.

Conclusion: The semantic-aware risk estimation framework enables aerial robots to navigate safely when obstacles unexpectedly change from static to dynamic, balancing path efficiency and safety.

Abstract: Existing aerial robot navigation systems typically plan paths around static and dynamic obstacles, but fail to adapt when a static obstacle suddenly moves. Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to computationally intensive mixed-integer programming that's sensitive to numerical formulation.

Method: Pairs hybrid zonotopes (advanced set representation) with new ADMM mixed-integer programming heuristic for motion planning of hybrid systems. Presents general treatment of PWA system reachability using hybrid zonotopes and extends to optimal planning problems.

Result: Sets have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than preexisting techniques. ADMM heuristic efficiently uses hybrid zonotope structure and achieves improved convergence rates compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics.

Conclusion: Proposed methods enable efficient hybrid system planning on embedded hardware, experimentally validated in combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.

*Antonio Guillen-Perez*

TL;DR: Deep-Flow: Unsupervised safety-critical anomaly detection for autonomous vehicles using Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching on low-rank spectral manifolds to identify rare, high-risk driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based heuristics cannot scale to detect rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios for Level 4 autonomous vehicle safety validation, creating a bottleneck in safety deployment.

Method: Uses OT-CFM to model expert human driving probability density, constrained to low-rank PCA spectral manifold for kinematic smoothness. Incorporates Early Fusion Transformer with lane-aware goal conditioning and skip-connections for intent integrity. Includes kinematic complexity weighting prioritizing high-energy maneuvers during simulation-free training.

Result: Achieves AUC-ROC of 0.766 on Waymo Open Motion Dataset against heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. Identifies fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance, revealing predictability gap for out-of-distribution behaviors like lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers.

Conclusion: Provides mathematically rigorous foundation for statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for safe deployment of autonomous fleets by detecting overlooked safety-critical anomalies.

Abstract: Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance.

*Rahul Thomas,Arka Pal*

TL;DR: Block verification (BV) is optimal for speculative decoding, and greedy multi-path block verification (GBV) improves efficiency by 30%+ over BV and 15%+ over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate autoregressive decoding of large language models using speculative decoding with draft models, and to improve upon existing verification algorithms by considering multi-path approaches.

Method: Developed an information-agnostic linear program (LP) to prove BV's optimality, extended LP to multi-path settings, and created greedy multi-path block verification (GBV) as an efficient approximation.

Result: GBV improves block efficiency by over 30% and reduces decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV improves throughput by more than 15% over SOTA multi-path methods.

Conclusion: Block verification is optimal for speculative decoding, and greedy multi-path extensions (GBV) provide significant practical improvements in decoding efficiency and throughput.

Abstract: The goal of $L$-step speculative decoding is to accelerate autoregressive decoding of a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a candidate path of $L$ tokens. Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.

Formulate latency minimization problem with joint optimization of BS computation resources, STAR-RIS coefficient matrix, AR users' CPU frequencies, and transmit power. Use approximate transformation, alternating optimization, penalty function method for RIS coefficients, closed-form solution for CPU frequencies, and Lagrange duality for power and resource allocation.

Conclusion: The STAR-RIS-assisted framework successfully addresses resource management challenges in AR-enabled Metaverse systems, achieving significant latency improvements through joint optimization of multiple system parameters.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR)-enabled Metaverse is a promising technique to provide immersive service experience for mobile users. However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning for effective task execution, but differing latent representations in AI-native devices can cause semantic mismatches that hinder mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigating latent space misalignment in multi-agent AI- native semantic communications. In a downlink scenario, we consider an access point (AP) communicating with multiple users to accomplish a specific AI-driven task. Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides. Numerical results validate the proposed approach in goal-oriented semantic communication, revealing key trade-offs among accuracy, com- munication overhead, complexity, and the semantic proximity of AI-native communication devices.
