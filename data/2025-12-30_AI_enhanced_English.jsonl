Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS.

We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates.

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does.

In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery.

To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports.

Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module.

Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy.

While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass.

Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism.

Then, the RP of signals passing through RIS pixels is jointly examined under combined phase and amplitude uncertainties. In addition, we propose four pixel reflection models to capture practical conditions, and we derive approximate polynomial upper bounds for the RP with error terms by applying Taylor expansion. Furthermore, based on Friis transmission formula and projected aperture, we propose a general NF channel model that incorporates the coupling between the PSEs and the PDAs. By using Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality and Riemann sums, we derive a closed-form upper bound on spectral efficiency, and the bound becomes tighter as the pixel area decreases. We reveal that as the RIS phase shifts approach the ends of their range, the RP under independent and identically distributed PEs is smaller than that under fully correlated PEs, whereas this relationship reverses when the phase shifts are near the middle of their range.

We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA.

However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests.

Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation.

Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, \"PatchNorm\", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation.

The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering.

Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gamma introduces multi-head geometric attention for knowledge graph reasoning, replacing single relational transformations with multiple parallel ones (real, complex, split-complex, dual) and adaptively fusing them, achieving better zero-shot inductive performance than Ultra.", "motivation": "Existing structural knowledge graph foundation models like Ultra rely on single relational transformations in message passing, which constrains expressiveness and fails to capture diverse relational and structural patterns on diverse graphs.", "method": "Gamma introduces multi-head geometric attention with multiple parallel relational transformations (real, complex, split-complex, dual number based), and a relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism that adaptively fuses them at link level via lightweight gating with entropy regularization.", "result": "Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on inductive benchmarks and 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks on 56 diverse knowledge graphs.", "conclusion": "Gamma's multi-head geometric attention with complementary geometric representations enhances expressiveness beyond single-space models, enabling better generalization to unseen graphs with diverse relational structures."}}

Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates.

In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training.

However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space.

We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing.

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct.

Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner.

To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents.

First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary.

From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions.
