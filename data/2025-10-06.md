### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF is a novel framework that replaces expensive trained reward models with a general Oracle ranker and uses rank-based optimization to make video-language model fine-tuning more cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF) frameworks require expensive specialized reward models trained with video narratives, making fine-tuning costly and restrictive as video-language models scale up.

Method: Proposes Oracle-RLAIF framework using a general Oracle ranker instead of trained reward models, and introduces $GRPO_{rank}$ - a rank-based loss function that optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages.

Result: Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading video-language models using existing fine-tuning methods across various video comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF enables flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models using reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR is a unified framework that directly learns visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in physics simulator, enabling physically grounded motion reconstruction from monocular videos without two-stage processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use kinematics-based pose estimation followed by physics post-processing, which causes error accumulation and limits reconstruction quality. There's a need for physically plausible motion reconstruction that avoids these artifacts.

Method: Uses pixel-as-ray strategy to lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays, combines with local visual features from pretrained encoder, and employs distillation scheme to transfer motion knowledge from mocap-trained expert to vision-conditioned policy with reinforcement learning rewards.

Result: Produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: PhysHMR successfully addresses the limitations of two-stage approaches by providing a unified framework that directly learns physically grounded motion reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)
*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-machine collaboration in face identification improves accuracy when collaborators have similar baseline performance levels, following the Proximal Accuracy Rule. Intelligent fusion that selectively combines human and machine judgments outperforms both individual machine performance and indiscriminate combination approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish when and how human-machine collaboration improves face identification accuracy, given individual differences between people and machines that can either enhance or degrade system performance.

Method: Analyzed human-human and human-machine collaborations using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers. Developed the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR) to predict collaborative benefits and established a critical fusion zone. Implemented intelligent human-machine fusion by selecting humans with potential to improve machine accuracy.

Result: Collaborative benefits increased as baseline accuracy differences between collaborators decreased. The critical fusion zone where humans improve machine accuracy was surprisingly large. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than machine alone and better than combining all judgments. Human-only partnerships achieved good performance but intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized low-performing human impact.

Conclusion: Both humans and machines play meaningful roles in accurate face identification. The study provides an evidence-based roadmap for intelligent AI use in face identification systems through selective human-machine collaboration.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models, addressing hallucination issues through a novel metric and method (S-QUBED) that decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models hallucinate like LLMs but lack uncertainty quantification methods, raising safety concerns for real-world applications.

Method: Proposed framework with: (i) calibration metric based on robust rank correlation, (ii) S-QUBED black-box UQ method using latent modeling to decompose uncertainty, (iii) UQ dataset for benchmarking.

Result: S-QUBED produces calibrated uncertainty estimates negatively correlated with task accuracy and effectively separates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components.

Conclusion: First successful uncertainty quantification framework for video models that addresses critical safety gaps in generative video applications.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEO optimizes text embeddings in diffusion models to improve image quality from simple prompts without training, using a tripartite objective for aesthetics, embedding adherence, and prompt preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance aesthetic quality in text-to-image generation from simple, uncurated prompts without requiring model retraining or curated prompts.

Method: Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO) - a training-free method that optimizes text embeddings using a tripartite objective function: aesthetic improvement, embedding adherence, and prompt preservation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show PEO exceeds or equals state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods in performance.

Conclusion: PEO effectively improves image quality from simple prompts without training, demonstrating backbone-independent effectiveness in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel marker-less multi-camera system for accurate 3D hand tracking in unconstrained, real-world conditions, combining exocentric and egocentric views to bridge the gap between environmental realism and annotation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D hand tracking datasets are predominantly captured in controlled lab settings, limiting environmental diversity and model generalization for real-world applications.

Method: Developed a lightweight back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras plus a Meta Quest 3 headset providing two egocentric views, creating an ego-exo tracking pipeline for precise 3D hand pose ground truth.

Result: Successfully collected an annotated dataset with synchronized multi-view images and accurate 3D hand poses, demonstrating significant reduction in the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions while maintaining precise 3D hand tracking capabilities, advancing egocentric computer vision for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a distillation method that converts many-step diffusion models for co-speech video generation into few-step models, achieving real-time performance while maintaining quality through input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based co-speech video generation methods are too slow for real-time deployment due to numerous denoising steps and expensive attention mechanisms.

Method: Distill many-step diffusion video model into few-step student model using input human pose conditioning for attention and loss functions, with input-aware sparse attention and input-aware distillation loss.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods, with better lip synchronization and hand motion realism.

Conclusion: The proposed input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss effectively enable real-time co-speech video generation while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunLoRA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using rank-1 matrices with functional reparameterization to enable continual adaptation of generative models without catastrophic forgetting, requiring only current task data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual adaptation of generative models faces challenges with catastrophic forgetting and increasing training time. Existing approaches relying on synthetic data retraining lead to performance degradation and computational intractability.

Method: Proposes functional LoRA (FunLoRA) - a dynamic conditioning mechanism using rank-1 matrices with functional reparameterization to increase matrix rank. Uses flow-matching based models trained from scratch with parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Surpasses prior state-of-the-art diffusion model results, achieving higher classification accuracy while requiring only a fraction of memory cost and sampling time.

Conclusion: FunLoRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for generative models, providing superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic light and sign recognition that addresses temporal continuity and multistatic sensing vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles, achieving 79.8mAP and reducing attack success rate to 18.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic light and sign recognition is critical for autonomous vehicle safety, but current models are vulnerable to both digital adversarial attacks and natural perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, graffiti), lacking consideration of temporal continuity and multistatic field-of-view sensing.

Method: Proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework using a multi-source dataset from aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded Texas videos. Uses temporal alignment for four ODDs (highway, night, rainy, urban) and implements a unified three-layer defense stack with feature squeezing, defensive distillation, entropy-based anomaly detection, and sequence-wise temporal voting.

Result: The Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced attack success rate to 18.2%, outperforming YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer. It also reduced high-risk misclassification to 32% and confirmed physical transferability through recapture probes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances robustness for traffic light and sign recognition in autonomous vehicles by incorporating temporal continuity and multistatic sensing, providing superior protection against both digital and natural perturbations while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO is a novel method that optimizes noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models, enabling more efficient and stable training while improving reward optimization and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are deterministic and poorly suited for reinforcement learning, which is crucial for improving image quality and human alignment. Existing approaches using random noise perturbations are inefficient and unstable.

Method: Smart-GRPO employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions.

Result: Experiments show that Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO provides a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter enables fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images using end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization and geometry-enhanced optimization, outperforming SOTA methods on DTU and Replica datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense, calibrated views and perform poorly with free sparse images due to limited overlap and overfitting issues.

Method: Integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization using large Transformer for multi-view encoding, self-splitting Gaussian head, contribution-based pruning to remove floaters, and depth/multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica datasets.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter provides an effective solution for high-quality surface reconstruction from free sparse images through integrated dense initialization and geometry-enhanced optimization.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [13] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC is a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis, improving motion generation quality and enabling intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven motion generation methods are limited in capturing causal logic of action execution and human intentions, and lack visual grounding for fine-grained spatiotemporal details.

Method: Jointly optimizes multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, uses mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope for local alignment, and leverages a 440-hour benchmark dataset (Mo440H).

Result: Reduces FID by 38.6% on HumanML3D and 34.6% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning, and enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: MoGIC advances controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding by integrating intention modeling and visual priors into a unified multimodal framework.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

### [14] [From Tokens to Nodes: Semantic-Guided Motion Control for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02732)
*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-adaptive framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction that aligns control point density with motion complexity using semantic and motion priors, achieving better quality and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse control methods for dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos suffer from inefficient control point allocation - they use geometry-based allocation leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency.

Method: Uses semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models to establish patch-token-node correspondences, applies motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions, and employs iterative voxelization with motion tendency scoring. Also introduces spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets instead of MLP-based deformation fields.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-adaptive framework effectively addresses the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity in dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

*Weimin Yuan,Cai Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Net2Net combines untrained and pre-trained networks using regularization by denoising (RED) for real-world noise removal, achieving superior performance without requiring extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with real noise complexity, while deep learning methods need extensive labeled data and may not generalize well across diverse noise types.

Method: Hybrid framework combining unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) with supervised pre-trained DRUNet model using regularization by denoising (RED) - untrained network adapts to input-specific noise, pre-trained network provides robust learned representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance for real-world noise removal, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Conclusion: Net2Net effectively addresses real-world noise removal challenges by leveraging the complementary strengths of untrained and pre-trained networks, enhancing generalization across varying noise patterns.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

*Lanyun Zhu,Deyi Ji,Tianrun Chen,Haiyang Wu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1 is the first R1-style multimodal LLM for universal retrieval that uses step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy. It addresses computational cost and training instability issues through information compression and a new training paradigm with curriculum rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying DeepSeek-R1's RL methods to retrieval tasks is infeasible due to high computational costs from large token consumption and instability/suboptimal results when training RL for retrieval.

Method: Introduces information compression module with details inspection mechanism to reduce tokens while preserving critical information. Uses new training paradigm with activation stage using retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset, followed by RL with curriculum reward.

Result: Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables effective RL-based training for multimodal retrieval, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

### [17] [Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02750)
*Lihua Zhou,Mao Ye,Shuaifeng Li,Nianxin Li,Jinlin Wu,Xiatian Zhu,Lei Deng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCA+ is a training-free test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that uses Bayesian inference with dynamic cache updates to adapt both object recognition and detection without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods are either computationally expensive (requiring backpropagation) or only adapt likelihood while ignoring the important role of class priors, limiting their real-world deployment and effectiveness.

Method: BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales for detection, and adaptive class priors. It formulates adaptation as Bayesian inference, fusing initial VLM outputs with cache-based predictions that combine dynamically updated likelihoods and priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks while being highly efficient due to its training-free nature and no backpropagation requirement.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides a unified, efficient framework for test-time adaptation that successfully addresses both semantic understanding and contextual confidence through Bayesian inference with adaptive priors and likelihoods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

### [18] [Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760)
*Matthias Perkonigg,Patrick Rockenschaub,Georg Göbel,Adelheid Wöhrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGCD-BT is a novel hierarchical generalized category discovery method for brain tumor classification that improves accuracy by 28% over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in identifying unseen tumor categories across different imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor classification approaches are limited to fixed predefined classes and cannot handle unknown tumor types not seen during training, while unsupervised methods lack ability to incorporate labeled data knowledge.

Method: Integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning, extending contrastive learning based GCD with a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss to capture hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies.

Result: Achieved +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification on OpenSRH dataset, with strong performance in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Also demonstrated generalizability on slide-level classification using Digital Brain Tumor Atlas.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT effectively bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning for brain tumor classification, successfully categorizing both known and unknown tumor types while capturing hierarchical relationships across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

### [19] [AdaRD-key: Adaptive Relevance-Diversity Keyframe Sampling for Long-form Video understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02778)
*Xian Zhang,Zexi Wu,Zinuo Li,Hongming Xu,Luqi Gong,Farid Boussaid,Naoufel Werghi,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key is a training-free keyframe sampling module for long-form video understanding that combines query-conditioned relevance and diversity scoring to select informative, non-redundant frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long-form video understanding either use uniform sampling (missing critical moments) or rigid temporal spacing (missing fine-grained cues), while others focus on visual diversity but neglect query relevance.

Method: Proposes a unified Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume objective with query-conditioned relevance scoring and log-determinant diversity, plus a lightweight relevance-aware gating mechanism that shifts to diversity-only mode when query-video alignment is weak.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks, particularly for long-form videos, running in real time on a single GPU.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key provides an effective, training-free, plug-and-play solution for query-driven long-form video understanding that balances relevance and diversity while handling weak query-video alignment.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) approach rebus puzzles, revealing their cognitive processes through explainability analysis across six puzzle categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles, but the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored.

Method: Created a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, with an evaluation framework separating reasoning quality from answer correctness. Investigated three prompting strategies to elicit different explanatory processes.

Result: Reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories - models show strengths in visual composition but fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. Prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explainability is an integral component of model performance rather than a post-hoc consideration, with systematic patterns in VLM cognitive processes revealed through rebus puzzle analysis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new text removal benchmark dataset that addresses limitations in existing datasets by using synthetic text on complex backgrounds with clean ground truth, enabling better evaluation across domains beyond scene text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text removal datasets have limitations including ground truth artifacts from manual editing, simplistic backgrounds, and inadequate evaluation metrics that hinder out-of-domain generalization and accurate assessment of text removal quality.

Method: The approach synthesizes a text removal benchmark by rendering text on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language model-generated content to ensure clean ground truth and challenging scenarios.

Result: A new dataset is created that features text on complex backgrounds with clean ground truth, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks like SCUT-EnsText.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset provides a more robust benchmark for text removal tasks applicable to domains beyond scene text, with improved evaluation capabilities and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

*Ara Seo,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Hyungjin Chung,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for aligning object queries in DETR-style detectors with modality context using modality tokens and contrastive pretraining, enabling effective multimodality medical object detection without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical object detection struggles when trained on mixed modalities (CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces, requiring representation alignment.

Method: Proposes Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) to integrate modality tokens via self-attention, and QueryREPA pretraining with contrastive objective to align queries with modality tokens using modality-balanced batches.

Result: Consistently improves AP across diverse medical modalities with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, producing modality-aware, class-faithful queries.

Conclusion: Offers a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection by aligning object query representations with modality context through lightweight, detector-agnostic framework.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

TL;DR: MaskCD uses image head masking to create contrastive samples for reducing hallucinations in large vision-language models while preserving their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing hallucinations in LVLMs have limitations - contrastive decoding struggles with constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods lack stability and are highly sensitive.

Method: Proposed image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD) that utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs by masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding.

Result: Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b using benchmarks like CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. Results show MaskCD effectively alleviates hallucinations while retaining general capabilities of LVLMs.

Conclusion: MaskCD provides an effective approach to reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models through image head masking for contrastive decoding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation at small scales remains challenging, with few existing solutions capable of capturing 6 degrees of freedom with nanometric and microradian resolutions over large ranges. The need exists for reliable performance in various microscopy applications.

Method: The software uses phase-based processing of pseudo-periodic patterns with a phase-based local thresholding algorithm. It handles different pattern types addressing various application needs and provides implementation guidance for pattern selection and microscope magnification.

Result: VERNIER provides fast and reliable pose measurement with proven robustness to noise, defocus, and occlusion. It achieves nanometer resolutions using phase processing of periodic frames and centimeter ranges using pattern encoding methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive solution for high-precision pose estimation through phase processing of pseudo-periodic patterns, with guidelines for selecting appropriate pattern designs and microscope configurations based on desired performance requirements.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a

TL;DR: Med-K2N addresses K to N medical image synthesis by modeling heterogeneous modality contributions, ensuring fusion quality control, and maintaining modality identity consistency through progressive enhancement and causal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical necessity for flexible modality reconstruction in medical imaging, addressing challenges of heterogeneous modality contributions, fusion quality control, and modality identity consistency in multi-output generation.

Method: Treats multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection. Uses three modules: PreWeightNet (global contribution assessment), ThresholdNet (adaptive filtering), EffiWeightNet (effective weight computation), and Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) for vision-language causal constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-K2N framework effectively addresses key challenges in cross-modal medical image synthesis through progressive enhancement and causal modality identity preservation.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELMF4EggQ is an ensemble learning framework that uses multimodal feature fusion (image, shape, weight) to classify egg grade and freshness non-destructively, achieving 86.57% accuracy for grade classification and 70.83% for freshness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for food safety, product standards, and operational efficiency in commercial poultry production, addressing the need for methods that don't require internal measurements.

Method: Uses ensemble learning with multimodal feature fusion combining deep features from external egg images (ResNet152, DenseNet169, ResNet152V2) with structural characteristics (shape and weight), followed by PCA dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and ensemble voting of multiple ML classifiers.

Result: The multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular-only baselines, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction using only external, non-invasive features.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that machine learning can effectively assess internal egg quality using only external features, providing a non-destructive alternative to traditional methods, with all code and data publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-ioner is a zero-shot captioning framework that shifts from global image representations to patch-centric captioning, enabling arbitrary region captioning without region-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot captioners are limited to global image representations and whole-image captions, lacking the ability to describe specific regions or patches without additional supervision.

Method: Treats individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregates them to describe arbitrary regions (single patches, non-contiguous areas, entire images) using backbones like DINO that produce meaningful dense visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning tasks, outperforming other baselines and competitors.

Conclusion: Patch-wise semantic representations are effective for scalable caption generation, with dense visual features being key to successful zero-shot region-based captioning.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

TL;DR: MEACI-Net is a two-stream framework for compressed video action recognition that enhances motion representation and strengthens RGB-motion interaction through selective motion complement and cross-modality augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed video action recognition suffers from coarse/noisy motion dynamics and insufficient fusion of RGB and motion modalities, which limits performance despite reduced computational costs.

Method: Two-stream architecture with motion enhancement using multi-scale blocks and denoising, plus SMC to complement RGB with attentive motion features and CMA for selective cross-modality feature augmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: MEACI-Net successfully addresses motion quality and modality fusion issues in compressed video action recognition through enhanced motion representation and improved cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution from out-of-distribution regions without outlier supervision, proposing a simple training-free method using InternImage features and K-Means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, and the capability of large vision foundation models to detect out-of-distribution regions remains underexplored.

Method: A training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters.

Result: Achieves 50.02 Average Precision on RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on ADE-OoD benchmark with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: The results suggest a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize
well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direc- tion for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework that addresses limitations of attention-first pruning methods by distributing pruning budgets across spatial crops to maintain global visual context and prevent representational collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from computational overhead due to massive visual tokens, and existing attention-first pruning methods preserve semantically similar tokens, causing performance drops at high pruning ratios.

Method: HoloV rethinks token retention holistically by adaptively distributing pruning budgets across different spatial crops to ensure retained tokens capture global visual context rather than isolated features.

Result: HoloV achieves superior performance across tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. LLaVA1.5 with HoloV preserves 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: HoloV provides an effective solution for efficient MLLM inference by maintaining task-relevant information through holistic pruning strategy, achieving better efficiency-accuracy trade-offs than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAW (Confidence-Aware Weighting) improves zero-shot robustness in vision-language models through confidence-aware loss and feature alignment regularization, outperforming recent methods under strong attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, requiring enhanced robustness.

Method: CAW consists of two components: (1) Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling KL divergence, and (2) feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency between frozen and fine-tuned encoder features.

Result: CAW outperforms recent methods (PMG-AFT, TGA-ZSR) under strong attacks like AutoAttack on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets, while using less memory and improving both clean and robust accuracy.

Conclusion: CAW effectively enhances zero-shot robustness in vision-language models without sacrificing generalization, demonstrating superior performance against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: This study evaluates large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging with clinical data, showing that domain adaptation and multimodal integration significantly improve stroke risk stratification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a transparent, interpretable manner for clinicians.

Method: Proposed a framework using interview-style question sequences to evaluate LVLMs, adapted LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna to ultrasound domain using LoRA, and integrated multimodal tabular data as text.

Result: Zero-shot LVLMs performed poorly in risk classification, but domain adaptation with LoRA substantially improved stroke risk stratification. Multimodal data integration enhanced specificity and balanced accuracy, achieving competitive performance compared to CNN baselines.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise but have limitations in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, highlighting the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis use inefficient deep autoencoders with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies for feature separation.

Method: Proposes FDA-VAE that encodes input and target images into two latent distributions symmetric to standard normal distribution, using Y-shaped bidirectional training to separate shared and independent features.

Result: FDA-VAE significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while improving synthesis quality compared to existing deep autoencoder-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FDA-VAE provides an efficient and interpretable solution for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis with better parameter efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LPG-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark with 200 long prompts (250+ words) to evaluate text-to-image models on long-prompt understanding, revealing limitations in current evaluation metrics and leading to the development of TIT - a novel zero-shot metric based on text-to-image-to-text consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with understanding and following long, detailed prompts despite generating high-quality images from short prompts, creating inconsistent generation results.

Method: Created LPG-Bench with 200 long prompts, generated 2,600 images from 13 models, performed human-ranked annotations, and developed TIT metric that compares prompt consistency with LMM-generated descriptions of images.

Result: Existing T2I evaluation metrics show poor consistency with human preferences on long prompts. TIT-Score-LLM achieves 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: LPG-Bench and TIT provide better tools for benchmarking and advancing text-to-image models, particularly for long-prompt understanding, with all resources to be made publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DEditFormer is a new framework for 3D editing that introduces both a large dataset (3DEditVerse) and a transformer-based model that enables precise 3D edits without requiring manual 3D masks, addressing challenges of cross-view consistency and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing remains challenging compared to 2D editing due to cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability requirements. Existing approaches are slow, prone to distortions, or dependent on error-prone manual 3D masks.

Method: Proposes 3DEditFormer, a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating. Also introduces 3DEditVerse dataset with 116,309 training pairs built through pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables precise and consistent 3D edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks, making 3D editing more practical and scalable.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses land cover segmentation challenges in tropical regions by developing cloud injection algorithms and proposing a lightweight NDI injection method to improve model performance under cloud-covered conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sentinel-2 datasets are mostly cloud-free, limiting their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are common. There's also a problem of losing spatial/spectral details during encoder downsampling in deep networks.

Method: Developed cloud injection algorithm to simulate realistic cloud cover, and proposed injecting Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into final decoding layers to retain key spatial features with minimal computation. Also tested Sentinel-1 radar data fusion with optical imagery.

Result: NDI injection improved land cover segmentation by 1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under cloud-covered conditions, Sentinel-1 data fusion led to significant performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address cloud coverage challenges in tropical regions and improve land cover segmentation performance, with radar-optical fusion proving particularly valuable in challenging atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RealSR methods using large generative models have high computational costs and latency, making them impractical for edge deployment on devices like mobile phones.

Method: Uses LiteED (97.5% parameter reduction from original VAE) for efficient encoding/decoding, online annealing pruning for U-Net to shift generative priors to lightweight modules, and multi-layer feature distillation loss to preserve knowledge during pruning.

Result: PocketSR achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art single-step and multi-step RealSR models while being highly efficient - 146M parameters, 0.8 seconds for 4K images.

Conclusion: PocketSR provides a highly practical solution for edge-device applications by balancing computational efficiency with high-quality super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Method: Created MEve prompt suite for evaluation and conducted systematic study of OpenSora and CogVideoX models, focusing on early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers.

Result: Experiments revealed the importance of early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers for controlling event transitions in multi-event video generation.

Conclusion: The study identifies essential factors for multi-event video generation and highlights possibilities for multi-event conditioning in future T2V models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging

multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand mechanisms that enable or inhibit compositional generalization in visual generative models, as this ability to generate novel combinations of known concepts is crucial but not fully understood.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to study design choices, identified key factors (training objective type and conditioning information), and proposed relaxing MaskGIT's discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective.

Result: Identified that training objective operating on discrete vs continuous distributions and the extent of conditioning information during training significantly influence compositional generalization performance.

Conclusion: Relaxing discrete models like MaskGIT with auxiliary continuous objectives can improve compositional generalization, providing insights for better visual generative model design.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

TL;DR: Proposes a latent space perturbation method for diffusion models to create "unlearnable" training samples that resist unauthorized personalization while maintaining visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage of personalization techniques in text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: Model-based perturbation strategy in latent space of diffusion models, alternating between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of denoising trajectory (trajectory-shifted sampling).

Result: Achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility (8-10% on PSNR, SSIM, FID) and robustness (10% average across five adversarial settings) against state-of-the-art inversion attacks on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Effective defense against unauthorized model adaptation by integrating unlearnability into Latent Diffusion Models framework, providing practical and imperceptible protection for sensitive data.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: Geometry-grounded semantic features contain finer structural details but surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy in radiance field inversion, while visual-only features offer greater versatility for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether geometry-grounded semantic features provide advantages over visual-only features in distilled radiance fields for spatial tasks like pose estimation, given that prior work focused mainly on visual-only features.

Method: Proposed SPINE framework for radiance field inversion without initial guess, consisting of coarse inversion using distilled semantics and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Compared geometry-grounded vs visual-only features across three critical questions.

Result: Geometry-grounded features contain finer structural details but show no significant difference in semantic object localization and surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy. Visual-only features offer greater versatility for broader downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Geometry-grounded features contain more geometric detail but visual-only features are more versatile. Future research is needed on effective strategies for geometry-grounding that can augment the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [43] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete is a novel framework for reference-driven image completion that uses explicit 3D structural guidance to ensure geometric consistency, outperforming existing methods by 17.1 PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for image completion rely only on diffusion priors without geometric cues, leading to misaligned or implausible content when target views differ significantly from references.

Method: Uses a dual-branch diffusion architecture with one branch synthesizing missing regions and another extracting geometric features from projected point clouds, plus target-aware masking to focus on relevant reference cues.

Result: Achieves 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: GeoComplete provides a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion by integrating geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion with target-aware masking.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

*Kaisi Guan,Xihua Wang,Zhengfeng Lai,Xin Cheng,Peng Zhang,XiaoJiang Liu,Ruihua Song,Meng Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation that addresses modal interference and cross-modal interaction challenges through hierarchical captioning and a dual-tower diffusion transformer with bidirectional attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2SV methods face modal interference when using shared text captions for both video and audio, and lack clear mechanisms for effective cross-modal feature interaction between visual and audio modalities.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) to generate disentangled video and audio captions, and BridgeDiT - a dual-tower diffusion transformer with Dual CrossAttention (DCA) for bidirectional cross-modal information exchange.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets with human evaluations, demonstrating effective semantic and temporal synchronization between video and audio.

Conclusion: The proposed HVGC and BridgeDiT framework successfully addresses key challenges in T2SV generation, offering valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR model reconstructs visual information from brain activity by separating visual cortex into hierarchical regions, using structural and semantic features with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex visual stimuli due to heterogeneity in low-level features and semantic entanglement in high-level features of natural scenes.

Method: Separates visual cortex into two hierarchical regions: Structural Generator extracts structural info from spatial voxels as diffusion priors, and Semantic Extractor converts semantic voxels into CLIP embeddings, integrated via Versatile Diffusion model.

Result: HAVIR enhances both structural and semantic quality of reconstructions in complex scenes and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach inspired by visual cortex representation theory effectively addresses challenges in brain activity-based visual reconstruction.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

*Gen Li,Bo Zhao,Jianfei Yang,Laura Sevilla-Lara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV is a two-stage framework for generating interaction-centric videos without requiring dense mask annotations, using predicted motion trajectories for actors and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex interactions and require dense mask annotations, which are challenging to obtain for real-world use.

Method: Decoupled two-stage pipeline: first predicts motion trajectories for actor and object, then generates video conditioned on these trajectories.

Result: Achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines across human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: Mask2IV provides an effective solution for interaction-centric video generation with flexible control and eliminates the need for dense mask inputs.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the

TL;DR: SpineMed introduces the first large-scale multimodal dataset (SpineMed-450k) for vertebral-level reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI, along with SpineBench evaluation framework, addressing the lack of level-aware spine datasets for AI-assisted diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, but AI-assisted diagnosis is limited by the absence of level-aware, multimodal datasets and standardized benchmarks for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities.

Method: Created SpineMed-450k dataset with 450,000 instruction instances using clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with two-stage LLM generation (draft and revision), curated from textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 hospital cases. Developed SpineBench evaluation framework for clinical assessment.

Result: Evaluation of advanced LVLMs on SpineBench revealed systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. The model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrated consistent and significant improvements across all tasks, with clinician assessments confirming diagnostic clarity and practical utility.

Conclusion: SpineMed addresses critical gaps in spine AI by providing the first large-scale level-aware multimodal dataset and clinically-grounded evaluation framework, enabling improved AI-assisted diagnosis for spine disorders through enhanced vertebral-level reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

TL;DR: UniShield is a multi-agent unified system for detecting and localizing image forgeries across multiple domains, using a perception agent to dynamically select detection models and a detection agent to consolidate expert detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic images are becoming increasingly realistic, posing risks like misinformation and fraud, while existing detection methods are too specialized and lack cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes UniShield with two agents: perception agent analyzes image features to select suitable detection models, and detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both unified approaches and domain-specific detectors.

Conclusion: UniShield demonstrates superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability for detecting image forgeries across diverse domains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Motivation: To create relightable 3D models that can realistically simulate object appearance under novel lighting conditions, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require per-illumination optimization.

Method: Samples object appearance under multiple lighting environments, trains a lighting-conditioned NeRF with dual-branch architecture to encode general lighting effects and specularities separately.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets across most metrics, and successfully demonstrates real-world object capture relighting.

Conclusion: ROGR provides an efficient framework for relightable 3D reconstruction that enables feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring light transport simulation.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scalable vector encoding for latent representations in high-fidelity image generation by combining product quantization with the established VQGAN framework.

Method: Developed PQGAN by integrating product quantization into VQGAN's vector quantization framework, with thorough analysis of codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorization interactions.

Result: Achieved 37dB PSNR (vs 27dB prior), reduced FID, LPIPS, and CMMD scores by up to 96%, and enabled seamless integration with pre-trained diffusion models for faster generation or doubled resolution.

Conclusion: Product quantization is a strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis, providing superior performance and practical benefits for image generation pipelines.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: Memory Forcing is a learning framework for autoregressive video diffusion models that improves long-term spatial consistency in world modeling applications like Minecraft gameplay by combining temporal and spatial memory with specialized training protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models face a trade-off between spatial consistency and new scene generation quality - temporal-only memory lacks long-term consistency while spatial memory can degrade new scene generation when over-relied upon.

Method: Uses Memory Forcing with geometry-indexed spatial memory, Hybrid Training for distinct gameplay regimes, Chained Forward Training with model rollouts, Point-to-Frame Retrieval for efficient history access, and Incremental 3D Reconstruction for maintaining an explicit 3D cache.

Result: Achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Conclusion: Memory Forcing effectively balances the trade-off between spatial consistency and new scene generation, enabling faithful simulation of gameplay with both natural content generation during exploration and spatial consistency during revisits.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks tools to evaluate alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text), and surrounding context (scene), despite the intuitive relationship between intention-driven movement and environmental support.

Method: Constructs a unified latent space by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal representations, inspired by higher-order relations modeling to capture intricate dependencies between modalities.

Result: Outperforms trimodal models relying solely on unimodal representations, with retrieval scores aligned with human preferences. Demonstrates versatility on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: MonSTeR successfully bridges the gap between motion, scene, and text modalities through a unified latent space, enabling robust cross-modal retrieval and validating alignment with human perception.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free test-time defense method that uses stochastic resonance to combat adversarial attacks by introducing small translational perturbations, aligning feature embeddings, and aggregating them without requiring additional modules or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods rely on feature filtering or smoothing which can cause information loss. The paper aims to develop a defense mechanism that enhances robustness while minimizing information loss.

Method: Introduces small translational perturbations to input images, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, aggregates them, and maps back to the original reference image using a closed-form formula that works across different network architectures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art robustness: recovers up to 68.1% of accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The method provides a versatile, practical, and attack-agnostic defense that works for both image classification and dense prediction tasks without requiring training or architecture modifications.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of

*Ricardo T. Fares,Lucas C. Ribas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixer is a novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning that uses hyperspherical random embeddings and a dual-branch module to capture intra- and inter-channel relationships, achieving strong results on texture benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized neural networks for texture recognition have focused mainly on cross-information prediction without significant architectural improvements, leaving room for better texture representation learning.

Method: Proposes Mixer with hyperspherical random embeddings and a dual-branch learning module to capture intra- and inter-channel relationships, enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for building rich texture representations.

Result: Experimental results show interesting performance across several pure texture benchmarks with distinct characteristics and challenges.

Conclusion: Mixer demonstrates promising results for texture representation learning through its novel randomized architecture combining hyperspherical embeddings and dual-branch learning.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

### [57] [Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230)
*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULER tokens and Interleaved MRoPE to improve GUI grounding accuracy by providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit position-to-pixel mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with GUI grounding due to unreliable patch-to-pixel mapping, especially when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training, leading to accuracy degradation.

Method: Two innovations: 1) RULER tokens as explicit coordinate markers for position referencing, 2) Interleaved MRoPE for improved spatial encoding by ensuring equal representation of width and height dimensions.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces.

Conclusion: By providing explicit spatial guidance instead of implicit learning, the approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

*Ci-Siang Lin,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Yang Sheng,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAML is a label-efficient adaptation framework for MLLMs that uses pseudo QA generation and selective neuron updates to improve performance on specialized domains with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with out-of-distribution tasks in specialized domains like medical imaging where labeled data is scarce and expensive, creating a need for efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation, and selectively updates only neurons most relevant to question-answering.

Result: Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA show LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision.

Conclusion: LEAML effectively enables MLLMs to acquire domain-specific knowledge with limited labeled data through pseudo QA generation and selective neuron updates.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena is a live open-web evaluation platform for LLM web agents that identifies three key failure modes through step-level human feedback and head-to-head comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent evaluations are limited to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks, lacking real-world open-web testing.

Method: Created BrowserArena platform with user-submitted tasks, Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and step-level human feedback analysis to identify failure modes.

Result: Identified three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct URL navigation. Found model-specific variations - o4-mini uses diverse captcha strategies while DeepSeek-R1 misleads users about captcha resolution.

Conclusion: Current web agents show both diversity and brittleness. The benchmarking methodology enables scalable evaluation and understanding of web agent failure modes.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL model for cinematography understanding, and introduces RefineShot - a refined benchmark with improved evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguous option design in ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency, which undermine evaluation reliability and hinder fair comparison in cinematography understanding.

Method: Systematically refine ShotBench through consistent option restructuring, conduct critical analysis of ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce extended evaluation protocol assessing both task accuracy and core model competencies.

Result: Developed RefineShot - a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable assessment of cinematography understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: RefineShot addresses previous limitations and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding through improved evaluation reliability and comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a method to limit performance degradation from harmful in-context demonstrations in LLMs using distribution-free risk control and dynamic early exit prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns where LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious demonstrations, requiring built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks.

Method: Define baseline safe behavior (zero-shot performance), apply distribution-free risk control to limit performance decay, and use dynamic early exit prediction to ignore attention heads that attend to unsafe inputs.

Result: Effectively controls risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while achieving computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.

Conclusion: The approach provides principled protection against harmful demonstrations while maintaining performance benefits from helpful ones.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

*Shuhao Fu,Esther Goldberg,Ying Nian Wu,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies specific attention heads in OpenFlamingo-4B that encode spatial relations, extracts 'function vectors' from them, and shows these vectors can be manipulated to improve relational reasoning performance without retraining the full model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind Large Multimodal Models' in-context learning abilities, particularly how they encode and process spatial relational knowledge.

Method: Applied causal mediation analysis to identify key attention heads for spatial relations, extracted multimodal function vectors from these heads, and fine-tuned these vectors while keeping the LMM parameters frozen.

Result: Function vectors improved zero-shot accuracy, outperformed in-context learning baselines when fine-tuned, and could be linearly combined to solve analogy problems with novel spatial relations.

Conclusion: LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge in localized internal structures that can be systematically extracted and optimized, advancing understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing complex multi-agent workflows remains challenging, requiring systems that can orchestrate collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams.

Method: Formalizes workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game, proposes Autonomous Manager Agent concept, and develops MA-Gym - an open-source simulation framework for evaluating multi-agent workflow orchestration.

Result: Evaluation of GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows shows they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime, highlighting workflow management as a difficult open problem.

Conclusion: The paper identifies workflow management as a significant challenge and discusses organizational and ethical implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Motivation: Container stowage planning traditionally relies on human expertise, and while RL has been applied, there's a lack of systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms in this domain.

Method: Developed a Gym environment capturing CSPP fundamentals with crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations, then evaluated five RL algorithms under multiple scenarios of varying complexity.

Result: Results showed distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, highlighting the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP.

Conclusion: The paper provides a benchmark for RL methods in CSPP and offers a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, serving as a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Result: Validated with real-world data, the framework effectively generates context-aware alerts for critical situations like proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting transportation systems and electric networks through scalable coordination and energy planning.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to

effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such

### [67] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models struggle with cross-modal reasoning, especially when conflicting evidence appears across different modalities. They show attention imbalance that doesn't improve with scaling alone, but can be fixed with explicit cross-modal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well foundation models perform joint reasoning across multiple modalities, particularly when modalities contain conflicting evidence that requires reconciliation.

Method: Study cross-modal conflicts where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. Analyze attention patterns and propose a simple method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each training instance to reduce attention imbalance.

Result: FMs recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts 90% of the time, but this drops to as low as 3% when evidence is split across modalities. Cross-modal attention imbalance is identified as the root cause, and the proposed training method significantly reduces this imbalance and improves performance on vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematically addressing cross-modal contexts is crucial for building reliable foundation models, as current models show significant attention imbalance that requires explicit training strategies rather than just scaling datasets.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (TTS) with multiple reasoning traces reaches a performance plateau at large sample sizes, but scaling along temperature dimension instead of just sample count significantly improves reasoning performance by exploring different subsets of problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed that increasing the number of reasoning samples (K) in test-time scaling steadily improves accuracy, but this trend doesn't hold indefinitely - hard questions remain unsolved regardless of K, suggesting current TTS approaches are limited.

Method: Proposed temperature scaling instead of single-temperature scaling, where different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems. Also designed a multi-temperature voting method to reduce overhead.

Result: Temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS across Qwen3 models (0.6B-8B) and five reasoning benchmarks. Enables base models to reach performance comparable to RL-trained counterparts without additional post-training.

Conclusion: TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models by exploring different reasoning boundaries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept of possibility as an alternative to Zadeh's standard possibility theory, focusing specifically on real-world events with prerequisites and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to Zadeh's possibility theory that specifically addresses the possibility of real-world events, particularly for planning problems where multiple plans are available.

Method: Events are viewed as having prerequisites (enabling factors) and constraints (impeding factors). Possibility is computed as a function of probabilities that prerequisites hold and constraints do not hold, using Łukasiewicz multivalent logic.

Result: The theory provides a method to determine which plan is most possible (easiest or most feasible) when multiple plans are available for achieving a goal, with an illustrative example for vehicle route planning.

Conclusion: This new possibility concept may correctly capture normal human reasoning about plans and has potential applications in planning problems, with suggestions for future applications.

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Result: Achieves 1.0-7.1% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks, with superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models through self-evolving architecture search.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

### [72] [ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02677)
*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs is an adaptive red-teaming agent that automatically optimizes diverse attack strategies to systematically evaluate safety vulnerabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates and generating a large-scale multimodal safety dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM safety evaluation methods are limited in scope and scalability, lacking comprehensive exploration of emerging real-world vulnerabilities in multimodal interfaces.

Method: ARMs uses reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration with 11 novel multimodal attack strategies and 17 red-teaming algorithms integrated via model context protocol (MCP), featuring layered memory and epsilon-greedy attack exploration for balanced diversity and effectiveness.

Result: ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates, exceeding baselines by 52.1% on average and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. It generates significantly more diverse red-teaming instances and constructs ARMs-Bench, a 30K+ instance multimodal safety dataset spanning 51 risk categories.

Conclusion: ARMs provides scalable and comprehensive VLM safety evaluation, and safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves VLM robustness while preserving general utility, offering actionable guidance for multimodal safety alignment.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs for reliable automated constraint specification in production scheduling, addressing challenges of natural language ambiguity and non-deterministic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual constraint specification for manufacturing scheduling is labor-intensive, and direct LLM application faces challenges due to ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited domain knowledge.

Method: Hierarchical structural space across three levels with domain-specific representation, plus automated production scenario adaptation algorithm for customization.

Result: Significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches in constraint specification tasks, balancing LLM generative capabilities with manufacturing reliability requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully enables reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling by regulating LLMs while maintaining flexibility.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NCV is a training-free framework that verifies LLM reasoning via lightweight binary consistency checks at node level, improving error localization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods suffer from imprecise error localization, attention dilution, and high token costs from multi-sampling or assessing entire reasoning chains.

Method: Decompose chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes and perform binary consistency checks at each node, avoiding long-form generation.

Result: Achieves 10-25% F1 score improvement over baselines while using 6×-58× fewer tokens than traditional CoT-based verifiers.

Conclusion: NCV provides a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification with enhanced interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents that assesses reasoning trajectories beyond just final answers, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented benchmarks only evaluate final answers, ignoring important aspects like efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity in problem-solving trajectories. Ground-truth trajectory annotation is expensive, and simple LLM evaluators struggle without ground truth.

Method: TRACE incorporates an evidence bank that accumulates knowledge from preceding reasoning steps, enabling multi-faceted analysis of agent trajectories. A meta-evaluation dataset was created by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse flawed trajectories labeled with multi-faceted performance scores.

Result: TRACE accurately evaluates complex agent behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. The framework provides previously unreported observations and insights about agent performance on tool-augmented tasks.

Conclusion: TRACE addresses the limitations of current evaluation methods by providing comprehensive trajectory assessment, enabling better understanding and improvement of tool-augmented LLM agents' problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA) in machine learning, arguing that training doesn't guarantee models satisfy their specified objectives due to approximation, estimation, and optimization errors, plus inevitable misspecification of human intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the overlooked assumption that training yields models satisfying their specified objectives, and to highlight the risks when this assumption fails under strong optimization pressure.

Method: Uses a learning-paradigm-agnostic framework to analyze how approximation, estimation, and optimization errors cause systematic deviations from intended objectives, and connects these gaps to Goodhart's law failure modes.

Result: Shows that OSA fails in realistic conditions, and absent mathematical characterization of objective gaps, continued optimization can lead to Goodhart's law failures and irreversible loss of control in AI systems.

Conclusion: A principled limit on optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary to prevent predictable loss of control, as the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located beforehand.

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

*Xinle Wu,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianRouter is a hybrid framework that combines offline learning of reward model strengths with online Bayesian selection to dynamically route queries to the most appropriate reward model from a pool, improving alignment quality while maintaining O(1) RM calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF/RLAIF pipelines rely on single reward models, limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Existing RM routing methods suffer from cold-start problems and insufficient exploration.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Offline stage trains multi-task router on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability; (2) Online stage uses Bayesian Thompson sampling with Gaussian priors initialized from offline embeddings, adaptively updating posteriors with online rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: BayesianRouter effectively addresses cold-start and exploration issues in RM routing, providing a robust framework for improving LLM alignment quality through dynamic reward model selection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

TL;DR: MaskGRPO is the first viable approach for scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion models, addressing challenges with importance sampling and rollout complexity through theoretical foundations and modality-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing discrete diffusion models with rewards is challenging due to non-autoregressive paradigm making importance sampling intractable and rollout complex, which puzzles existing reinforcement learning methods like GRPO.

Method: Introduced MaskGRPO with theoretical foundation for DDMs to build importance estimator capturing token fluctuation, and tailored rollout method for visual sequences to yield diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients.

Result: On math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO establishes as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how different explainable AI (XAI) methods incorporate distinct ontological and epistemological assumptions about explanations, which significantly impact the validity and interpretation of AI explanations across different application domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods are black-box systems that lack explanations, limiting trustworthiness. XAI methods are developed with technical assumptions about explanations, but the fundamental concept of explanation is complex and philosophical. These assumptions have important consequences for explanation validity.

Method: The authors investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in XAI methods - examining assumptions about the existence of explanations and our ability to know them. They analyze how technical changes in XAI methods correspond to different underlying assumptions about explanations.

Result: The analysis reveals that seemingly minor technical modifications to XAI methods can represent significant differences in fundamental assumptions about explanations. Different XAI methods incorporate distinct onto-epistemological paradigms that affect explanation validity.

Conclusion: Ignoring the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when selecting XAI methods poses risks. The paper provides guidance on how to select and adapt appropriate XAI methods for different application domains based on their underlying assumptions about explanations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

TL;DR: First formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations for rule-based smart environments, showing contextual user preferences between counterfactual and causal explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No established methods exist for generating counterfactual explanations in rule-based smart environments, despite explainability being essential and counterfactuals being powerful tools in XAI.

Method: Developed a formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations as a plugin extending an existing explanation engine, then conducted a user study (N=17) comparing counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations.

Result: User preference is highly contextual - causal explanations preferred for linguistic simplicity and time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals preferred for actionable content when users want to resolve problems.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for counterfactual explanations in smart environments and empirical evidence guiding when each explanation type is most effective.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

TL;DR: This study investigates AI systems' abstract reasoning capabilities on Raven's Progressive Matrices by deliberately omitting structural rules during training, revealing limitations in current models' generalization to novel rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether AI models' success on RPM tasks reflects genuine reasoning ability or reliance on statistical shortcuts, and to assess generalization capacity under incomplete training conditions.

Method: Evaluated sequence-to-sequence transformers and vision-based architectures (CoPINet, Dual-Contrast Network) on I-RAVEN dataset with deliberately omitted structural rules during training.

Result: Transformers showed strong performance on familiar rules but sharp accuracy decline on novel/omitted rules; significant gap between token-level and complete answer accuracy revealed fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: Current approaches have fundamental limitations in abstract reasoning, highlighting the need for architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

TL;DR: CoDA is a multi-agent system that automates data visualization from natural language queries, addressing challenges with complex datasets and iterative refinement through specialized LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visualization automation systems struggle with complex multi-file datasets, iterative refinement, and robust error handling, requiring manual intervention despite advances in AI.

Method: CoDA employs a collaborative multi-agent approach with specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection, using a formalized pipeline that bypasses token limits and ensures quality.

Result: Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%.

Conclusion: The future of visualization automation lies in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows rather than isolated code generation.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions but suffer from trainability issues. The paper proposes CCDD - a joint multimodal diffusion process that combines continuous representation space and discrete token space to achieve both expressiveness and good sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the contradiction between theoretical expressiveness of continuous diffusion models and their empirical underperformance compared to discrete counterparts, particularly the difficulty in decoding continuous representations back to discrete token space.

Method: Proposes Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD) - a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of continuous representation space and discrete token space, using a single model to simultaneously denoise in both spaces.

Result: CCDD achieves strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks, demonstrating both expressiveness with rich semantics in latent space and good trainability with explicit discrete tokens.

Conclusion: By combining continuous and discrete modalities, CCDD successfully bridges the gap between theoretical expressiveness and practical trainability in diffusion language models, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional single-stage VQ approaches that require exponentially larger codebooks for higher fidelity, leading to computational complexity and codebook collapse problems.

Method: Decomposes quantization into multiple stages with dynamic activation of stages and individual VQ modules, formulates module selection as optimization problem solved with incremental allocation algorithm, and incorporates entropy coding.

Result: Outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods on CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity and flexible fine-grained rate control.

Conclusion: MSVQ-SC framework provides effective solution for rate-adaptive semantic communication with improved performance and reduced complexity compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic
communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed
\textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require
exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed
framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and
dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design
enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while
mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To
optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes
task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental
allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating
entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing
communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate
that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication
methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while
providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.

*Anish Pradhan,Lingjia Liu,Harpreet S. Dhillon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AMIF-MDS method uses aggregate mutual information and multidimensional scaling to identify dependencies in O-RAN performance measurements, reducing testing complexity by focusing on core metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN testing complexity grows exponentially with system size, making it crucial to identify dependencies among performance measurements to simplify testing and improve system design.

Method: Proposes AMIF-MDS using aggregate mutual information in frequency as a proxy for directed information, combined with multidimensional scaling and DBSCAN clustering to group mutually informative metrics.

Result: Successfully identifies link-adaptation indicators and yields a core performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN testing by visualizing inter-series dependencies.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces testing complexity in O-RAN systems by focusing on core performance measures through dependency analysis of time-series data.

Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially
growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex,
with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations
and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design
for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various
performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled
as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized
as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust
estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains
challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual
Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information
(DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with
multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is
applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among
various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''
performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications
with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics,
organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and
yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN
testing.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A DDPM-based channel estimation algorithm that performs both denoising and data augmentation for CSI estimation, with a piecewise forward strategy to handle varying SNRs, achieving better precision-computation tradeoff than benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address severe noise in raw signals at pilot locations that impairs channel estimation accuracy, and overcome data scarcity for training deep learning networks for CSI estimation.

Method: Unsupervised DDPM structure for denoising field data without pure channel knowledge, and data augmentation by adjusting reverse steps to generate new channel data. Uses piecewise forward strategy to handle varying SNRs.

Result: Link-level simulations show the proposed scheme achieves superior tradeoff between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The dual application DDPM-based approach effectively addresses both noise reduction and data augmentation needs for channel estimation, providing improved performance with practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data
denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals
at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An
unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge
of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the
data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state
information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by
adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward
strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level
simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff
between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: A novel multi-tag detection scheme for zero-energy devices in ambient backscatter systems using Near-Perfect Codes to improve synchronization and separability among concurrent tags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting multiple coexisting zero-energy devices under interference and synchronization uncertainty in ambient backscatter communication systems.

Method: Proposed a detector using Near-Perfect Code as synchronization sequence to improve peak-to-sidelobe ratio, replacing dual band-pass filtering with dual correlators, and incorporating contrast metric with multi-frequency combining.

Result: Experimental results on CorteXlab testbed show robustness at low SNR with PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme advances scalable and reliable ambient backscatter localization in practical multi-tag environments.

Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on
Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter
communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in
ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty.
Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag
detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core
idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which
substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability
among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering
with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control
of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and
multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the
CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at
low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These
results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in
practical multi-tag environments.

theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems,
the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems,
posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries
are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing

software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows
for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular
architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for integrated sensing, communication, and positioning in vehicular networks where these functions are typically handled separately, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Discretize ROI into sensing/positioning pixels, exploit both LOS and NLOS propagation, formulate as polynomial bilinear compressed sensing problem, and solve using alternating optimization algorithm.

Result: The proposed method effectively achieves simultaneous symbol detection, vehicle positioning, and environment sensing with demonstrated performance through analysis and numerical results.

Conclusion: The integrated framework successfully solves the coupled problem of sensing, communication, and positioning in vehicular networks using compressed sensing techniques and alternating optimization.

Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning,
and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By
incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing
computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated
sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are
highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we
discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels
respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is
shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction
problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to
iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment
sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional

epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb
nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously

recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation
patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves
were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular
organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the
combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one

linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately
contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic
applications.

Method: Developed ADMM-CMS framework using alternating direction method of multipliers with adaptive algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged, applied to uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols.

Result: Achieved 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for 0.9 SRP compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, and 35%/38.1% reduction in delay RMSE at 7 GHz/10 GHz sub-bands compared to separate compressed sensing.

Conclusion: ADMM-CMS is an efficient enabler of ISAC in FR3 (7-24 GHz) for 6G systems, demonstrating superior performance in multiband sensing applications.

Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich
channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical
beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed
multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel
framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To
solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to
noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the
decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian
methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization.
Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved
denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in
per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability
(SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the
constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay
root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna
transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate
ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Neural Polar Decoders from synthetic channels to practical communication systems, addressing real-world requirements like variable code lengths, higher-order modulations, and diverse channel conditions.

Method: Adapted NPDs for OFDM and single-carrier systems with rate matching for any code length, support for higher-order modulations, and operation directly on channels with memory without pilots or cyclic prefix.

Result: NPDs consistently outperform 5G polar decoders in BER, BLER, and throughput, particularly for low-rate and short-block configurations. Single-carrier NPDs achieve comparable performance to OFDM with lower PAPR.

Conclusion: NPDs are positioned as high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solutions suitable for practical communication systems, despite higher computational complexity than standard 5G polar decoders.

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel distance function derived from probability densities that connects information theory and estimation theory through denoising errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a metric that adapts to the geometry of signal distributions by leveraging the fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, particularly using denoising errors.

Method: IEM is computed by comparing denoising error vectors over noise amplitudes, using score vector fields of blurred densities. It can be implemented with learned denoisers and solved via one-dimensional integration.

Result: IEM is proven to be a valid global metric and reduces to Mahalanobis distance for Gaussian distributions. On ImageNet, it competes with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Conclusion: IEM provides an effective framework for learning adaptive distance metrics that capture distribution geometry and perform well in practical applications like image quality assessment.

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates high-resolution single pixel imaging using a van der Waals material photodetector, achieving 1023×768 pixels for visible light and 512×512 for extended shortwave infrared, with compressed sampling that reduces imaging time by 4x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution infrared imagers are expensive due to costly sensor arrays. Van der Waals materials offer low-cost, room temperature infrared photodetectors, but creating megapixel arrays has been challenging. Single pixel imaging provides an affordable alternative using only one photodetector.

Method: Uses a black phosphorus-molybdenum disulfide (bP-MoS₂) photodiode with compressed sampling based on a cyclic S-matrix derived from Hadamard-based sequences. Implements circular convolution and Fourier transforms for efficient reconstruction, plus an edge detection method for rapid feature extraction.

Result: Achieved SPI with 1023×768 pixels for visible light and 512×512 for extended shortwave infrared, surpassing previous vdWs material SPI implementations by 64x in pixel count. Reduced imaging time by a factor of four while preserving key image features.

Conclusion: The method enables inexpensive shortwave infrared and midwave infrared cameras, potentially advancing applications in gas detection, biomedical imaging, autonomous driving, security, and surveillance.

Abstract: High-resolution infrared imagers are currently more expensive than CMOS and
CCD cameras, due to costly sensor arrays. Van der Waals (vdWs) materials
present an opportunity for low-cost, room temperature infrared photodetectors.
Although photodetectors based on vdWs materials show promising performance,
creating a megapixel array is yet to be achieved. Imaging with a single vdWs
photodetector typically relies on time-consuming mechanical scanning and
suffers from low resolution. Single pixel imaging (SPI) offers an affordable
alternative to achieve high-resolution imaging, utilizing only one
photodetector and a spatial light modulator. Progress in SPI using vdWs
material photodetectors has been limited, with only one prior demonstration in
the near infrared range (64$\times$64 pixels). In this work, we demonstrate a
high-resolution SPI system (1023$\times$768 for visible light and
512$\times$512 for extended shortwave infrared) using a black
phosphorus-molybdenum disulfide (bP-MoS$_2$) photodiode, surpassing earlier
vdWs material SPI implementations by a factor of 64 in pixel count. We
introduce an easy-to-implement edge detection method for rapid feature
extraction. We employ compressed sampling and reduce imaging time by a factor
of four. Our compressed sampling approach is based on a cyclic S-matrix, which
is derived from a Hadamard-based sequence, where each row is a circular shift
of the first row. This enables efficient imaging reconstruction via circular
convolution and Fourier transforms, allowing fewer measurements while
preserving the key image features. Our method for SPI using a vdWs material
photodetector presents the opportunity for inexpensive shortwave infrared and
midwave infrared cameras, and thus may enable advances in gas detection,
biomedical imaging, autonomous driving, security, and surveillance.

TL;DR: A novel image enhancement method using pigment representation that transforms RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments for adaptive content-based enhancement, achieving superior performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods are limited to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, lacking adaptability to input content. This paper aims to create a more flexible and expressive color transformation method.

Method: Transform RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, reproject and blend them individually in pigment space, then transform back to RGB. Parameters are adaptively estimated by a visual encoder based on input image content.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in image retouching and tone mapping tasks, with relatively low computational complexity and small model size.

Conclusion: The pigment representation method provides adaptability and expressiveness for image enhancement, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on
pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color
transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method
dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a
high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed
pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving
superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves
transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then
reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of
the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB
colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and
reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively
estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including
image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low

### [99] [GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02781)
*Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GCVAMD, a novel causal analysis model for Age-Related Macular Degeneration that uses modified CausalVAE to extract latent causal factors from OCT images, enabling causal inference and intervention analysis for AMD risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for AMD detection focus only on prediction performance without considering underlying causal mechanisms, which limits intervention analysis and reliability. There's a need for models that can understand AMD pathologies and causal relationships.

Method: The paper proposes GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach to extract latent causal factors from raw OCT images. This enables causal inference for AMD risk factors like drusen and neovascularization.

Result: GCVAMD successfully identifies drusen and neovascularization status with AMD causal mechanisms in latent spaces, and can be used for various tasks from AMD classification to intervention analysis.

Conclusion: The GCVAMD model provides a causal approach to AMD analysis that enables treatment simulation and intervention analysis while extracting informative latent features for downstream tasks, addressing limitations of previous prediction-focused methods.

Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes
of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as
anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the
degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision
loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD
or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to
reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,
deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and
GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in
distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI
driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists
regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works
mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying
causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific
factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a
novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified
CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT
images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal
inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major
risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent
causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through
GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD
causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for
various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a data augmentation framework for extreme value forecasting using GANs and SMOTE with deep learning models like Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM, showing SMOTE-based strategies perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme value forecasting is challenging with applications from finance to climate change, and data augmentation with GANs has been popular for class imbalance problems but needs adaptation for extreme value contexts.

Method: A framework combining deep learning models (Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM) with data augmentation models (GANs and SMOTE) for multistep ahead prediction, using novel strategies based on relevance functions to incorporate data augmentation considering extreme values.

Result: SMOTE-based strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability and improved performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM excels in periodic, stable datasets while BD-LSTM performs better in chaotic or non-stationary sequences.

Conclusion: The study provides effective data augmentation strategies for extreme value forecasting, with SMOTE-based approaches showing the best performance and different deep learning models having complementary strengths for different data characteristics.

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenTSLM is a family of Time Series Language Models that integrate time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length through two architectures: SoftPrompt and Flamingo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations in handling time series data, which is crucial in medical applications for synthesizing clinical information into actionable insights.

Method: Two architectures: OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt (implicit modeling via learnable tokens) and OpenTSLM-Flamingo (explicit modeling via cross-attention). Benchmarked on three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT.

Result: OpenTSLM models outperform baselines significantly, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for text-only models. Even 1B-parameter models surpass GPT-4o. Flamingo maintains stable memory requirements while SoftPrompt grows exponentially.

Conclusion: OpenTSLM successfully enables time series reasoning in LLMs, with Flamingo architecture being more scalable and memory-efficient. The models demonstrate strong clinical reasoning capabilities and are released open-source.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer is a structure-aware rainfall reconstruction framework that uses radar reflectivity as a structural prior to better capture sharp transitions and localized extremes in rainfall fields, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial interpolation methods for rainfall reconstruction often over-smooth critical structures and fail to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes, which are essential for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis.

Method: RainSeer uses a physics-informed two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper that performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into ground-level rainfall through bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder that captures the semantic transformation of hydro-meteors via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism.

Result: RainSeer consistently improved over state-of-the-art baselines on two public datasets (RAIN-F and MeteoNet), reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields.

Conclusion: RainSeer successfully addresses the challenges of translating high-resolution volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations and bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation, providing more accurate rainfall reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models are lightweight parametric policies trained with RL to dynamically issue natural language steering instructions to black-box foundation models, outperforming static prompt optimization by adapting to different inputs, users, and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. Static prompt optimization produces fixed prompts that fail to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments.

Method: Train lightweight parametric policies with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a small model that sits between input and model, shaping behavior on per-instance basis using environmental reward signals.

Result: Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization. They discover environment dynamics, improve downstream task performance, generalize across black-box models, and achieve specialization while maintaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as parametric, environment-specific memory. Dynamic optimization via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A market-based data selection method that prices training examples using prediction markets, with automatic signal aggregation, explicit token budget handling, and diversity mechanisms for improved coverage and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting useful training subsets combine heterogeneous utility signals (uncertainty, rarity, diversity) with ad hoc weights, lacking systematic aggregation and budget-aware selection.

Method: Cost-function prediction market (LMSR) pricing examples, single liquidity parameter controlling concentration, topic-wise normalization, explicit token budget handling via price-per-token rule, lightweight diversity head for coverage.

Result: On GSM8K with 60k-token budget: achieves parity with strong baselines while reducing seed variance and <0.1 GPU-hr overhead. On AGNews at 5-25% kept: competitive accuracy with improved balance and stability.

Conclusion: The framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed compute constraints for both prompt-level reasoning and classification tasks.

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training quantization can cause severe performance drops (10-65% accuracy loss) in worst-case scenarios, with safety-critical implications for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate potential catastrophic failures in PTQ and understand what input distribution characteristics cause severe performance degradation, especially for safety-critical applications.

Method: Formulated knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn network and bit-width policy pairs, analyzing worst-case failure scenarios through systematic experimentation.

Result: Confirmed existence of "detrimental" network-policy pairs causing 10-65% accuracy drops, compared to "robust" pairs with <2% decrease. Identified vulnerability points in PTQ systems.

Conclusion: PTQ requires caution in real-world deployment due to potential catastrophic failures. Emphasizes need for rigorous robustness examinations and safety considerations in deep learning.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: SAGE is a streaming data-subset selection method that uses Frequent Directions sketching to maintain gradient geometry in constant memory, prioritizing examples with gradient alignment to consensus directions for efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and energy intensive, requiring more efficient methods that reduce memory and compute requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Method: SAGE maintains a compact Frequent Directions sketch of gradient geometry in O(ℓD) memory, prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align with a consensus direction, and uses a two-pass GPU-friendly pipeline that eliminates N×N pairwise similarities and explicit N×ℓ gradient stores.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces end-to-end compute and peak memory.

Conclusion: SAGE offers a practical, constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for efficient training, providing deterministic approximation guarantees for preserving gradient energy within the principal sketched subspace.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uncertainty-guided ensemble selection using TabPFN's inter-quantile range (IQR) improves siRNA knockdown efficacy prediction without requiring ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learners like TabPFN show promise for biomolecule efficacy prediction but are sensitive to context selection. Current approaches lack methods to select optimal ensemble models without access to ground truth labels.

Method: Used TabPFN with sequence-based features and proposed an uncertainty-guided ensemble strategy that selects models with lowest mean inter-quantile range (IQR) for ensembling.

Result: TabPFN outperformed specialized state-of-the-art predictors on siRNA knockdown efficacy task. Model's IQR showed negative correlation with true prediction error. Uncertainty-guided ensemble achieved superior performance compared to naive ensembling or single models.

Conclusion: Model uncertainty serves as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions through ensemble selection.

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF) is a contrastive learning method that discovers independently controllable latent variables from high-dimensional observations, enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning without requiring pre-specified factored representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing factored MDP algorithms require known factored representations, which breaks down with high-dimensional observations, while deep RL cannot exploit factored structure. There's a need to automatically discover controllable factors from raw observations.

Method: ACF uses contrastive learning to uncover independently controllable latent variables by leveraging sparsity - actions typically affect only subsets of variables while others evolve under environment dynamics, providing informative contrastive training data.

Result: ACF successfully recovers ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey benchmarks, consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Conclusion: ACF effectively bridges the gap between factored MDP methods and deep RL by automatically discovering controllable factors from high-dimensional inputs, enabling sample-efficient learning without requiring pre-specified factored representations.

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

*Shaifalee Saxena,Alan Williams,Rafael Fierro,Alexander Scheinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid controller combining DRL and bounded extremum seeking improves robustness for nonlinear time-varying systems, with DRL handling large parameter optimization and ES ensuring time-variation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL performance degrades with rapid system model changes, while bounded ES slows down with many parameters and gets stuck in local minima. Combining them addresses both limitations.

Method: Developed a hybrid controller that integrates DRL (for learning from historical data and fast control of many-parameter systems) with bounded ES (for handling time-varying systems with unknown control directions).

Result: The hybrid ES-DRL controller outperforms individual components, demonstrated through numerical studies of general time-varying systems and applied to automatic tuning of particle accelerator beam transport.

Conclusion: Combining DRL and bounded ES creates a synergistic controller that exceeds the sum of individual parts, providing both fast learning from data and robust adaptation to time variations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

TL;DR: SFT is equivalent to Inverse Q-Learning, learning both policy and implicit token-level rewards, which can be recovered and used to improve models via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional view of SFT as simple imitation learning and establish its equivalence with Inverse Reinforcement Learning to reveal its reward learning capabilities.

Method: Prove SFT objective is special case of Inverse Q-Learning, formulate baseline-relative reward function to recover dense token-level rewards, and develop Dense-Path REINFORCE for policy improvement.

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE consistently outperforms original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks using recovered dense rewards.

Conclusion: SFT should be reframed as powerful reward learning mechanism beyond policy imitation, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

*Jindan Li,Zhaoxian Wu,Gaowen Liu,Tayfun Gokmen,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a residual learning framework for analog in-memory computing that enables effective training with limited 4-bit memristive devices by sequentially learning on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate for low-precision weight update errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog in-memory computing accelerators require at least 8-bit conductance states for effective training, but many promising memristive devices like ReRAM only offer about 4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, which substantially degrades training accuracy.

Method: A residual learning framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate for residual errors from low-precision weight updates. The approach allows training with limited-state devices by distributing learning across multiple tiles.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows the optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and achieves linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective on-chip training with limited-state memristive devices while incurring only moderate hardware overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment of analog in-memory computing accelerators.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFMG is a novel graph generation framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed graphs into Riemannian manifolds and matches distributions along geodesic flows between embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and the global structure of graphs, focusing mainly on aligning spectrum or degree profiles.

Method: Uses spectral eigenmaps to embed input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds, defines geodesic flows between embeddings, and matches distributions along these flows to generate output graphs.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art performance on graphlet, degree, and spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks, achieves up to 30x speedup over diffusion-based models, and demonstrates ability to generalize to unseen graph scales.

Conclusion: SFMG provides a new approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow matching, offering advantages in capturing geometric structure, flexible generation, and scalability.

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

*Imran Thobani,Javier Sagastuy-Brena,Aran Nayebi,Jacob Prince,Rosa Cao,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) methodology for comparing artificial neural network models to brain responses, enabling bidirectional mapping between models and brain data while achieving both high predictivity and mechanistic specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is little consensus on correct methods for comparing model activations to brain responses in neuroscience, and existing approaches lack principled comparison frameworks.

Method: Developed the IATC methodology - the strictest set of functions needed to map neural responses between subjects, allowing bidirectional mapping between candidate models and brain data to assess how well models can masquerade as typical subjects.

Result: IATC resolves detailed neural mechanisms (like activation functions), enables accurate neural activity predictions, achieves high specificity in mechanism identification, separates response patterns from different brain areas, and provides evidence favoring topographical deep neural networks as visual system models.

Conclusion: IATC demonstrates no inherent tradeoff between neural engineering goals (high predictivity) and neuroscientific goals (mechanistic accuracy), enabling principled model-brain comparisons that improve upon previous approaches.

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

*Nidhi Soley,Vishal M Patel,Casey O Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttentiveGRUAE is an attention-based GRU autoencoder for temporal clustering and depression prediction from wearable sleep data, achieving superior performance in clustering and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that can jointly learn compact behavioral representations, predict depression outcomes, and identify behavioral subtypes from longitudinal wearable data for better clinical interpretability.

Method: Uses attention-based GRU autoencoder with three joint objectives: sequence reconstruction, depression classification, and GMM-based soft clustering of embeddings. Evaluated on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants.

Result: Achieved superior clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). External validation confirmed reproducibility (silhouette = 0.63, AUC = 0.61).

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE effectively identifies clinically interpretable behavioral subtypes and predicts depression risk from wearable data, with validated reproducibility and temporal attention providing meaningful clinical insights.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

TL;DR: HOD-GNN enhances GNN expressivity using high-order derivatives of node features, creating structure-aware embeddings processed by a second GNN, with theoretical alignment to WL hierarchy and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited expressivity of GNNs remains a fundamental challenge, and derivatives of GNNs have been unexplored as a means to enhance expressivity despite being studied in other contexts like oversquashing and explainability.

Method: Introduces High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN) that leverages high-order node derivatives of base MPNNs to generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings, processed by a second GNN in end-to-end trainable architecture with efficient message-passing algorithm.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows HOD-GNN's expressive power aligns with WL hierarchy, and evaluations on graph learning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Conclusion: High-order derivatives provide a natural and effective way to enhance GNN expressivity, with HOD-GNN showing promising theoretical properties and empirical performance while connecting to existing approaches like Subgraph GNNs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MINTO introduces a novel update rule that uses the minimum estimate between target and online networks to enable faster and more stable value function learning in deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Target networks provide stability but slow learning, while using online networks directly leads to instability. MINTO aims to combine the benefits of both approaches.

Method: MINTO computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, mitigating overestimation bias while maintaining stability.

Result: MINTO consistently improves performance across diverse benchmarks including online/offline RL and discrete/continuous action spaces, with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: MINTO provides a simple yet effective modification that enables faster and more stable value function learning, demonstrating broad applicability across various RL algorithms and domains.

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: ML-augmented physically-interpretable catchment models using Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP) achieve performance comparable to LSTM models while providing better physical understanding and interpretability across diverse hydrological regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML-based hydrologic modeling lacks translation into improved physical-conceptual understanding despite large-sample studies.

Method: CONUS-wide large-sample study using ML-augmented physically-interpretable catchment-scale models based on Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP) with varying complexity, evaluated using attribute masks (snow regime, forest cover, climate zone).

Result: MCP-based models achieve performance comparable to LSTM models; appropriate model complexity selection based on process dominance variation across hydrological regimes is crucial.

Conclusion: Theory-informed, physically grounded approach enables parsimonious and interpretable model architectures that encode information about spatially- and temporally-varying process dominance, laying foundation for future 'models of everywhere'.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-

TL;DR: MINERVA is a neural network-based feature selection method that uses mutual information estimation to capture higher-order feature interactions, outperforming traditional pair-wise dependence metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature filters fail when target depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual contributions, motivating a more sophisticated approach.

Method: Two-stage neural network approach: parameterize mutual information approximation with neural networks, use sparsity-inducing regularizers, and decouple representation learning from feature selection.

Result: Effectively captures complex feature-target relationships and higher-order dependencies that traditional methods miss, with strong performance on synthetic and real fraud datasets.

Conclusion: MINERVA provides an effective solution for feature selection in scenarios with complex feature interactions, offering exact solutions and better generalization.

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA accelerates AdaLoRA's convergence using a hypernetwork with attention mechanisms to dynamically generate SVD parameters, achieving faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaLoRA improves LoRA by using SVD and dynamic rank allocation but suffers from slow convergence and high computational overhead during training.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate SVD parameters (P, Λ, Q) instead of directly optimizing them, with pruning of singular values for dynamic rank allocation.

Result: Achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance across various datasets and models, with broad applicability validated on other LoRA-based approaches.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA effectively addresses AdaLoRA's convergence issues while maintaining performance, demonstrating the value of hypernetworks for accelerating parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for optimizing inspection vehicles in drive-by bridge monitoring using adversarial autoencoders and Kriging meta-models to enhance damage sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drive-by inspection methods are limited by vehicle properties that significantly influence damage detection performance, requiring optimization of the sensing platform.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders to reconstruct frequency-domain acceleration responses, optimizes vehicle mass and stiffness by minimizing Wasserstein distance between damage distributions, and employs Kriging meta-model for efficient optimization.

Result: Vehicles with frequency ratios of 0.3-0.7 relative to bridge's first natural frequency are most effective, while resonant vehicles perform poorly. Lighter vehicles need lower natural frequencies for optimal detection.

Conclusion: This is the first study to rigorously optimize the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and propose a purpose-built inspection vehicle, establishing optimal vehicle configurations for enhanced bridge damage detection.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

TL;DR: TutorBench is a dataset and benchmark for evaluating LLMs' tutoring skills, showing current models perform poorly (≤56%) and need significant improvement in adaptive explanations, feedback, and hint generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As students increasingly use LLMs as learning aids, there's a need to develop models that can effectively tutor by identifying student needs, being adaptive, providing personalized guidance, and being accurate.

Method: Created TutorBench dataset with 1,490 expert-curated samples from high-school/AP curricula covering three tutoring tasks: adaptive explanations, actionable feedback, and hint generation. Uses LLM-judge with sample-specific rubrics for automatic evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 16 frontier LLMs shows none achieve >56% score. Models fall short in full tutoring skills (all <60% pass rate on rubric criteria). Claude models excel in active learning support but lag in other areas.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have large room for improvement in tutoring capabilities. TutorBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to guide development of next-generation AI tutors.

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated

### [126] [Topological Invariance and Breakdown in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02670)
*Yongyi Yang,Tomaso Poggio,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Permutation-equivariant learning rules induce bi-Lipschitz mappings that constrain neuron topology. Small learning rates preserve topological structure, while large rates allow topological simplification, reducing model expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how learning dynamics affect the topological structure of neuron distributions during training, revealing qualitative differences between small and large learning rates.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving that permutation-equivariant learning rules (including SGD, Adam) create bi-Lipschitz mappings between neurons, constraining their topological distribution.

Result: Identified a topological critical point η*: below η*, training preserves all topological structure; above η*, learning allows topological simplification making neuron manifolds coarser and reducing expressivity.

Conclusion: Learning dynamics occur in two phases: smooth optimization under topological constraints, followed by learning through topological simplifications. This theory is architecture- and loss-function-independent, enabling universal topological analysis of deep learning.

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

*Zeyu Yang,Tianyi Zhang,Jianwen Xie,Chuan Li,Zhaozhuo Xu,Anshumali Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ECF8, a lossless FP8 compression framework that exploits exponent concentration in GenAI models, achieving up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration while maintaining perfect numerical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GenAI models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, low-precision computation becomes essential for efficient deployment. The authors argue that low-precision floating-point formats provide numerical stability and hardware efficiency without dequantization overhead.

Method: The authors identify an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights and prove it arises from α-stable distributions induced by SGD. They establish a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67 and design ECF8 - an exponent-concentrated FP8 format with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding.

Result: Experiments on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters show up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations (no deviation in model outputs).

Conclusion: Exponent concentration is established as a statistical law of trained models, opening a principled path for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper classifies neural operators into spatial and functional domain models, analyzes their learning mechanisms for physics-based dynamics, presents an explanation method with limitations, demonstrates SOTA performance with dual-space multi-scale models, and emphasizes the need for physics-incorporated frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide deeper understanding of neural operators' learning mechanisms for data-driven simulations of complex dynamics, particularly focusing on how they learn physical principles from data.

Method: Classifies neural operators into spatial domain models (learning on grids) and functional domain models (learning with function bases). Presents explanation methods for prediction processes and develops dual-space multi-scale models.

Result: Shows neural operators can learn hidden physical patterns from data. A simple dual-space multi-scale model achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, the explanation method is limited to specific situations.

Conclusion: Dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential for learning complex physics and require further investigation. There is an urgent need for generalizable explanation methods and principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into neural operators for better generalization and discovery of hidden physical phenomena.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MACMs combine multiplicative and additive components to enhance both interpretability and predictive performance, outperforming both CESR and GAMs while maintaining visualization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance in machine learning for high-stakes fields like healthcare, where GAMs sacrifice higher-order interactions for interpretability while CESR includes interactions but underperforms.

Method: Introduces Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs) that augment CESR with an additive component to disentangle interactive and independent feature coefficients, effectively expanding the hypothesis space while maintaining visualizable shape functions.

Result: Neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and state-of-the-art GAMs in predictive performance while preserving interpretability through visualizable shape functions.

Conclusion: MACMs successfully bridge the gap between interpretability and performance by combining multiplicative and additive components, offering improved predictive capabilities while maintaining the visualization benefits crucial for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: EvoSpeak integrates genetic programming with large language models to enhance heuristic evolution by improving efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability through warm-start populations, natural-language explanations, and cross-task knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in genetic programming where effective heuristics become overly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks in dynamic and large-scale optimization scenarios.

Method: Integrates GP with LLMs to learn from high-quality GP heuristics, extract knowledge, and use it to generate warm-start populations, translate GP trees into natural-language explanations, and enable knowledge transfer across related tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling show EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability.

Conclusion: By coupling GP's symbolic reasoning with LLMs' interpretative and generative strengths, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

*Gautham Govind Anil,Shaan Ul Haque,Nithish Kannen,Dheeraj Nagaraj,Sanjay Shakkottai,Karthikeyan Shanmugam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAFT and P-GRAFT methods for fine-tuning diffusion models using reward functions, showing they implicitly perform PPO with reshaped rewards and achieve better performance than policy gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective fine-tuning of diffusion models using reward functions for downstream applications, overcoming the intractability of marginal likelihoods required by traditional policy gradient methods.

Method: Unified RAFT variants as GRAFT, introduced P-GRAFT for intermediate noise level distribution shaping, and proposed inverse noise correction for flow models without explicit rewards.

Result: Applied to Stable Diffusion 2, the framework outperforms policy gradient methods on T2I benchmarks (8.81% relative improvement over base model) and improves FID for unconditional image generation at lower FLOPs/image.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide effective fine-tuning strategies for diffusion models through reward shaping and noise correction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

*Kai Fukazawa,Kunal Mundada,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAMAC is a risk-aware offline RL framework that combines expressive generative actors with distributional critics to handle multimodal scenarios while maintaining safety through CVaR optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between risk-averse offline RL (which is safe but conservative) and expressive policies (which are only used in risk-neutral settings), enabling safe yet high-performing policies in safety-critical domains.

Method: Introduces Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC) framework that couples expressive generative actors (diffusion and flow-matching) with distributional critics, using composite objective combining distributional risk and behavioral cloning loss.

Result: Achieves consistent gains in CVaR_0.1 (conditional value at risk) while maintaining strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks, demonstrating improved risk-sensitive performance.

Conclusion: RAMAC successfully bridges the gap between risk-averse safety and expressive policy learning, enabling safe multimodal policy optimization in offline RL settings.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Conclusion: TSLT-Net is an effective, scalable solution for real-time drone cybersecurity that is particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission-critical UAV systems.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,

spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

TL;DR: The paper discovers novel structure in hyperparameter loss surfaces and proposes a theory that enables new analytical tools for understanding hyperparameter optimization, including confidence intervals for best performance and determining effective hyperparameter dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameters greatly impact model capabilities but modern models are too large for extensive search. Researchers need tools to understand hyperparameter loss surfaces, but few such tools currently exist.

Method: Developed a novel technique based on random search to uncover the asymptotic regime of the loss surface. Discovered that as you approach the optimum, the loss surface becomes characterized by simple features like effective dimension and best possible loss. Found that best scores from random search follow a new distribution whose parameters define the loss surface features.

Result: The paper reveals that in the asymptotic regime, the loss surface has simple structure characterized by basic features. Derived a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence. Developed tools that enable new analyses including confidence intervals for best possible performance and determining effective hyperparameter dimensions.

Conclusion: The discovered structure and theory provide powerful new tools for understanding hyperparameter optimization, making these tools publicly available for researchers to analyze hyperparameter loss surfaces more effectively.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of

TL;DR: This paper proposes an accuracy law that estimates the performance upper bound for deep time series forecasting by discovering an exponential relationship between minimum forecasting error and window-wise series pattern complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address confusion in the research community about minor improvements on saturated benchmarks and establish a clear research objective by determining the fundamental performance limits of deep time series forecasting.

Method: Conducted rigorous statistical tests on over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, moving beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics to analyze window-wise properties that align with the sequence-to-sequence paradigm of deep models.

Result: Discovered a significant exponential relationship between minimum forecasting error and window-wise series pattern complexity, forming an accuracy law that can identify saturated tasks and guide training strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed accuracy law successfully identifies saturated benchmarks, derives effective training strategies for large time series models, and provides valuable insights for future research directions in deep time series forecasting.

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: The paper presents a biologically inspired generative model using multiplicative updates based on geometric Brownian motion, connecting exponential gradient descent from Dale's law with score-based generative modeling for log-normally distributed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent optimization is inconsistent with biological learning systems, motivating biologically inspired approaches. Dale's law (inhibitory/excitatory synapses don't swap roles) leads to exponential gradient descent and log-normal weight distributions.

Method: Leverages connection between geometric Brownian motion SDE and exponential gradient descent. Discretizes reverse-time SDE to get multiplicative update rule. Proposes multiplicative denoising score-matching formalism for log-normal data, enabling training of score-based models with multiplicative updates.

Result: Developed novel multiplicative update scheme for sample generation from log-normal density. Experimental results demonstrate generative capability on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets.

Conclusion: First biologically inspired generative model using multiplicative updates based on geometric Brownian motion, connecting neuroscience principles with machine learning optimization and generative modeling.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RAGC method with hybrid-collaborative augmentation and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness to address limitations in current contrastive attributed graph clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAGC methods focus only on node-level embedding augmentation, overlook edge-level augmentation and node-edge interactions, and treat all contrastive sample pairs equally without distinguishing hard/easy pairs, limiting discriminative capability.

Method: RAGC incorporates HCA for simultaneous node-level and edge-level embedding representations/augmentations, and CSADA strategy that adaptively identifies contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them using pseudo-label information and weight modulation function.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on six benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGC's effectiveness against state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RAGC with HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other, enhancing discriminability in representation learning for attributed graph clustering.

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Motivation: Standard LLM serving systems suffer from poor resource utilization and low parallelism under request bursts due to non-preemptive scheduling and reactive memory management, leading to poor responsiveness and steady generation.

Method: TokenFlow uses dynamic request prioritization based on token buffer occupancy and consumption rate, with proactive KV cache transfer between GPU and CPU memory, overlapping I/O with computation to minimize preemption overhead.

Result: Experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs show TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput while reducing P99 TTFT by up to 80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Conclusion: TokenFlow significantly enhances LLM serving performance for real-time streaming applications through its preemptive scheduling and proactive memory management approach.

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

### [141] [Curl Descent: Non-Gradient Learning Dynamics with Sign-Diverse Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02765)
*Hugo Ninou,Jonathan Kadmon,N. Alex Cayco-Gajic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Biological neural networks may use non-gradient "curl" learning dynamics instead of gradient descent, which can either stabilize learning or cause chaos depending on network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether biological neural networks use gradient-based learning strategies or fundamentally different non-gradient approaches, given the diversity of synaptic plasticity rules observed in experiments.

Method: Analyzed feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons with rule-flipped plasticity.

Result: Small curl terms preserve stability similar to gradient descent, while strong curl terms destabilize the solution manifold - sometimes causing chaotic dynamics that destroy performance, but in other cases speeding learning by escaping saddles through temporary loss ascent.

Conclusion: Specific network architectures can support robust learning via diverse non-gradient learning rules, challenging normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks.

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

*Shashank Agnihotri,Jonas Jakubassa,Priyam Dey,Sachin Goyal,Bernt Schiele,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether safety interventions like refusal training survive activation edits (model abliteration) in open-weight LLMs, using a controlled study across 20 systems with balanced harmful/harmless prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if common safety interventions remain effective when models are modified at inference time with activation edits, addressing a practical safety concern for open-weight LLMs.

Method: Used model abliteration (lightweight projection) to remove refusal-sensitive directions, evaluated across Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B and open baselines, with 100 prompts per system and multiple judges for response classification.

Result: The study provides checkpoint-level characterization of robust safety components under abliteration, quantifies judge selection impact on evaluations, and shows how models can identify refusal in their own outputs.

Conclusion: Develops a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments and identifies which data-centric safety components remain robust under activation edits.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

### [143] [Optimal Rates for Generalization of Gradient Descent for Deep ReLU Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02779)
*Yuanfan Li,Yunwen Lei,Zheng-Chu Guo,Yiming Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes optimal generalization rates for gradient descent with deep ReLU networks, achieving polynomial dependence on depth rather than exponential dependence seen in previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing results either yield suboptimal O(1/√n) rates or focus on networks with smooth activation functions that incur exponential dependence on network depth. The goal is to achieve minimax optimal rates comparable to kernel methods.

Method: The approach carefully trades off optimization and generalization errors under the assumption that data are NTK separable from margin γ. A key technical innovation is novel control of activation patterns near a reference model, enabling sharper Rademacher complexity bounds.

Result: The paper proves an excess risk rate of Õ(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²)), which aligns with the optimal SVM-type rate Õ(1/(nγ²)) up to depth-dependent factors, achieving only polynomial dependence on depth L.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that gradient descent with deep ReLU networks can achieve near-optimal generalization rates with polynomial dependence on network depth, overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

*Théo Dupuy,Binbin Xu,Stéphane Perrey,Jacky Montmain,Abdelhak Imoussaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) by replacing binary evaluation of prediction intervals with relevance-quantifying functions, resulting in tighter intervals while maintaining coverage validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCP methods focus only on binary validity (inside/outside) of prediction intervals during threshold updates, ignoring interval relevance. This leads to abrupt threshold changes and potentially wider intervals.

Method: Proposed replacing binary evaluation with broader class of functions that quantify prediction interval relevance using ground truth, preventing abrupt threshold changes.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets show the proposed functions produce tighter prediction intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.

Conclusion: Leveraging interval relevance through appropriate functions in threshold updates can improve OCP performance by generating narrower intervals without compromising coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

*Hemang Jain,Shailender Goyal,Divyansh Pandey,Karthik Vaidhyanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents CLEAR, a novel methodology for fine-grained energy measurement of transformer components during LLM inference, revealing that attention blocks consume disproportionately more energy per FLOP than other components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference dominates AI energy footprint but current sustainability studies only report coarse model-level metrics, lacking fine-grained measurement methods to understand component-level energy consumption.

Method: Proposed Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR) to overcome temporal mismatch between microsecond-scale component execution and millisecond-scale energy sensors, enabling precise component-level energy measurement.

Result: Evaluation of 15 models across four architecture types showed attention blocks consume significantly more energy per FLOP than other components, demonstrating FLOPs alone fail to capture true energy costs at component level.

Conclusion: Establishes detailed component-level energy baselines and provides insights for building energy-efficient transformer models through targeted component-level optimizations.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Group DRO method addresses both inter-group and intra-group distribution shifts, outperforming existing methods on new benchmarks with realistic minority group shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust learning methods like Group DRO are vulnerable to intra-group distribution shifts, especially in minority groups with limited samples, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed hierarchical extension of Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties, along with new benchmark settings simulating realistic minority group distribution shifts.

Result: Method demonstrates strong robustness under minority group distribution shifts where existing methods consistently fail, while achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Broadening the ambiguity set to capture both inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties is crucial for robust learning against spurious correlations.

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general template to adapt stochastic learning algorithms to work effectively in the random-order model, recovering improved regret bounds for various online learning problems and showing that learnability in random order is characterized by VC dimension rather than Littlestone dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random-order inputs can exhibit significant non-stationarity that hinders stochastic learning algorithms, while adversarial algorithms maintain guarantees but may be suboptimal. There's a need to bridge this gap and adapt stochastic algorithms to random-order settings.

Method: The authors propose a general template for adapting stochastic learning algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their regret guarantees.

Result: The method recovers improved regret bounds for prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with switching costs. It also proves that in random order, learnability is characterized by VC dimension rather than Littlestone dimension.

Conclusion: The proposed template successfully adapts stochastic algorithms to random-order settings, providing improved performance guarantees and revealing fundamental differences in learnability criteria compared to adversarial models.

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

TL;DR: FlexiQ is an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for computer vision models that dynamically adjusts low-bitwidth channel ratios in real-time to handle workload fluctuations while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware accelerators like NPUs and GPUs are costly and difficult to scale for real-time workload fluctuations, creating a need for efficient quantization methods that can adapt to varying computational demands.

Method: FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to feature channels with small value ranges, uses an efficient bit-lowering method to minimize quantization errors, and dynamically adjusts low-bitwidth channel ratios in real-time.

Result: FlexiQ achieves 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning, outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization techniques, and achieves efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs with minimal runtime overhead on NPUs and GPUs.

Conclusion: FlexiQ demonstrates hardware efficiency and performance benefits by enabling real-time adaptation to workload fluctuations while maintaining inference accuracy through adaptive mixed-precision quantization.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Hankel singular value analysis from control theory to dynamically reduce State Space Models during training, identifying and preserving only high-influence dimensions to accelerate optimization while maintaining expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational burden of SSMs while maintaining expressivity, by finding the right balance between model size and computational efficiency through dynamic model reduction during training.

Method: Leveraging Hankel singular value analysis and balanced truncation from control theory to identify and preserve only dimensions with high influence during SSM training, applicable to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs and extendable to selective models.

Result: In-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure that is lost by models trained directly at smaller dimensions.

Conclusion: SSMs that begin large and shrink during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher performance compared to models trained directly at smaller dimensions.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand VAR models' efficiency and fidelity by connecting them to denoising diffusion and isolating key design factors that contribute to their performance.

Method: Formalizes VAR as iterative refinement with three key design choices: refining in learned latent space, discrete classification prediction over code indices, and spatial frequency partitioning. Conducts controlled experiments to quantify each factor's contribution.

Result: Identifies three critical factors explaining VAR's efficiency and fidelity, and demonstrates the framework's extension to graph generation and weather forecasting while enabling practical interfaces to leverage diffusion tools.

Conclusion: The iterative-refinement framework provides a unified understanding of VAR models, explaining their performance through specific design choices and enabling practical integration with diffusion methods while maintaining few-step generation.

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SASL, an interpretable framework for personalized health prediction that combines sparse linear models with subject-specific interactions and selectively integrates LightGBM outputs for challenging cases, achieving comparable performance to black-box methods with greater transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art models for health outcome prediction sacrifice interpretability and fail to address significant inter-individual variability in lifelog data, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: SASL integrates ordinary least squares regression with subject-specific interactions, uses iterative backward feature elimination with nested F-tests for sparsity, employs regression-then-thresholding for ordinal targets, and selectively incorporates LightGBM outputs through confidence-based gating.

Result: On the CH-2025 dataset (450 daily observations from 10 subjects), the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance comparable to sophisticated black-box methods with significantly fewer parameters and greater transparency.

Conclusion: SASL provides an interpretable alternative to black-box methods for personalized health prediction, offering clear and actionable insights for clinicians while maintaining competitive predictive performance.

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

TL;DR: Karma is a knowledge-aware model with frequency-adaptive learning that combines deep learning with empirical battery degradation knowledge for accurate battery health prognostics and remaining useful life prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven models for battery health prognostics capture temporal features but lack knowledge guidance, leading to unreliable long-term predictions due to complex battery degradation behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, and capacity regeneration.

Method: Proposes Karma with signal decomposition to derive battery signals in different frequency bands, uses dual-stream deep learning architecture (one for long-term low-frequency trends, another for high-frequency dynamics), and integrates knowledge through particle filters that optimize parameters of a double exponential degradation function.

Result: Achieves average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over state-of-the-art algorithms on two mainstream datasets, demonstrating superior performance in battery health prediction.

Conclusion: Karma shows robustness, generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management across diverse applications through its knowledge-aware approach with frequency-adaptive learning.

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

### [154] [RoiRL: Efficient, Self-Supervised Reasoning with Offline Iterative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02892)
*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL is a lightweight offline reinforcement learning method that eliminates the need for ground-truth rewards and reference models, enabling faster and more efficient reasoning improvement in large language models compared to test-time RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning for LLMs requires ground-truth rewards, while test-time RL using majority-vote rewards is computationally expensive and requires heavy online RL with substantial computational costs.

Method: RoiRL uses offline iterative reinforcement learning with weighted log-likelihood objectives instead of maintaining a reference model, enabling stable training with lower memory and compute requirements.

Result: RoiRL trains 2.5x faster than TTRL and consistently outperforms it on reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating better performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: RoiRL establishes a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels, providing a more efficient alternative to test-time reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

### [155] [DMark: Order-Agnostic Watermarking for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02902)
*Linyu Wu,Linhao Zhong,Wenjie Qu,Yuexin Li,Yue Liu,Shengfang Zhai,Chunhua Shen,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark is the first watermarking framework designed for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) that addresses their non-sequential decoding by using predictive, bidirectional, and combined watermarking strategies to achieve high detection rates while maintaining text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods fail on diffusion LLMs because they rely on sequential left-to-right token generation, while dLLMs can finalize tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design of traditional watermarks.

Method: DMark introduces three strategies: predictive watermarking (using model-predicted tokens when context is unavailable), bidirectional watermarking (exploiting both forward and backward dependencies), and predictive-bidirectional watermarking (combining both approaches).

Result: DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate across multiple dLLMs, significantly outperforming naive adaptations of existing methods (49.6-71.2%), while maintaining text quality and showing robustness against text manipulations.

Conclusion: Effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models, and DMark establishes the first practical framework for watermarking diffusion LLMs with high detection performance and robustness.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

TL;DR: FeDABoost improves FL performance and fairness in non-IID settings through dynamic boosting and adaptive gradient aggregation, achieving better fairness than FedAvg and Ditto.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance and fairness issues in Federated Learning under non-IID data distributions by enhancing model aggregation and boosting underperforming clients.

Method: Proposes FeDABoost framework with dynamic boosting mechanism and adaptive gradient aggregation inspired by Multiclass AdaBoost, assigning higher weights to clients with lower error rates and adjusting focal loss for hard examples.

Result: Evaluation on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets shows FeDABoost achieves improved fairness and competitive performance compared to FedAvg and Ditto.

Conclusion: FeDABoost effectively enhances FL fairness and performance in non-IID settings through its novel aggregation and boosting strategies.

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

TL;DR: Cell-MNN is an end-to-end encoder-decoder model that learns interpretable gene interactions through a locally linearized ODE representation of cellular differentiation dynamics, achieving competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for cellular differentiation dynamics rely on computationally expensive preprocessing and multi-stage training, and fail to discover explicit gene interactions, limiting biological interpretability.

Method: Proposes Cell-MNN, an encoder-decoder architecture with a latent representation as a locally linearized ODE that governs cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. The model is fully end-to-end (except standard PCA preprocessing) and learns biologically consistent gene interactions.

Result: Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, and learns interpretable gene interactions validated against the TRRUST database.

Conclusion: Cell-MNN provides an efficient, scalable, and interpretable approach to modeling cellular differentiation dynamics by learning explicit gene interactions through a locally linearized ODE representation.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

*Juan Sebastian Rojas,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first formal theoretical treatment of continual reinforcement learning through risk-aware decision-making, proposing ergodic risk measures as a solution to incompatibility between classical risk measures and continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through risk-neutral decision-making, but real-world applications often require risk-aware approaches. The authors aim to extend continual RL beyond mean performance optimization to include various risk measures.

Method: The authors first show classical risk measure theory is incompatible with continual RL, then introduce a new class of ergodic risk measures specifically designed for continual learning settings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that ergodic risk measures provide an intuitive and theoretically sound framework for risk-aware continual learning, supported by empirical results from a case study.

Conclusion: Ergodic risk measures offer a viable theoretical foundation for risk-aware continual RL, addressing the limitations of classical risk measures in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical time series analysis faces challenges from data sparsity, noise, and variable recording lengths, requiring methods that handle these issues while providing explainability.

Method: Weight window predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability space, creating convex series-level scores with explicit evidence trails.

Result: Achieves competitive iEEG classification performance across four medical centers while providing greater transparency and explainability.

Conclusion: The method shows potential for reliable and explainable clinical variable-length time series classification, addressing key challenges in medical time series analysis.

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

*Akriti Sharma,Dogan Altan,Dusica Marijan,Arnbjørn Maressa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfer learning approach for vessel shaft power prediction using high-frequency data for initial training and fine-tuning with low-frequency noon reports, achieving significant error reduction across different vessel types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy optimization in maritime transportation is crucial for cost reduction and operational efficiency. Accurate shaft power prediction directly impacts fuel consumption, but obtaining high-quality sensor data is often infeasible and costly, making alternative data sources like noon reports necessary.

Method: Proposed transfer learning-based approach where a model is initially trained on high-frequency data from one vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily noon reports from other vessels. Tested on sister vessels (identical), similar vessel (slightly larger with different engine), and different vessel (distinct configurations).

Result: Mean absolute percentage error decreased by 10.6% for sister vessels, 3.6% for similar vessel, and 5.3% for different vessel compared to model trained solely on noon report data.

Conclusion: Transfer learning effectively improves shaft power prediction accuracy using limited noon report data, demonstrating practical value for maritime energy optimization across various vessel types.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

TL;DR: BrainIB++ is an interpretable graph neural network framework that uses information bottleneck principle to identify informative brain subgraphs for schizophrenia diagnosis from rs-fMRI data, achieving superior accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ML models require extensive feature engineering with manual bias, while deep learning lacks interpretability, limiting clinical applicability for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

Method: End-to-end graph neural network framework applying information bottleneck principle to identify data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during training for interpretation.

Result: Superior diagnostic accuracy across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets, with generalizability to unseen data. Identified subgraphs align with established clinical biomarkers in visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition networks.

Conclusion: BrainIB++ provides both high diagnostic performance and interpretable biomarkers, enhancing clinical relevance for real-world schizophrenia diagnosis applications.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

*Dong-Dong Wu,Jiacheng Cui,Wei Wang,Zhiqiang She,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMIS is a unified framework for training robust diffusion models from imprecise supervision, addressing noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels in conditional inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional diffusion models rely on large datasets with imprecise information in conditional inputs, causing condition mismatch and degraded generation quality.

Method: Derived from likelihood maximization, DMIS decomposes into generative and classification components: generative component models imprecise-label distributions, classification component uses diffusion classifier with optimized timestep sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments show DMIS consistently produces high-quality, class-discriminative samples across various imprecise supervision tasks including image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation.

Conclusion: DMIS is the first systematic study within diffusion models for handling imprecise supervision and demonstrates robust performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

TL;DR: A unified framework for unsupervised model evaluation using confidence and dispersity metrics, showing hybrid approaches outperform single metrics for both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing model generalization under distribution shift when labeled test data is unavailable, which is essential for real-world deployment.

Method: Systematically benchmark confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across various model architectures, datasets, and distribution shift types. Use nuclear norm of prediction matrix as a robust metric.

Result: Hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics in both evaluation settings. Nuclear norm provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance.

Conclusion: The findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model assessment in deployment scenarios, with hybrid metrics providing strong complementary signals for generalization.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: CHORD is a device-cloud collaboration framework that enables personalized on-device sequential recommendation through channel-wise mixed-precision quantization, eliminating the need for costly retraining while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying reranking models on mobile devices, including resource heterogeneity requiring model compression, and the trade-off between capturing personalized user interests and computational burden of local retraining.

Method: CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across devices and uses cloud-based auxiliary hypernetwork modules to identify user-specific critical parameters through multi-granularity sensitivity analysis (layer, filter, element levels), then applies channel-wise mixed-precision quantization with only 2 bits per channel for communication efficiency.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets with SASRec and Caser backbones demonstrate CHORD achieves accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity in on-device sequential recommendation.

Conclusion: CHORD successfully enables dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, providing personalized recommendations while minimizing communication overhead and eliminating retraining cycles.

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization requires hand-tuned hyperparameters that don't generalize well across different problem landscapes, limiting its sample efficiency and applicability.

Method: Leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale optimization trajectories from 12 BO variants, trained on millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes.

Result: Achieves robust zero-shot generalization on unseen benchmarks from 2D to 20D, matching or surpassing sample efficiency of leading global optimizers including BO.

Conclusion: ZeroShotOpt provides a reusable foundation for black-box optimization that eliminates manual tuning while maintaining competitive performance across diverse problem landscapes.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

TL;DR: A distributional framework for offline IRL that models uncertainty over reward functions and return distributions, capturing richer expert behavior structure through first-order stochastic dominance minimization and distortion risk measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IRL methods only recover deterministic reward estimates or match expected returns, missing the richer structure in expert behavior and uncertainty in reward functions.

Method: Jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full return distributions by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance violations and integrating distortion risk measures into policy learning.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks show expressive reward representations and state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively recovers both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies, making it suitable for behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation learning.

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

*Mingfeng Fan,Jiaqi Cheng,Yaoxin Wu,Yifeng Zhang,Yibin Yang,Guohua Wu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes UD3RL, a dual-decoder DRL framework for solving the Close-Enough TSP, which separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint determination, achieving superior performance and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited attention has been given to the Close-Enough TSP (CETSP) in DRL research due to the challenge of neighborhood-based visitation criteria, where nodes are considered visited when agents enter their compact neighborhoods.

Method: Formulates CETSP as an MDP with discretization, uses a unified dual-decoder DRL framework with separate node-decoder and loc-decoder, employs k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction for spatial reasoning, and customizes REINFORCE algorithm for training.

Result: UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across problem scales, spatial distributions, radius ranges, and robustness to dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed UD3RL framework effectively addresses CETSP challenges through its dual-decoder architecture and demonstrates superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First differentially private algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein barycenters are computed from sensitive datasets, requiring privacy protection through differential privacy.

Method: Developed novel algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under differential privacy constraints.

Result: High-quality private barycenters achieved on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale U.S. population datasets.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated the first practical differentially private approach for Wasserstein barycenter computation with good privacy-utility balance.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under
differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale
U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

*Junyi Yao,Parham Eftekhar,Gene Cheung,Xujin Chris Liu,Yao Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight transformer-like neural network for EEG-based epilepsy detection by unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm on balanced signed graphs, achieving comparable performance to deep learning methods with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an interpretable and parameter-efficient method for differentiating epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using EEG signals, leveraging the inherent anti-correlations in brain signals modeled as negative edges in signed graphs.

Method: Build transformer-like neural nets by unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on balanced signed graphs. Implement an ideal low-pass filter efficiently via Lanczos approximation on the mapped positive graph, with learned optimal cutoff frequency from data.

Result: The method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep learning schemes while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective and interpretable alternative to traditional deep learning methods for EEG-based epilepsy detection, with significantly reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

TL;DR: The paper adapts Score identity Distillation (SiD) to train few-step protein backbone generators, achieving 20x faster sampling while maintaining designability comparable to the teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based protein generation models are computationally expensive, requiring hundreds of iterative steps, which limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery.

Method: Adapted Score identity Distillation (SiD) with multistep generation and inference time noise modulation to train few-step protein backbone generators.

Result: Achieved more than 20-fold improvement in sampling speed while maintaining similar designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model.

Conclusion: The distilled few-step generators enable large-scale in silico protein design, bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning potentials struggle with uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection in atomistic simulations.

Method: Developed Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body message passing, introducing joint energy-force negative log-likelihood loss function. Systematically benchmarked multiple Bayesian approaches including deep ensembles, stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and laplace approximation.

Result: The approach yields superior accuracy compared to conventional NLL losses, facilitates efficient active learning using Bayesian active learning by disagreement, and outperforms random sampling and energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Bayesian MLPs achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Bayesian equivariant neural networks establish a powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic simulations at scale, enabling uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces calibration.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-learning forecasters often fail in robust asset allocation due to objective mismatch and error amplification, creating a need for better risk-aware allocation methods.

Method: Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT) uses path signatures for geometric representation of asset dynamics and signature-augmented attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases like lead-lag effects.

Result: SIT decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines on daily S&P 100 equity data, especially compared to predict-then-optimize models.

Conclusion: Portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

TL;DR: A novel chaining procedure for GNNs that iteratively refines graph alignment solutions, achieving 3x better accuracy than existing methods and uniquely solving regular graphs where other approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems like graph alignment, limiting their practical impact.

Method: Trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices from previous networks, creating a bootstrap effect during inference. Uses a powerful architecture operating on node pairs rather than individual nodes to capture global structural patterns.

Result: Achieves over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, uniquely solves regular graphs where all competing approaches fail, and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers when combined with traditional optimization as post-processing.

Conclusion: The chained GNN approach successfully bridges the performance gap between neural networks and traditional optimization methods for the graph alignment problem, demonstrating practical impact on this fundamental NP-hard task.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

*Ali Azizpour,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive node feature selection method for GNNs that identifies and removes unnecessary features during training using permutation-based feature importance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that make classical feature importance metrics inadequate. There's a need for model- and task-agnostic methods to measure feature contributions for interpretation, dimensionality reduction, and performance improvement.

Method: An intervention-based approach that determines relevant features during training by measuring changes in validation performance when feature values are permuted. The method tracks how feature relevance evolves as features are successively dropped.

Result: The approach demonstrates flexibility across different graph architectures and adaptability to challenging graph learning settings. It provides feature importance scores and monitors feature elimination effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of feature selection in graph neural networks by providing an adaptive, model-agnostic approach that can identify and remove unnecessary features while tracking their evolving relevance throughout training.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBet is a gradient-free layer selection method that uses Betti Numbers to analyze activation space topology for efficient on-device retraining without requiring labels or gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained neural networks on edge devices with limited compute and memory, avoiding the impracticality of full-model gradient-based retraining.

Method: Uses Betti Numbers to analyze topological features of activation spaces through forward passes alone, ranking layers by learning capacity without requiring labels or backpropagation.

Result: Achieves 5% higher classification accuracy than gradient-based baselines while reducing peak memory consumption by 40% across 16 model-dataset pairs.

Conclusion: AdaBet provides an effective gradient-free approach for layer selection that enables efficient on-device retraining with improved accuracy and reduced memory usage.

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient real-time dispatching to ensure service reliability, maximize resource utilization, and improve passenger satisfaction in urban metro systems.

Method: Uses Convolutional LSTM model that incorporates planned terminal headways and historical data to forecast spatiotemporal headway dynamics across stations, with flexible methodology to simulate dispatcher strategies.

Result: Demonstrates promising headway prediction accuracy on large-scale metro data, providing actionable insights for real-time decision-making without intensive simulations.

Conclusion: Provides rail operators with a computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction through proactive operational control.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

TL;DR: A pipeline using Language Models to generate natural language narratives for counterfactual explanations, enabling better interpretability of AI decisions for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are promising for AI interpretability but are often too technical for non-experts to understand, requiring more accessible explanations.

Method: Proposed a pipeline that leverages Language Models (both large and small) with knowledge distillation and refining mechanisms to compose narratives for counterfactual explanations.

Result: The pipeline enhances reasoning capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them perform comparably to larger models while maintaining robust reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach makes counterfactual explanations more suitable for real-world use cases by improving accessibility and interpretability for non-experts.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VGB is a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm that uses backtracking to improve robustness to verifier errors in language model generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoding techniques suffer from catastrophic failures due to error amplification from seemingly benign errors in learned verifiers.

Method: VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk on a tree of partial generations with probabilistic backtracking, guided by process verifier and base model probabilities.

Result: VGB outperforms baselines on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks across various metrics.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides provably better robustness to verifier errors and demonstrates the value of sophisticated decoding strategies that leverage theoretical insights from approximate counting and sampling literature.

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

*Yehuda Dar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper applies high-rate quantization theory to analyze mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression, focusing on approximation error analysis and the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors as a function of the number of experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide new theoretical insights into MoE models using classical high-rate quantization theory, particularly understanding how the number of experts affects model performance in regression tasks.

Method: Defines an MoE model with input-space segmentation and single-parameter constant predictors as experts. Uses high-rate quantization assumptions (large number of experts with small regions) to analyze approximation error for 1D and multidimensional inputs, and studies statistical learning properties of expert parameter estimation.

Result: Formulates test error and its minimizing segmentation for 1D inputs, provides an upper bound for test error in multidimensional cases, and analyzes the learning of expert parameters from training data, showing the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors.

Conclusion: The paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates how the number of experts in MoE models affects the fundamental tradeoff between approximation error (which decreases with more experts) and estimation error (which increases with more experts).

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new active learning acquisition function that estimates calibration errors to query samples with highest calibration error before using DNN uncertainty, addressing the problem of uncalibrated uncertainty in pool-based active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty-based acquisition functions in active learning are affected by uncalibrated uncertainty models, especially in deep neural networks, leading to suboptimal generalization and high calibration error on unseen data.

Method: Uses a kernel calibration error estimator under covariate shift to identify samples with highest calibration error for querying, then leverages DNN uncertainty. Theoretically shows this approach leads to bounded calibration error.

Result: Empirically outperforms other acquisition function baselines by achieving lower calibration and generalization errors across pool-based active learning settings.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration-aware acquisition function effectively addresses the issue of uncalibrated uncertainty in active learning, leading to improved model performance with bounded calibration error guarantees.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

*Foivos Alimisis,Rustem Islamov,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a principled theoretical explanation for why learning rate warm-up improves deep learning training, showing it achieves faster convergence than fixed step-sizes under generalized smoothness conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning rate warm-up is widely used in deep learning but lacks theoretical foundations. The authors aim to provide a principled explanation for why warm-up improves training performance.

Method: The authors use a generalization of (L₀, L₁)-smoothness condition that bounds local curvature as a linear function of loss sub-optimality. They prove convergence bounds for Gradient Descent with warm-up schedules under this assumption.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows warm-up achieves faster convergence than fixed step-sizes. Experiments on language and vision models validate the theoretical insights and practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Conclusion: Warm-up schedules provide provable convergence benefits under realistic smoothness conditions, explaining their empirical success in deep learning training.

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language

*Irene Tenison,Anna Murphy,Charles Beauville,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FTTE is a semi-asynchronous federated learning framework that uses sparse parameter updates and staleness-weighted aggregation to achieve faster convergence, lower memory usage, and reduced communication overhead compared to existing FL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning on resource-constrained edge devices faces challenges with limited memory, energy, and bandwidth, while traditional synchronous and asynchronous FL approaches suffer from straggler delays and slow convergence in heterogeneous networks.

Method: FTTE employs sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation mechanism that considers both the age and variance of client updates in a semi-asynchronous framework.

Result: FTTE achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction compared to synchronous FL (FedAVG), while maintaining comparable or higher accuracy than semi-asynchronous methods (FedBuff) even with up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers.

Conclusion: FTTE establishes itself as the first practical and scalable solution for real-world federated learning deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

### [185] [Q-Learning with Shift-Aware Upper Confidence Bound in Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03181)
*Ha Manh Bui,Felix Parker,Kimia Ghobadi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DQUCB is a shift-aware Q-learning algorithm that uses transition density functions to detect distribution shifts and improve uncertainty estimation, achieving better regret guarantees than standard QUCB in non-stationary RL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Q-learning UCB algorithms can exploit sub-optimal rewards after distribution shifts occur in non-stationary RL environments, leading to poor performance when transition functions change suddenly.

Method: Proposed Density-QUCB (DQUCB) uses transition density functions to detect distribution shifts and leverages likelihood to enhance uncertainty estimation in Q-learning UCB, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows DQUCB achieves better regret guarantees than QUCB. Empirical results demonstrate lower regret across RL tasks and real-world COVID-19 patient allocation using Deep-Q-learning.

Conclusion: DQUCB effectively handles non-stationary RL with distribution shifts through shift detection and improved uncertainty estimation, outperforming baseline methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

*Wanjia Zhao,Qinwei Ma,Jingzhe Shi,Shirley Wu,Jiaqi Han,Yijia Xiao,Si-Yuan Chen,Xiao Luo,Ludwig Schmidt,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM-Physics is a process-level evaluation framework for physics reasoning that uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent solution steps and provides fine-grained, interpretable scoring with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics benchmarks only evaluate final answers, failing to capture reasoning processes, while stepwise methods rely on unreliable heuristic scoring or restrictive linear assumptions.

Method: Represent solutions as DAGs of formulas encoding causal dependencies, use rule-based symbolic formula equivalence matching, and prove optimality of DAG representation and scoring policy.

Result: The framework is more aligned with human expert scoring, reveals persistent reasoning failures in state-of-the-art LLMs, and provides diagnostic insight through step-level scoring.

Conclusion: PRISM-Physics provides a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities through structural rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

### [187] [Superposition disentanglement of neural representations reveals hidden alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03186)
*André Longon,David Klindt,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Superposition in neural representations can interfere with alignment metrics, causing artificially low scores. Disentangling superposition through sparse autoencoders improves alignment measurements between models and brains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether superposition arrangements in neural representations negatively affect representational alignment metrics, potentially masking true similarity between different neural networks or brain representations.

Method: Developed theory on permutation metrics' dependence on superposition, trained sparse autoencoders to disentangle superposition in toy models, and tested linear regression alignment in DNN→DNN and DNN→brain mappings in visual domain.

Result: Alignment scores increased when base neurons were replaced with sparse overcomplete latent codes, both in toy models and real DNN/brain mappings, showing superposition disentanglement improves alignment measurement.

Conclusion: Superposition disentanglement is necessary for mapping metrics to accurately measure true representational alignment between neural codes, as superposition arrangements can artificially lower alignment scores.

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

*James Thomas,Johan Walhström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models using wearable sensors can estimate perceived exertion during bicep curls, with random forest achieving 85.9% accuracy within ±1 RPE unit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate RPE estimation can enhance resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention.

Method: Used machine learning models with data from wearable inertial and EMG sensors collected during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls (69 sets, 1000+ repetitions), extracting statistical features for training.

Result: Random forest classifier achieved highest performance: 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% ±1 RPE accuracy. EMG data provided slight improvement over inertial sensors alone. Eccentric repetition time was strongest predictor.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation but identifies challenges for improving model generalizability, including EMG data quality and placement sensitivity issues.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

### [189] [Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199)
*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Best-of-Majority (BoM), a new inference strategy that combines majority voting and Best-of-N approaches to achieve optimal scaling in Pass@k settings, with proven minimax optimality and experimental superiority on math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-shot selection strategies like majority voting and Best-of-N underperform on difficult tasks, and Pass@k evaluation settings reveal that neither approach exhibits desirable scaling with k and sampling budget N.

Method: Proposed Best-of-Majority (BoM) strategy that first restricts candidates to high-frequency responses in N samples, then selects top-k rewards, combining advantages of majority voting and Best-of-N approaches.

Result: Proved that with sampling budget N=Ω̃(C*), BoM achieves regret O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k)), established matching lower bound showing minimax optimality, and demonstrated experimental superiority over majority voting and BoN on math problems.

Conclusion: BoM is a minimax optimal inference strategy that outperforms existing approaches, maintains performance when increasing N, and provides the desirable scaling properties missing in majority voting and Best-of-N methods.

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

### [190] [To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03207)
*Yuda Song,Dhruv Rohatgi,Aarti Singh,J. Andrew Bagnell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL in partial observability, finding that latent dynamics stochasticity determines which approach works better, and that the optimal latent policy isn't always the best to distill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability makes RL challenging due to history-dependent policies. While privileged expert distillation (using latent state info during training) is computationally efficient, it has failure modes that need investigation.

Method: Uses a theoretical model called perturbed Block MDP and controlled experiments on simulated locomotion tasks to compare privileged expert distillation vs standard RL without privileged information.

Result: Found that (1) the trade-off depends on latent dynamics stochasticity, and (2) the optimal latent policy is not always the best one to distill for imitation learning.

Conclusion: Provides new guidelines for effectively using privileged information to advance policy learning efficiency in partially observable domains.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

### [191] [Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03222)
*Guanhua Huang,Tingqiang Xu,Mingze Wang,Qi Yi,Xue Gong,Siheng Li,Ruibin Xiong,Kejiao Li,Yuhao Jiang,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg) to address exploration collapse in RLVR by preserving valuable low-probability tokens called "reasoning sparks" through policy regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR suffers from training bottlenecks where performance plateaus due to policy entropy collapse, losing exploration. Previous methods maintain high entropy but risk amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training.

Method: Lp-Reg regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution that filters out noise tokens and amplifies reasoning sparks, using KL divergence to shield these valuable tokens from elimination.

Result: Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for ~1,000 steps where baseline methods collapse, achieving 60.17% average accuracy on five math benchmarks (2.66% improvement over prior methods).

Conclusion: Preserving reasoning sparks through targeted regularization enables sustained exploration and state-of-the-art performance in RLVR training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Motivation: To improve drone controller localization accuracy in multipath environments using TDoA-based algorithms.

Method: Proposed Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Least Squares Bancroft with Gauss-Newton (LS-BF-GN) algorithms for TDoA estimation in multipath channels, evaluated in WLAN Channel F and TRGR channel with averaging and time synchronization error analysis.

Result: ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms significantly outperform LS-BF in multipath channels, with further accuracy improvement through multiple estimation averaging.

Conclusion: The proposed ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms effectively enhance localization accuracy in multipath environments, with averaging providing additional improvement and time synchronization errors impacting performance.

Abstract: We study time difference of arrival (TDoA)-based algorithms for drone
controller localization and analyze TDoA estimation in multipath channels.
Building on TDoA estimation, we propose two algorithms to enhance localization
accuracy in multipath environments: the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and
the Least Squares Bancroft with Gauss-Newton (LS-BF-GN) algorithm. We evaluate
these proposed algorithms in two typical outdoor channels: Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) Channel F and the two-ray ground reflection (TRGR) channel. Our
simulation results demonstrate that the ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms
significantly outperform the LS-BF algorithm in multipath channels. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we propose averaging multiple tentative location
estimations. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of time synchronization
errors among sensors on localization performance through simulation.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes an anti-jamming OFDM framework with spreading-based modulation, ML detection methods, and adaptive two-phase communication for unknown jamming environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance OFDM system robustness against jamming attacks by developing adaptive communication strategies that can operate effectively in both known and unknown jamming scenarios.

Method: Develops anti-jamming modulation using spreading matrix, ML detection methods, two-phase adaptive framework (jamming-noncoherent and jamming-coherent phases), and parameter estimation for unknown jamming environments.

Result: Superior BER performance compared to existing OFDM frameworks across various communication and jamming scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates jamming attacks in OFDM systems through adaptive modulation and detection strategies, demonstrating strong performance in diverse jamming conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming
attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that
uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers,
enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver,
we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity
variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known
jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme
to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to
dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive
communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent
phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we
develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of
jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the
jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the
proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method.
Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed
anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks
across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper extends causal emergence theory to analyze multiscale causal structure, revealing systems can be top-heavy, bottom-heavy, or have complex emergent hierarchies, providing tools to quantify this complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multiscale structure emerges in complex systems and develop methods to analyze causal contributions across all scales rather than just single paths.

Method: Extend causal emergence theory (2.0) to analyze causal contributions across full multiscale structure, develop mathematical tools to quantify complexity, and provide taxonomy of emergent hierarchies.

Result: Systems can be classified as causally top-heavy, bottom-heavy, or having complex emergent hierarchies; provides specific notion of scale-freeness when causation is spread equally across scales.

Conclusion: The framework enables quantification of multiscale complexity and demonstrates ability to engineer not just emergence but its distribution across scales, offering more precise understanding of scale-freeness.

Abstract: One of the reasons complex systems are complex is because they have
multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue
that it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the
system's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the
level of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many
systems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small
subset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the
theory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions
across the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single
path that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be
classified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent
hierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific
notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the
scales of a system) than the standard network science terminology. More
broadly, we provide the mathematical tools to quantify this complexity and
provide diverse examples of the taxonomy of emergent hierarchies. Finally, we
demonstrate the ability to engineer not just degree of emergence in a system,
but how that emergence is distributed across the multiscale structure.

TL;DR: Proposes Segmented Analog Broadcast (SegAB) for federated learning in wireless networks with imperfect CSI, reducing transmission latency by partitioning model parameters and transmitting multiple segments simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce transmission latency in federated learning over wireless networks with imperfect channel state information by optimizing downlink broadcast design.

Method: Segmented analog broadcast scheme partitions global model parameters into segments for simultaneous transmission, with robust downlink beamforming optimization using epigraph representation and feasibility subproblems.

Result: Simulations show SegAB substantially outperforms conventional full-model per-parameter broadcast and other alternatives in standard classification tasks under typical wireless settings.

Conclusion: The proposed SegAB scheme effectively reduces transmission latency and improves FL training convergence rate in wireless networks with imperfect CSI through segmented parameter transmission and robust beamforming.

Abstract: We consider downlink broadcast design for federated learning (FL) in a
wireless network with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to
reduce transmission latency, we propose a segmented analog broadcast (SegAB)
scheme, where the parameter server, hosted by a multi-antenna base station,
partitions the global model parameter vector into segments and transmits
multiple parameters from these segments simultaneously over a common downlink
channel. We formulate the SegAB transmission and reception processes to
characterize FL training convergence, capturing the effects of downlink
beamforming and imperfect CSI. To maximize the FL training convergence rate, we
establish an upper bound on the expected model optimality gap and show that it
can be minimized separately over the training rounds in online optimization,
without requiring knowledge of the future channel states. We solve the
per-round problem to achieve robust downlink beamforming, by minimizing the
worst-case objective via an epigraph representation and a feasibility
subproblem that ensures monotone convergence. Simulation with standard
classification tasks under typical wireless network setting shows that the
proposed SegAB substantially outperforms conventional full-model per-parameter
broadcast and other alternatives.

*Yuxin Li,Guangyue Lu,Yinghui Ye,Zehui Xiong,Liqin Shi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pilot-based symbol timing offset (STO) estimation method for ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) that addresses synchronization challenges without requiring coordination from ambient RF sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization, but practical STO occurs due to propagation delay and receiver activation latency, leading to unreliable symbol recovery. Conventional correlation-based methods are infeasible due to the uncontrollable nature of ambient RF sources.

Method: Designs a specialized pilot sequence to induce sampling errors, proposes a pilot-based STO estimator using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework that exploits statistical variations in received pilot signal, and integrates STO compensation into an energy detector.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates BER performance degradation caused by STO.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses STO estimation challenges in AmBC systems without requiring coordination from ambient RF sources, enabling reliable symbol detection.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things
(AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity.
Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter
device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol
timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR
activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR.
Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source
renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in
AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol
detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio
frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to
induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a
pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot
signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and
evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the
proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates
the BER performance degradation caused by STO.

TL;DR: Event-based vision sensor enables rapid and stable phase retrieval by detecting intensity changes during defocus translation, outperforming conventional sensors especially in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve time-efficient and stable acquisition of intensity information for phase retrieval under coherent illumination, overcoming limitations of conventional image sensors.

Method: Translate an event-based vision sensor along the optical axis to record intensity changes as events, then use a transport of event equation (partial differential equation) to linearly relate defocus events to phase distribution.

Result: EVS demonstrates superior performance over conventional image sensors for rapid and stable detection of intensity information, enabling accurate phase retrieval particularly under low-lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Event-based vision sensors provide an effective solution for efficient and robust phase retrieval by leveraging their ability to detect logarithmic intensity changes with wide dynamic range.

Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase
retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision
sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel
level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS
along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by
defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial
differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which
presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase
distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more
advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably
detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate
phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error correcting codes enable robust computation with faulty components, but choosing appropriate codes is challenging due to conflicting requirements of rate, distance, and computational accessibility.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving that code families cannot achieve constant rate, growing distance, and short-depth CNOT gadgets simultaneously.

Result: Proved impossibility of simultaneously achieving constant rate, growing distance, and short-depth CNOT gadgets in fault-tolerant codes.

Conclusion: Good rate and distance in fault-tolerant codes necessarily require deep circuits, creating an undesirable trade-off for certain architectures and applications.

Abstract: Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata
Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty
circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code
is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of
the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the
fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures
robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we
could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings.
However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional
requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information
to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large
rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code
family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and
short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving
good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an
undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications.

Motivation: Previous work showed existence of one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers of size n/2+O(√kn), but the computational complexity of finding minimal sparsifiers was unknown.

Method: Uses reduction from the classical nearest codeword problem to prove NP-hardness.

Result: Proves that finding a one-sided 1/2-sparsifier of minimal size is NP-hard and establishes hardness of approximation bounds.

Conclusion: The computational problem of finding minimal one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers for linear codes is computationally intractable.

Abstract: The notion of code sparsification was introduced by Khanna, Putterman and
Sudan (arxiv.2311.00788), as an analogue to the the more established notion of
cut sparsification in graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, for $\alpha\in
(0,1)$ an (unweighted) one-sided $\alpha$-sparsifier for a linear code
$\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ such that
the weight of each codeword projected onto the coordinates in $S$ is preserved
up to an $\alpha$ fraction. Recently, Gharan and Sahami (arxiv.2502.02799) show
the existence of one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers of size $n/2+O(\sqrt{kn})$ for any
linear code, where $k$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we
consider the computational problem of finding a one-sided 1/2-sparsifier of
minimal size, and show that it is NP-hard, via a reduction from the classical
nearest codeword problem. We also show hardness of approximation results.
