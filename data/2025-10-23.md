<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation generates massive datasets that are crucial for addressing societal, economic, and environmental challenges, but high dimensionality poses issues like sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality that limit machine learning effectiveness.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive review of dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically focusing on feature extraction methods that preserve essential data properties while reducing complexity.

Result: The review serves as a handbook for leveraging dimensionality reduction across the remote sensing data value chain, identifying opportunities for under-explored DR algorithms.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for enhancing Earth observation tasks like data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction, with potential for future research on under-explored DR algorithms.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are stealthy neural fiducial markers that blend into environments while enabling 6-DoF location tracking for AR, robotics, and other applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fiducial markers are often too conspicuous and undesirable for aesthetic reasons, limiting their adoption in real-world applications.

Method: An encoder network applies subtle visual alterations to create stealthy markers, trained end-to-end with detection modules using deep steganography techniques.

Result: Ninja Codes provide reliable 6-DoF tracking under indoor lighting while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes offer a practical solution for scenarios where traditional markers are undesirable, enabling stealthy location tracking using standard printers and RGB cameras.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that uses multimodal LLMs with temporal history and scene metadata to answer perception, prediction, and planning questions, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust QA system for autonomous driving that can answer high-level questions about perception, prediction, and planning by leveraging multimodal language models with appropriate contextual grounding.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase-1 uses Qwen2.5-VL-32B with six-camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting with self-consistency ensemble. Phase-2 augments with nuScenes scene metadata and category-specific instructions for different task types.

Result: Achieved 67.37% overall accuracy, with Phase-1 reaching 66.85% using self-consistency (vs 62.61% baseline). Maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. Performance improvements demonstrated across all metrics.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding significantly enhance high-level driving QA capabilities with pretrained vision-language models, showing robustness even under challenging visual conditions.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a novel state-space architecture for longitudinal medical imaging that handles irregular time intervals between high-resolution images while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to fully exploit spatial and temporal cues in sequential radiological images captured at irregular intervals, often compromising by collapsing spatial information or using inefficient spatio-temporal models.

Method: Uses continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that integrates true time differences between exams into state transitions, complemented by multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: Superior performance in breast cancer risk prediction benchmark, improving validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to recurrent, transformer, and state-space models.

Conclusion: The model efficiently processes long and complex patient screening histories with linear complexity, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-centric alignment framework that disentangles motion features from pretrained video encoders and aligns them with text-to-video diffusion models to improve temporal coherence and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models often generate temporally incoherent and physically implausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex motions in natural videos.

Method: Learn a disentangled motion subspace from pretrained video encoders optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, then align diffusion model features to this subspace.

Result: Improves physical commonsense in state-of-the-art video diffusion models while preserving text adherence, validated on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, VBench-2.0 benchmarks and user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-centric alignment framework effectively enhances motion quality in text-to-video generation by leveraging disentangled motion features from optical flow prediction.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh is a new metric for evaluating detailed image descriptions that uses scene graphs to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, providing interpretable scores that better match human judgments than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation metrics (CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and are insensitive to errors in detailed descriptions, particularly in attribute and relation attachments. There's a need for metrics that can localize errors and handle compositional understanding in long image descriptions.

Method: PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLM judges, producing aggregate scores based on fine-grained errors. The authors also introduce DOCENT, a new benchmark dataset with artwork descriptions and expert human judgments.

Result: PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman ρ) with human judgments than alternatives, works across different image types, and serves as an effective reward function that outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. Foundation models struggle with full error-free coverage of complex scenes.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT provide better evaluation tools for detailed image description, revealing that current models have limitations in handling rich scene dynamics, establishing a challenging new benchmark for VLM progress.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR is a unified human pose representation learning pipeline that aligns embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in multi-modal alignment for human pose representations, but limited research on correlating different pose modalities (images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons) using contrastive learning paradigms.

Method: Proposed UniHPR pipeline with a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align multiple pose representations simultaneously from images, 2D and 3D human poses.

Result: Achieved MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW with cross-domain evaluation. Also achieved 2D/3D pose retrieval with 9.24mm MPJPE error on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: UniHPR successfully aligns multiple human pose representations and demonstrates strong performance in both pose estimation and retrieval tasks, showing the effectiveness of the unified representation approach.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard U-Net models struggle with irregular tumor shapes and ambiguous boundaries in brain tumor segmentation, and face computational challenges with high-resolution MRI data and class imbalance issues.

Method: Integration of attention mechanism into 3D U-Net to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions, combined with a tumor detection algorithm using digital image processing to address class imbalance.

Result: The model achieved outstanding performance on BraTS 2020 dataset with dice score of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, outperforming related studies.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves brain tumor segmentation performance and offers valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasound breast cancer imaging datasets for enhanced tumor segmentation while preserving patient privacy, achieving 96% accuracy with a modified U-Net model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women, requiring early detection. Medical data privacy challenges make it difficult to develop accurate AI models, and non-IID local datasets in federated learning can impact model accuracy for tumor boundary delineation.

Method: Applied Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer imaging datasets, incorporating a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms to enhance tumor segmentation accuracy.

Result: Achieved a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing tumor segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy.

Conclusion: FedProx shows potential as a promising approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Ego-CS dataset with synchronized first-person views from Counter-Strike 2 enables multi-agent decision-making research, and Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) improves teammate/opponent position prediction from individual perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports analysis relies on third-person views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning that reflects how human teams actually coordinate.

Method: Created X-Ego-CS dataset with 124 hours of synchronized first-person gameplay footage from 45 professional Counter-Strike 2 matches, and proposed Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to align teammates' visual streams for tactical awareness.

Result: CECL demonstrated effectiveness in teammate-opponent location prediction tasks, enhancing agents' ability to infer positions from single first-person views using state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL establish foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports, positioning gameplay as testbed for multi-agent modeling with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning networks applied to detect malaria from blood cell images, with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet achieving over 97% accuracy, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual malaria diagnosis through blood smear observation is prone to errors due to lack of expertise and human involvement. Computer-aided automatic diagnosis is needed for reliable detection.

Method: Applied six deep convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) to extract features from blood cell images and classify them as malaria infected or healthy cells.

Result: Residual Attention Network achieved 97.28% accuracy and XceptionNet achieved 97.55% accuracy on a publicly available malaria cell image dataset, surpassing other related methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods provide reliable automatic detection of malaria while minimizing manual involvement, encouraging their real-world application for malaria diagnosis.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal is a training-free method that uses adaptive KV cache pruning to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models by focusing attention on critical visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs are a major challenge, and existing solutions introduce extra computational costs. The authors observed that hallucinations are strongly associated with insufficient attention to visual tokens due to redundant tokens dispersing model focus.

Method: Proposed PruneHal - a training-free method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance model focus on critical visual information without requiring additional training or incurring extra inference costs.

Result: Evaluated on several hallucination benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the method's effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PruneHal is an effective, model-agnostic approach that can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs without extra computational overhead.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: Conventional reward functions focus on overall video quality but fail to address temporal consistency issues in image-to-video generation tasks.

Method: Developed VCD metric defined in frequency space of video frame features to capture temporal consistency, and integrated it into reward-based fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results show VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance metrics compared to previous methods across multiple I2V datasets.

Conclusion: VCD effectively addresses temporal consistency limitations in I2V generation through frequency-domain analysis and reward-based fine-tuning, providing improved video coherence without sacrificing other quality aspects.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive is a synthetic data generation framework that uses 3D-aware guidance maps and 3D assets to create multi-view photorealistic videos for enhancing autonomous driving perception tasks, particularly corner case detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving world models focus on generation quality metrics but overlook downstream perception task evaluation, which is crucial for autonomous driving performance. Current synthetic data training strategies require double the epochs compared to real-only baselines, making the benefits questionable.

Method: Dream4Drive decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto these maps, and fine-tunes a driving world model to produce edited multi-view photorealistic videos for training perception models.

Result: The framework enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. It also includes DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Dream4Drive effectively boosts downstream perception model performance under various training epochs, demonstrating clear benefits of synthetic data for autonomous driving perception tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-GS is a unified framework that integrates multiple specialized experts via a Volume-aware Pixel Router for dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering quality while addressing efficiency through pruning and distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, with no single approach effectively handling all dynamic challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS) with a Volume-aware Pixel Router that adaptively blends expert outputs using differentiable weight splatting. Also includes efficiency improvements through single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and distillation to transfer MoE performance to individual experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting, achieving superior performance while maintaining efficiency through complementary optimization strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [17] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion is a camera-4D imaging radar fusion network for 3D object detection that uses surface fitting to enhance spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, addressing radar point sparsity and improving depth prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D imaging radar offers advantages for autonomous driving but suffers from sparse point clouds and low resolution, limiting geometric representation and hindering multi-modal fusion with cameras.

Method: The network estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data to create an explicit surface fitting model. This generates dense pseudo-point clouds to mitigate radar sparsity and guides image feature transformation from perspective view to bird's-eye view for fusion. Uses three branches: image branch, surface pseudo-point branch, and radar branch, all transformed to BEV space.

Result: SFGFusion achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks, effectively fusing camera and 4D radar features.

Conclusion: The surface fitting approach successfully enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling reliable dense depth prediction and addressing radar point sparsity for improved 3D object detection.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space objects in GEO are difficult to detect due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference in optical imaging.

Method: Uses wavelet transform to enhance high-frequency features and suppress background noise at single-frame level, then applies multi-frame temporal trajectory completion with Hungarian algorithm for cross-frame matching, plus post-processing steps including temporal matching, interpolation, noise filtering, and trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 90.14% on the public SpotGEO dataset, demonstrating effective detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GEO object detection challenges through wavelet-based feature enhancement and multi-frame trajectory optimization, showing strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead is a collaborative perception framework that learns to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features, overcoming bandwidth constraints by progressively pruning background cues during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth constraints make transmitting entire feature maps impractical in collaborative perception, and existing foreground-centric methods discard essential background context that provides crucial environmental information.

Method: Uses a curricular learning strategy that initially leverages background cues but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background data.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings.

Conclusion: Context-enriched foreground sharing through FadeLead effectively enhances collaborative perception while respecting bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unique perspective on 4D representations rather than exhaustive enumeration, helping readers select appropriate representations for their tasks in this fast-evolving subfield.

Method: Selective approach focusing on representative works to highlight desirable properties and challenges of each 4D representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios.

Result: Comprehensive coverage of popular representations (NeRFs, 3DGS) and under-explored ones (structured models, long-range motions), with analysis of LLMs/VFMs in 4D applications and current dataset landscape.

Conclusion: The survey aims to guide readers in selecting and customizing appropriate 4D representations for their tasks, while highlighting current limitations and future directions in the field.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

TL;DR: Proposes a novel super-resolution framework using ControlNet for semantic edge guidance to enhance one-step diffusion models, improving structural accuracy while maintaining fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between perceptual quality and computational cost in real-world image super-resolution, particularly the structural inaccuracies caused by distillation artifacts in one-step diffusion models.

Method: Enhances one-step diffusion model with ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance, and uses hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and edge-aware AME loss for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision.

Result: Effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining one-step generation efficiency, achieving superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models for super-resolution through semantic edge guidance, offering improved quality-speed trade-off.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

TL;DR: Proposes MobiAct, a lightweight MAV action recognition framework using MobileNetV4 backbone with knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost for resource-limited micro air vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV motion recognition approaches use large, computationally intensive models unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, creating a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.

Method: Uses MobileNetV4 as backbone with Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) from ResNet18 teacher network, parameter-free attention mechanism, and hybrid loss training strategy.

Result: Achieves 92.12% average accuracy across three datasets while consuming only 136.16 pJ energy and processing 8.84 actions per second, with 2x faster decoding than leading methods.

Conclusion: MobiAct enables low-energy, low-computation MAV action recognition with superior efficiency while maintaining highly comparable accuracy to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: D2D framework transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics to improve object counting in text-to-image generation, achieving significant accuracy gains without major quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for improving numeracy in T2I diffusion models are limited to differentiable regression-based counting networks, excluding superior detector-based models that use count-via-enumeration (non-differentiable).

Method: Proposes Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D) framework with custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which guide noise prior optimization during inference with pre-trained T2I models.

Result: Consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy across SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD models on four benchmarks, with up to 13.7% boost on D2D-Small benchmark, minimal image quality degradation, and low computational overhead.

Conclusion: D2D successfully bridges the gap between non-differentiable detection models and T2I generation, enabling superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation while maintaining efficiency and image quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Motivation: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are impractical for resource-constrained environments, creating a need for efficient training methods to develop powerful but lightweight alternatives.

Method: RIL combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning, using an LLM-based discriminator to distinguish student-teacher outputs and guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs for diverse learning.

Result: RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs, and in several instances surpasses them on diverse vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified reinforcement and imitation learning strategy enables student models to achieve significant performance gains, making lightweight VLMs competitive with leading closed-source models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

TL;DR: TS-GATR is a novel dynamic signature verification method that combines Graph Attention Networks and GRUs to model spatial-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower Equal Error Rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten signature verification is crucial for identity authentication but faces challenges due to intra-user variability and forgery risks, requiring more accurate verification methods.

Method: TS-GATR represents signatures as graphs with dynamic features, uses Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) with k-step and k-nearest neighbor graphs for spatial modeling, and integrates GRU for temporal dependencies.

Result: Experiments on MSDS and DeepSignDB datasets show TS-GATR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with consistently lower Equal Error Rates across various scenarios.

Conclusion: TS-GATR effectively addresses signature verification challenges by modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR

### [28] [Seabed-Net: A multi-task network for joint bathymetry estimation and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery in shallow waters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19329)
*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery, outperforming traditional methods and single-task approaches through cross-task feature integration and dynamic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat bathymetry estimation and seabed classification as isolated tasks, forfeiting mutual benefits and hindering adoption of deep learning methods for shallow-water mapping.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoders for bathymetry and seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via Attention Feature Fusion and Swin-Transformer fusion blocks, and employs dynamic task uncertainty weighting.

Result: Achieves up to 75% lower RMSE than traditional methods, reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30% vs state-of-the-art baselines, and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8%. Shows enhanced spatial consistency and sharper habitat boundaries.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling depth with substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

*Juncheng Wang,Lei Shang,Ziqi Liu,Wang Lu,Xixu Hu,Zhe Hu,Jindong Wang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates scale shift in crowd localization domain generalization, proposes a benchmark and new algorithm, and provides theoretical analysis to address performance degradation from head scale distribution discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd localization approaches suffer from performance degradation due to scale shift (discrepancies in head scale distributions) between training and testing data in domain generalization scenarios.

Method: Established ScaleBench benchmark, reproduced 20 DG algorithms, conducted systematic scale shift analysis, proposed Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) algorithm, and provided theoretical analysis.

Result: Demonstrated limitations of existing algorithms, quantified scale shift influence, and showed effectiveness of proposed Catto algorithm in mitigating scale shift effects.

Conclusion: Scale shift is a critical and under-explored challenge in crowd localization domain generalization, requiring specialized approaches like the proposed Catto algorithm and establishing Scale Shift Domain Generalization as an important research direction.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP is a parameter-efficient fMRI-to-image decoding method that aligns brain activity from different visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, eliminating the need for VAE pipelines while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI decoding methods overlook rich object information in CLIP's intermediate layers and contradict the brain's functional hierarchy by relying on parameter-intensive VAE pipelines.

Method: Multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, aligning fMRI signals from distinct visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, with Cross-Reconstruction strategy and multi-granularity loss.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance, especially on high-level semantic metrics, matching or surpassing SOTA methods while reducing parameters by 71.7% compared to VAE-based approaches.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP effectively captures visual details missed by CLIP-only approaches and strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring separate VAE pipelines.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition using EfficientNetB0 for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP for recognition via vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a training-free framework that can segment and recognize objects in images without requiring labeled training data, supporting open-vocabulary recognition.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Unsupervised segmentation using EfficientNetB0 features decomposed via SVD and clustered hierarchically, 2) Segment recognition using CLIP's vision-language alignment with SVD projection for cross-modal matching.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC benchmarks in Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, flexible, and generalizable for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition without requiring training.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: DaMo is a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures for multitask learning in Mobile Phone Agents, achieving significant performance improvements on mobile phone benchmarks and showing strong generalization across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously, and existing multitask supervised fine-tuning approaches cannot determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance.

Method: Proposed DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. Also introduced PhoneAgentBench, a specialized benchmark with 1235 QA pairs for multimodal mobile phone tasks.

Result: DaMo achieved 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods, and showed superior generalization across established benchmarks (2.57% average improvement). When used solely for MLLM optimization on BFCL-v3, it improved metrics by 12.47% over other methods.

Conclusion: DaMo effectively addresses the challenge of determining optimal data mixtures for multitask learning in mobile phone agents, demonstrating strong predictive capability, scalability across model architectures, and significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: DARE is a deformable medical image registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization using gradient norm of deformation field, integrates strain and shear energy terms, and includes folding-prevention mechanism for physically realistic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based registration methods often overlook regularization's critical role in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility, leading to non-physical artifacts like folding.

Method: Proposes DARE framework with dynamic elastic regularization adjustment based on deformation field gradient norm, integrates strain and shear energy terms with adaptive modulation, and includes folding-prevention mechanism using negative deformation Jacobian penalty.

Result: The approach mitigates non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: DARE provides a robust registration framework that balances stability and flexibility while ensuring physically realistic transformations through adaptive regularization and folding prevention.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF is a framework that protects Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) intellectual property by injecting adversarial perturbations while preserving rendering quality through learnable sensitivity fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting NeRF intellectual property from unauthorized use is crucial as they become powerful 3D scene representation tools, but existing methods avoid geometric perturbations due to quality degradation.

Method: Proposes AegisRF with two components: Perturbation Field that injects adversarial perturbations into pre-rendering outputs, and Sensitivity Field that learns spatially varying sensitivity to constrain geometric perturbations while maintaining quality.

Result: AegisRF demonstrates generalized applicability across diverse downstream tasks and modalities including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully protects NeRF IP by disrupting unauthorized applications through adaptive geometric perturbations without compromising rendering quality.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning in vision-language models for robotic manipulation, showing current VLMs perform significantly below human levels despite strong single-view capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations focus on single-view settings, while multi-camera setups are becoming standard in robotics to handle occlusion and depth ambiguity. There's a need to assess whether VLMs can effectively leverage multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning.

Method: Created MV-RoboBench with 1.7k manually curated QA items across 8 subtasks in two categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. Evaluated diverse VLMs including open-source, closed-source, and CoT-enhanced versions.

Result: State-of-the-art models remain far below human performance. Found positive correlation between spatial intelligence and robotic task execution in multi-view scenarios, and that strong single-view spatial understanding doesn't reliably translate to robotic spatial tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs face substantial challenges in multi-view robotic perception. MV-RoboBench is released as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs with standardized evaluation protocol.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for tracking warehouse workers using 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras, with improved alignment based on foot positions to reduce distortion effects, achieving over 20% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve warehouse operation efficiency through digital twins, requiring accurate worker position tracking in large spaces where single cameras have limited field of view.

Method: Used 19 wide-angle cameras on ceiling looking down, performed alignment based on floor surface, and aligned detected positions based on foot positions to reduce distortion from wide-angle lenses.

Result: Confirmed over 20% improvement in tracking accuracy and validated effectiveness of proposed approach through comparison of multiple appearance feature utilization methods.

Conclusion: The foot position-based alignment method effectively addresses wide-angle camera distortion and enables accurate multi-camera worker tracking for warehouse digital twin applications.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: PICK is a multi-step framework using MLLMs for psychological analysis of House-Tree-Person drawings through hierarchical decomposition, knowledge injection, and feature extraction to generate expert-level assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at objective multimodal tasks but lack application in subjective, emotionally nuanced domains like psychological analysis, particularly for clinical assessments like the HTP test.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of drawings into single-object, multi-object, and whole levels; targeted analysis with visual cues; HTP knowledge base with reinforcement learning-trained feature extraction; integration of multi-faceted information.

Result: PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' capability in psychological analysis and is validated as a general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The framework bridges MLLMs with specialized expert domains, providing structured and interpretable analysis of human mental states through visual expression.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IC-Defect-14 dataset and ReCAME-Net model to address challenges in real-world IC defect classification with highly imbalanced data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces challenges due to extreme data imbalance from high yield-rate requirements and complex feature mixing of class-specific and domain-related attributes, which existing models fail to handle effectively.

Method: Proposes ReCAME-Net with multi-expert classifier framework integrating regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, hard category mining strategy, and knowledge distillation procedure.

Result: ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining competitive performance on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of real-world IC defect classification with highly imbalanced data and complex intra-class diversity/inter-class similarity characteristics.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN framework generates representative pore-scale images with controlled porosity and depth parameters, addressing spatial heterogeneity and data scarcity in subsurface characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate from core-measured values, compounded by data scarcity where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.

Method: Multi-conditional GAN trained on thin section samples from carbonate formation, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a unified model.

Result: Achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197, preserving critical pore network characteristics with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% vs 36.4-578% for real sub-images.

Conclusion: Provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management where representative pore morphology is critical for digital rock physics.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput, creating a need for faster scanning methods while maintaining image quality.

Method: Uses generative models conditioned on diverse data sources (other contrast images, previous scans, acquisition parameters, patient info) to predict target contrast images, which then serve as informative priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled MRI data.

Result: Evaluated on 14,921 scans (1,051,904 slices) across multiple datasets, the method significantly outperformed other approaches at high acceleration factors (4x, 8x, 12x), particularly for FLAIR reconstruction from T1w/T2w scans and T1w reconstruction from previous T1w scans.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm of predictive imaging, enabling faster MRI acquisition without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

### [41] [PRGCN: A Graph Memory Network for Cross-Sequence Pattern Reuse in 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19475)
*Zhuoyang Xie,Yibo Zhao,Hui Huang,Riwei Wang,Zan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRGCN introduces cross-sequence pattern reuse for 3D human pose estimation, using a graph memory bank to store pose prototypes that provide structured priors, combined with a dual-stream architecture for robust spatiotemporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods process sequences in isolation, missing the opportunity to leverage repetitive motion patterns and structural regularities across different sequences in human movement.

Method: Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN) with graph memory bank storing pose prototypes, attention-based retrieval mechanism, memory-driven graph convolution with anatomical constraints, and dual-stream hybrid architecture combining Mamba-based state-space models with self-attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with MPJPE of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP, with enhanced cross-domain generalization capability.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal for advancing 3D human pose estimation, shifting from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

### [42] [Mitigating representation bias caused by missing pixels in methane plume detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19478)
*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses representation bias in methane plume detection from satellite images caused by systematically missing pixels (MNAR). The authors show that models can spuriously associate image coverage with labels, leading to under-detection in low-coverage images. They propose imputation and weighted resampling methods to remove this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite images often have missing pixels due to clouds and other factors, creating missing-not-at-random (MNAR) data. This can cause representation bias where models associate image coverage (percentage of valid pixels) with labels, leading to under-detection of methane plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: The authors evaluate multiple imputation approaches and propose a weighted resampling scheme during training that enforces class balance in each coverage bin to remove the association between label and coverage.

Result: Both resampling and imputation significantly reduce representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models show higher chance of detecting plumes in low-coverage images in operational scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing techniques effectively address representation bias caused by systematically missing pixels in satellite imagery, improving methane plume detection performance particularly in challenging low-coverage conditions.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

*Chen Li,Huiying Xu,Changxin Gao,Zeyu Wang,Yun Liu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cauvis method improves single-source domain generalization in object detection by addressing spurious correlations through causal visual prompts and dual-branch feature disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from spurious correlations where models rely on simplistic features like color instead of domain-invariant representations like object contours, due to domain shift and limited domain knowledge.

Method: Proposes Cauvis with Cross-Attention Prompts module to mitigate bias from spurious features, and a dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, and exhibits significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively addresses the critical challenge of spurious correlations in single-source domain generalized object detection through causal visual prompts and feature disentanglement.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Moshe Kimhi,Nimrod Shabtay,Raja Giryes,Chaim Baskin,Eli Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight module that predicts the minimal sufficient image resolution for VLMs, reducing compute by up to 80% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images in VLMs inflate visual tokens to 97-99% of total tokens, causing high compute and latency even when low-resolution images would suffice.

Method: Uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target VLM's response converges to its peak ability, trained as discrete classifier but interpolates continuous resolutions at inference.

Result: Across five multimodal benchmarks, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80% for diverse target VLMs.

Conclusion: CARES effectively reduces computational costs in VLMs by intelligently selecting minimal sufficient image resolutions without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter improves camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs by generating clearer intermediate frames using hybrid video generation and selecting optimal frames via feature matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap, and current approaches using video interpolation produce blurry frames with inefficient selection strategies.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) combining video interpolation with pose-conditioned novel view synthesis, and Feature Matching Selector (FMS) to select optimal intermediate frames for pose estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoseCrafter significantly enhances pose estimation performance on challenging cases with small or no overlap across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter effectively addresses the critical challenge of pairwise camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs through improved intermediate frame generation and selection.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual reasoning tasks like object counting due to sensitivity to object attributes and spatial arrangements. Fine-tuning just the output layer can improve counting accuracy by up to 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have limitations in visual reasoning tasks such as identifying relations, understanding temporal sequences, and counting objects, despite their competitive performance on downstream tasks.

Method: Study reasoning skills of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs in counting tasks under controlled conditions, perform layer-wise analysis, and conduct targeted training by fine-tuning only the output layer.

Result: VLMs are highly sensitive to object number, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Layer analysis shows errors occur in mapping last-layer representations to output. Fine-tuning output layer improves accuracy by up to 21% with consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted fine-tuning of the output layer significantly improves VLM performance on counting tasks, addressing core limitations in visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [47] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how prompt complexity affects synthetic data utility from text-to-image models, showing that increased complexity reduces diversity and consistency but improves distribution alignment with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how prompt complexity impacts the quality, diversity, and consistency of synthetic data from T2I models, as this relationship remains underexplored despite prompt engineering being the primary interaction method.

Method: Conducted synthetic experiments with theoretical derivations, introduced an evaluation framework to compare real and synthetic data utility, and performed large-scale empirical analysis across diverse datasets (CC12M, ImageNet-1k, DCI) with different inference-time intervention methods.

Result: Increasing prompt complexity leads to lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency but reduces synthetic-to-real distribution shift. Prompt expansion using pre-trained language models as likelihood estimators achieves the highest performance in image diversity and aesthetics, even surpassing real data.

Conclusion: Prompt complexity significantly influences synthetic data utility, with trade-offs between diversity/consistency and distribution alignment. Current interventions can enhance diversity but may move outside real data support, while prompt expansion emerges as the most effective method.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the temporal awareness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, introduces a benchmark dataset TIME10k with 10,000+ images, and proposes methods to extract explicit timeline representations from VLM embeddings for temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large-scale VLMs can position visual content in time and understand temporal information, given their generalizable multimodal representations and open-vocabulary capabilities.

Method: Created TIME10k benchmark dataset with temporal ground truth, evaluated 37 VLMs using novel methodology, discovered temporal information forms low-dimensional non-linear manifold in embedding space, and developed methods to extract explicit timeline representations.

Result: Temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional non-linear manifold in VLM embedding space. The proposed timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: VLMs possess temporal awareness that can be leveraged through explicit timeline representations extracted from their embedding space, enabling effective temporal reasoning tasks with high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAD is a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras to enhance object tracking in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB and event cameras have complementary strengths (texture details vs. temporal resolution/HDR), but their different imaging mechanisms create spatio-temporal asymmetries that hinder effective multi-modal integration for object tracking.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) with hierarchical alignment strategy to minimize information loss while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter compactness in the student network.

Result: Extensive experiments show HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: HAD successfully addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras, enabling improved multi-modal object tracking performance.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: Alpha-Cloak is the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors using the alpha channel of RGBA videos, achieving 100% attack success rate without model access or perceptible artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models are widely deployed in cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles, but video-domain adversarial attacks remain unexplored, especially in no-box settings where attackers have no model access.

Method: Exploits the alpha channel to fuse malicious target video with benign video, creating fused videos that appear normal to humans but fool object detectors. The attack requires no model architecture, parameters, or outputs access.

Result: Achieved 100% attack success rate across five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, with no perceptible artifacts and full compatibility across video formats.

Conclusion: Reveals a previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that account for alpha channel manipulation in adversarial settings.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

TL;DR: VGD is a feed-forward framework for surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction that uses geometric priors from VGGT and Gaussian parameters to improve novel view rendering quality while maintaining geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views in surround-view autonomous driving due to minimal overlap regions between views.

Method: Uses a lightweight VGGT variant for geometric estimation, a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters, and integrates multi-scale features from both branches to supervise semantic refinement through feature-consistent learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes dataset in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings.

Conclusion: VGD demonstrates scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

TL;DR: A multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that enables single-modality inference by structuring model manifolds into modality-shared and modality-specific information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse EO tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Earth Observation where access to same sensor modalities during training and inference is complex due to real-world constraints, requiring methods that can leverage multi-modal training data for single-modality deployment.

Method: Combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning to guide single-modality models to structure internal model manifolds into modality-shared and modality-specific information, enabling generalization across tasks without targeting specific inference modalities.

Result: Demonstrates consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, with only one modality available at inference time.

Conclusion: Validates the framework's effectiveness in single-modality inference scenarios across diverse Earth Observation applications, providing a generalized solution for multi-modal co-learning in EO domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Motivation: Address depth-of-field limitations in optical lenses where only objects within specific range appear sharp, and overcome challenges like limited training data, domain gaps from synthetic datasets, and difficulties with information-lacking regions.

Method: Uses distilled variational autoencoder for efficient image reconstruction, processes up to 7 images simultaneously in fusion module, and introduces MattingMFIF - a new synthetic 4K dataset simulating realistic DOF effects from real photographs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results, generates seamless artifact-free fused images, and bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Offers significant step forward in addressing complex multi-focus image fusion challenges, with code and weights made available.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from

module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks uncertainty estimation methods for semantic segmentation in satellite imagery, evaluating their practical utility for identifying prediction errors and noise-corrupted regions across two remote sensing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for scalable uncertainty estimation methods in semantic segmentation for satellite imagery, particularly for remote sensing applications where most research has focused on other domains like scene understanding or medical imaging.

Method: Extensive evaluation using Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles with various neural architectures and uncertainty metrics on two remote sensing datasets (PASTIS and ForTy) that differ in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence.

Result: The study provides practical recommendations based on findings about which uncertainty estimation methods work best for identifying prediction errors and noise-corrupted regions in satellite imagery segmentation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes benchmarks and practical guidelines for uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation specifically tailored for remote sensing and Earth observation applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

### [56] [Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592)
*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecAF is a training-free method that refines MLLM attention maps for video reasoning segmentation using contrastive object-background fusion and complementary video-frame fusion, achieving performance comparable to training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable training-free video reasoning segmentation by directly adapting MLLMs' video understanding capabilities for localization, addressing the limitations of noisy raw attention maps that are poorly aligned with object regions.

Method: Proposes Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF) with two mechanisms: contrastive object-background fusion to suppress irrelevant activations, and complementary video-frame fusion to enhance object-focused cues. Also introduces attention-guided SAM2 prompting for fine-grained masks without retraining MLLMs.

Result: DecAF outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables training-free video reasoning segmentation by refining MLLM attention maps, demonstrating competitive performance without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

### [57] [CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597)
*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Image Forgery Localization that generates multiple diverse localization maps to address uncertainty in tampered regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFL methods produce single deterministic localization maps that lack precision and reliability for high-stakes applications like forensic analysis and security surveillance.

Method: CBDiff uses a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model that incorporates Bernoulli noise to reflect binary/sparse properties of forgery masks and introduces Time-Step Cross-Attention for semantic feature guidance with temporal steps.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CBDiff demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment by providing more credible and comprehensive forgery localization through multiple plausible maps.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic benchmark evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across 7 CLIP-style VLM variants, revealing limitations in grounding ability for small/diffuse lesions despite strong recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show strong zero-shot medical image understanding, but their grounding ability (alignment between textual concepts and visual evidence) remains underexplored, which is essential for clinical interpretability and adoption.

Method: Generated visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, quantitatively assessed alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies in chest X-rays.

Result: (1) VLMs show reasonable localization for large/well-defined pathologies but degrade for small/diffuse lesions; (2) Chest X-ray-specific pretraining improves alignment; (3) Recognition ability and grounding ability are strongly correlated.

Conclusion: Current VLMs fall short in clinically reliable grounding despite strong recognition ability, highlighting need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before medical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [59] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a denoising estimator using wavelet scattering coefficients that achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images with piecewise C^α edges, bridging harmonic analysis and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse estimators in frames (wavelets, curvelets) are suboptimal for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz exponents α≤2, while deep neural networks perform better but lack theoretical understanding.

Method: Jointly minimize and maximize ℓ¹ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients, which are computed by applying a second wavelet transform to the modulus of wavelet coefficients.

Result: Numerical experiments show the estimator reaches minimax asymptotic bounds for all α≤2, capturing different types of geometric image regularity through ℓ¹ norms.

Conclusion: The approach provides a harmonic analysis method for noise suppression and geometric regularity specification, creating a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and deep convolutional networks.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm enables seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation without retraining, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameters when adding new agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent collaboration approaches fail in heterogeneous settings due to domain gaps from different sensors/models, intrusive retraining that disrupts semantic consistency, and high computational costs for scalability.

Method: Uses Generative Communication with Deformable Message Extractor to extract spatial messages, Spatial-Aware Feature Generator with conditional diffusion model to generate aligned features, and Channel Enhancer for refinement before fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

Conclusion: GenComm provides a practical solution for heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration that maintains semantic consistency while enabling efficient scalability through lightweight spatial alignment and feature generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR is a zero-external-dependency framework that addresses moment retrieval bottlenecks through data augmentation and two-stage training with cold-start curriculum learning and distillation adaptation, achieving improved performance without additional manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three critical bottlenecks in moment retrieval: data scarcity leading to shallow keyword associations, boundary ambiguity in transition regions, and insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics.

Method: Two-stage training framework: (1) Cold-start stage with curriculum learning on augmented data for boundary/semantic awareness, (2) Distillation stage with dual query sets (Original and Active Queries) and cross-stage distillation loss for consistency and generalization.

Result: AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AMR framework effectively resolves boundary ambiguity and semantic confusion without additional data, preserves discriminative capabilities, and enables real-world generalization through its two-stage training approach.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving world models are mostly used for simulation and decoupled from planning. The synergistic relationship between world modeling and planning needs further exploration.

Method: Proposes Policy World Model (PWM) with unified architecture, action-free future state forecasting, collaborative state-action prediction, dynamically enhanced parallel token generation, context-guided tokenizer, and adaptive dynamic focal loss.

Result: Despite using only front camera input, PWM matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that use multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: PWM demonstrates effective integration of world modeling and planning, achieving competitive performance with simpler input requirements.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

TL;DR: MedReason-R1 is a medical VLM that improves CT disease diagnosis by incorporating zoom-in disease regions and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs perform poorly in medical domain due to lack of specialized datasets and neglect of diagnostic process from coarse to fine-grained.

Method: Constructed CT-RATE-VQA dataset (84K QA pairs) and proposed MedReason-R1 with zoom-in disease ROI embedding and GRPO reinforcement learning framework.

Result: MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses medical VLM limitations and demonstrates superior diagnostic performance through explicit reasoning processes.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS addresses over-reconstruction artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing importance-aware densification and parameter perturbation mechanisms to reactivate frozen primitives in complex regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts like local blurring and needle-shape distortions, caused by gradient magnitude dilution and primitive frozen phenomenon where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited.

Method: ReAct-GS uses two key components: (1) importance-aware densification criterion incorporating α-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to reactivate stalled primitive growth, and (2) reactivation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. The method also improves other 3D-GS variants like Pixel-GS.

Conclusion: The reactivation mechanism successfully addresses fundamental limitations in 3D-GS and demonstrates broad applicability across different variants of Gaussian splatting methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

TL;DR: MLLMs exhibit human-like visual pop-out effects for color and size features, with capacity limits for conjunctive search, and incorporate natural scene priors like lighting direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying visual processing mechanisms in MLLMs, which are currently opaque despite strong task performance, by adapting cognitive psychology paradigms.

Method: Adapted classic visual search paradigms from human perception studies to test pop-out effects, using controlled experiments with color, size and lighting features, plus fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses.

Result: Advanced MLLMs show human-like pop-out effects in color/size-based disjunctive search, capacity limits for conjunctive search, and evidence of incorporating natural scene priors like lighting direction.

Conclusion: Visual search serves as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs, revealing human-like visual processing mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

TL;DR: CST is a framework for unpaired image-to-image translation that preserves fine curvilinear structures in medical imaging by integrating structure consistency through a curvilinear extraction module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image translation methods often distort fine curvilinear structures like microvasculature, which is critical in medical imaging where subtle morphological changes have clinical significance.

Method: CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods like CycleGAN and UNSB.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities shows CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance while preserving geometric integrity.

Conclusion: CST establishes a principled pathway for curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging by reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

TL;DR: Proposes Ensemble-CAM, a novel technique for providing visual explanations of deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems to improve transparency and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presentation attacks using fake biometric data pose security threats, and while DL-based PAD systems are effective, they function as black boxes with opaque decisions. Explainability techniques are needed to understand model behavior and identify key regions that influence decisions.

Method: Developed Ensemble-CAM, a technique for generating visual explanations of DL-based face PAD systems' decisions, helping identify which image regions contribute to classifying biometric images as real or fake.

Result: The proposed Ensemble-CAM technique successfully provides visual explanations that enhance understanding of DL-based face PAD system behavior and decision-making processes.

Conclusion: Visual explanation techniques like Ensemble-CAM improve transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems by making their decisions more interpretable and understandable to users.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework that extracts interpretable dynamical variables from videos using spatio-temporal attention and stability constraints, achieving robust latent representations and accurate long-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting true dynamical variables from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors like background motion, occlusions, and texture changes that obscure the underlying dynamics.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase 1 uses a TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions. Phase 2 selects meaningful dimensions via linear correlation analysis and refines dynamics with Lyapunov-based stability regularizer for contraction.

Result: Achieves best mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers lowest analytical mean squared error compared to CNN-based and transformer-only baselines.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are both accurate and physically interpretable for dynamical system analysis.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

*Shaohang Jia,Zhiyong Huang,Zhi Yu,Mingyang Hou,Shuai Miao,Han Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQ is a mixed-precision quantization framework that addresses non-uniform activation distributions and static weight codebooks through adaptive weight quantization with quantile-based initialization, EMA-based codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods face challenges with highly non-uniform activation distributions and static, mismatched codebooks in weight quantization, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) with three key innovations: quantile-based codebook initialization, EMA-based online codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation, plus hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping for activations.

Result: On ImageNet, ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18 with average 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies on CIFAR-10 validate individual component contributions.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively addresses quantization challenges through adaptive distribution-aware techniques, achieving superior performance with low bit-widths while maintaining hardware compatibility.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X provides a comprehensive solution for multimodal human motion generation with superior performance, enhanced consistency, and flexible control capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPL-NC is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that addresses prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between similar classes through class-aware prototype caching and negative contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer performance drops when deployment distributions diverge from training data, and existing test-time adaptation methods fail to address prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes.

Method: Proposes CPL-NC with two key components: 1) Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with rejuvenation for inactive classes; 2) Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism that identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. Uses asymmetric optimization to refine only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.

Result: Experiments on 15 benchmarks show CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances vision-language model generalization under distribution shifts by addressing prototype degradation and class confusion through adaptive prototype management and negative contrastive learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research community lacks large-scale, high-quality, open-access datasets from real images for text-guided image editing, constraining progress despite recent multimodal model advances.

Method: Leveraged Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real OpenImages photos, using fine-grained editing taxonomy, MLLM-based quality scoring, and careful curation to ensure content preservation and instruction faithfulness.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K provides a robust foundation for training and benchmarking next-generation text-guided image editing models by offering large-scale, high-quality, task-rich resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standardization in monocular depth estimation evaluation, with many metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood, making it difficult to properly assess model performance.

Method: The authors conduct quantitative analysis of existing metrics' sensitivity to ground truth perturbations, compare them to human judgment, and introduce new metrics based on relative surface normals along with visualization tools and composite metric creation methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic analysis of depth estimation metrics, identifies critical limitations in current evaluation practices, and offers improved metrics and tools for more reliable assessment of monocular depth estimation models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity found in real-world scenes, making it difficult to properly evaluate and improve point tracking methods.

Method: Created ITTO benchmark using videos from existing datasets and egocentric recordings with high-quality human annotations collected through multi-stage pipeline. Conducted rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art trackers on this benchmark.

Result: Existing tracking methods struggle significantly with ITTO's challenges, particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, revealing critical failure modes in current approaches.

*Alain Couvreur,Rakhi Pratihar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A recursive decoding algorithm for binary rank metric Reed-Muller codes that beats existing methods in asymptotic complexity and provides a natural rank metric counterpart to the Plotkin construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient decoding methods for rank metric Reed-Muller codes, inspired by the successful recursive decoding approach used for Hamming metric binary Reed-Muller codes.

Method: A recursive decoding algorithm based on the Plotkin "(u | u+v)" structure, specifically designed for binary rank metric Reed-Muller codes (when G = (Z/2Z)^m). Also proposes a generic Plotkin-like construction for matrix rank metric codes.

Result: The algorithm achieves better asymptotic complexity than existing Dickson matrix-based decoding methods for rank metric Reed-Muller codes, while providing a natural extension of Plotkin construction to rank metric codes.

Conclusion: The recursive approach successfully adapts Plotkin construction principles to rank metric codes, offering improved decoding efficiency and establishing a framework for constructing and decoding rank metric codes through recursive decomposition.

Abstract: In 2021, Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri introduced a new class of rank
metric codes which can be regarded as rank metric counterparts of Reed-Muller
codes. Given a finite Galois extension $\mathbb{L} / \mathbb{K}$, these codes
are defined as some specific $\mathbb{L}$-subspaces of the twisted group
algebra $\mathbb{L} [\textrm{G}]$. We investigate the decoding of such codes in
the "binary" case, \emph{i.e.,} when $\textrm{G} = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^m$.
Our approach takes its inspiration from the decoding of Hamming metric binary
Reed-Muller codes using their recursive Plotkin "$(u ~|~ u+v)$" structure. If
our recursive algorithm restricts to a specific subclass of rank metric
Reed-Muller codes, its asymptotic complexity beats that of the recently
proposed decoding algorithm for arbitrary rank metric Reed-Muller codes based
on Dickson matrices. Also, this decoder is of completely different nature and
leads a natural rank metric counterpart of the Plotkin construction. To
illustrate this, we also propose a generic Plotkin-like construction for matrix
rank metric codes with an associate decoder, which can be applied to any pair
of codes equipped with an efficient decoder.

*Nemanja Stefan Perović,Keshav Singh,Chih-Peng Li,Mark F. Flanagan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes an algorithm to optimize movable antennas in near-field ISAC systems, showing significant performance gains over fixed antennas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movable antennas can enhance ISAC system performance, but near-field spherical wave propagation poses challenges that need to be addressed.

Method: An alternating optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes sensing receive combiner, communication precoding matrices, sensing transmit beamformer, and user MA positions.

Result: MA-enabled near-field ISAC systems outperform fixed-antenna systems; higher WSR achieved when users closer to BS have larger weights; sensing performance more sensitive to SINR thresholds than communication.

Conclusion: Movable antennas provide substantial performance advantages in near-field ISAC systems, with optimal performance achieved through proper weight allocation and position optimization.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the
key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing
services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently
developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the
performance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant
challenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the
corresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we
maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining
a minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To
achieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive
combiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer
and the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation
results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial
performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed
antennas. Additionally, we demonstrate that the highest WSR is obtained when
larger weights are allocated to the users placed closer to the BS, and that the
sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the
communication performance.

TL;DR: AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD) enables rapid optimization of programmable wireless channels without explicit channel modeling, using deep unfolded ALD with DNNs for score gradient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches require simplified channel models that are crude approximations, while complex simulators or measurements provide more accurate descriptions but are impractical for rapid optimization needed when users move.

Method: Deep unfolded ALD algorithm using DNNs to estimate score gradients, trained with zero-order gradients and active learning to bypass explicit channel modeling and enhance generalization in dynamic environments.

Result: The method enables rapid and reliable channel parameter tuning with limited latency in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects.

Conclusion: AI-aided ALD provides an effective approach for optimizing programmable wireless channels without explicit modeling, supporting rapid adaptation in complex and dynamically changing environments.

Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make
it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional
approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a
simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters
each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude
approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained
via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on
AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit
channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we
design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a
training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order
gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling
optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the
proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our
results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable
channel parameter tuning with limited latency.

Method: Developed N-CRLB framework incorporating dynamic topology, hardware quality factor, phase noise, and cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis.

Result: Three key insights: hardware/phase noise create power-independent performance ceilings/floors; interference enables 5.5 dB opportunistic sensing gains; measurement correlations don't degrade performance and provide common-mode rejection benefits.

Conclusion: Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware (Γ_eff<0.01), oscillators (σ²_φ<10⁻²), and appropriate 3D geometry configurations.

Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware

Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology,
hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and
cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis
reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create
power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto
\sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto
\sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above
$\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference
coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated
gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi
antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when
properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode
rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines.
Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study investigates grasp-type-specific neural activity using EEG during visuomotor tasks, showing that low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information during both planning and execution phases, with better classification performance than traditional MRCP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While invasive recordings have decoded localized neural activity for grasp planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by noninvasive EEG remain poorly understood for visuomotor tasks.

Method: Used a novel vision-based grasping platform with EEG neuroimaging, isolating grasp-specific planning from execution phases. Applied Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to extract frequency-specific features and SVM classification for binary and multiclass scenarios.

Result: Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) showed consistent classification performance (75.3-77.8%) for precision vs. power discrimination across both phases, outperforming MRCP (61.1%). Higher-frequency activity (12-40 Hz) achieved 93.3% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp classification. Feature importance revealed discriminative features in frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp type during planning using noninvasive EEG, providing insights into large-scale brain network activation patterns for visuomotor tasks.

Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with
cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings
have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type
planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We
introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate
grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across
large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates
grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic
visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)
technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features
within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated
binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs.
power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against
traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency
oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during
planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification
performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power
discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40
Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp
classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature
importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within
frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.
This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp
type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

Result: The paper fills a gap in existing literature by providing a comprehensive review of AI-driven signal processing under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration, offering theoretical support for 6G system design.

Conclusion: The proposed MARA framework and AI-based optimization approaches provide crucial theoretical foundations for designing 6G wireless systems with high spectral efficiency and flexibility, addressing the challenges of geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration.

Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high
reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has
become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and
electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies
to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation
characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the
electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual
reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges
of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this
issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic
reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework
for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling
and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we
systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on
analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional
non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing
literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal
processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and
provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless
systems with high SE and flexibility.

### [82] [Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19256)
*Haiquan Zhao,Bei Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A robust spline adaptive filtering algorithm (SAF-GMBZ) is proposed to handle generalized Gaussian noise and impulse noise, with improved performance in nonlinear system identification and active noise control applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAF algorithms suffer from performance degradation under generalized Gaussian noise and impulse noise environments, and fail to effectively address outlier effects.

Method: Proposed SAF-GMBZ algorithm using generalized modified Blake-Zisserman robust approach, with theoretical analysis of step-size ranges and steady-state MSE. Also developed filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm for active noise control.

Result: SAF-GMBZ shows superior learning performance in GGN environments, with accurate theoretical steady-state MSE predictions. FcGMBZ demonstrates effectiveness in ANC applications under impulsive noise.

Conclusion: The proposed SAF-GMBZ and FcGMBZ algorithms successfully address the limitations of conventional SAF methods in noisy environments, providing robust performance for nonlinear system identification and active noise control.

Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic
learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system
identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive
filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance
degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit
significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior
research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects
caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified
Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is
proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior
learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the
step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by
introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence
accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC)
application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on
SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical
steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN
environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC
application under impulsive noise environment.

### [83] [A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19267)
*Shama Siddiqu,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Comparison of 802.11p standard protocol with FROG-MAC protocol for VANETs, showing FROG-MAC reduces delay and improves throughput for emergency traffic by using fragmentation with pauses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANETs handle multi-priority heterogeneous data including safety-critical messages, requiring differentiated service based on urgency. Standard 802.11p has limitations where emergency data must wait if non-critical transmissions are ongoing.

Method: Comparative study between 802.11p (using EDCA for prioritization) and FROG-MAC (which transmits normal packets in fragments with short pauses to allow urgent packet access). Performance evaluated through simulations measuring delay and throughput.

Result: FROG-MAC improves both delay and throughput performance parameters by providing early channel access to emergency traffic compared to 802.11p.

Conclusion: FROG-MAC's fragmentation approach with pauses between fragments effectively reduces waiting time for critical data, making it superior to 802.11p for handling emergency traffic in VANETs.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous
nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may
include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic
management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated
service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a
comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a
fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p
is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
(EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical
messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait.
FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with
short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel
during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay
and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves
both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the
emergency traffic.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: IoT-based sleep monitoring and cognitive assessment study reveals poor sleep quality and cognitive function among high school teachers in Pakistan, showing correlation between sleep quality and cognitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High school teachers face work stress and multitasking that negatively impact sleep quality and cognitive function, affecting their teaching abilities.

Method: Used IoT technology with smart watches (pulse rate and SpO2 sensors) to monitor sleep quality, and Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) for self-assessment of cognitive function across 208 teachers in Pakistan.

Result: Most teachers had poor sleep quality and cognitive function, with a clear link between these two variables indicating workload and other factors need improvement.

Conclusion: Improving teachers' well-being through better workload management will positively impact their teaching quality by enhancing sleep quality and cognitive function.

Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function
for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking
expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and
cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching
abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying
Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school
teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors
were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or
"good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment
Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function.
The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It
has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive
function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and
other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being,
which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: First application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for anomaly detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, using photodiode monitoring and implementing on both conventional and neuromorphic hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a low-power, real-time anomaly detection system for additive manufacturing processes, specifically detecting laser energy drops during LPBF printing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures.

Method: Used photodiode sensors to monitor plasma and infrared radiation from the melt pool, implemented SNNs on CPU, FPGA, and Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip, with spike latency adjustment to reduce noise masking.

Result: Successfully detected print processing anomalies caused by laser energy drops, with improved detection achieved through spike latency adjustment in the neural network.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips for real-time anomaly detection in additive manufacturing, creating a framework for edge computing applications in industrial processes.

Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies
generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers
in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser
generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring
technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations
reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect
sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm
is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central
processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on
neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by
adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of
information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work
demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an
edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a
framework for the process.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a rate-adaptive quantization framework for multi-edge cooperative inference that dynamically adjusts feature compression based on importance, using dynamic programming for optimal code rate allocation under bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and communication bandwidth limitations in AI-IoT systems where fixed compression ratios from all devices lead to inefficient communication resource utilization.

Method: Uses rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) to dynamically adjust code rate based on feature importance, and dynamic programming to allocate code rates across devices under bandwidth constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms fixed-rate quantization frameworks, achieving better balance between communication efficiency and inference performance on multi-view datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses communication inefficiency in multi-edge cooperative inference systems while maintaining inference performance under limited bandwidth.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things
(IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference
system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to
an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and
limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous
transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from
all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the
code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream
inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme.
Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited
bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to
allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on
multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable
balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under
limited bandwidth conditions.

Motivation: To provide comprehensive channel characterization and performance evaluation for 5G-R systems in high-speed railway environments, addressing the need for reliable communication in challenging mobile scenarios.

Method: Used ray-tracing simulations with dynamic narrow-beam channel modeling across three HSR scenarios (viaduct, cutting, station), implemented beam tracking for continuous train alignment, and employed Vienna 5G simulator with hardware-in-the-loop platform for performance assessment.

Result: Analyzed channel characteristics including path loss, shadow fading, fading severity, dispersion, and stationarity; evaluated system performance metrics like block error rate, throughput, spectral efficiency, and signal quality parameters.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable guidance for designing and optimizing 5G-R systems in high-speed railway environments through comprehensive channel characterization and performance analysis.

Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance
evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT)
simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including
viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam
channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that
ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics
are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as
non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading,
fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval.
The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined.
Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam
channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block
error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop
simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal
reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and
reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for
the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional time/frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot directly obtain Doppler information in high-mobility 6G scenarios, and DD domain methods remain underexplored despite their natural characterization of propagation environments.

Method: Proposes waveform design for sounding signals, detailed methodology including synchronization and CSF estimation, and an algorithm for enhancing measurement precision. Establishes a complete DD domain channel sounding system and conducts vehicle-to-infrastructure measurements in urban environments.

Result: Successfully derived measurement results including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral density, and number of multipath components, confirming method effectiveness for 6G high-mobility communications.

Conclusion: The proposed DD domain channel sounding method is effective for 6G high-mobility scenarios and provides valuable insights for advancing 6G high-mobility communication research.

Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission
technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G)
system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot
directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The
channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler
information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain
underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method
for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the
sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of
DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is
thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement
precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously
evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G
high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements
are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments.
Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral
density, number of multipath components, and other characteristics, are
derived, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and offer
helpful insights for advancing research on 6G high-mobility communications.

Motivation: To investigate security weaknesses in 3GPP 5G-NR TDoA-based UAV localization systems and develop effective countermeasures against sophisticated spoofing attacks in low-altitude urban environments.

Method: The authors optimize node selection strategies under A2G channel conditions, introduce merged-peak spoofing attacks, perform theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, and design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at LMF with recursive gradient descent-based robust localization.

Result: The study reveals fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks, demonstrates how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success, and validates the effectiveness of both optimization and security mechanisms through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses critical security vulnerabilities in 5G-NR UAV localization by providing simultaneous robust victim localization and spoofer localization capabilities, offering comprehensive protection against sophisticated spoofing attacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization
in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies
under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection
depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User
Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then
expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing
attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with
legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical
modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and
geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental
weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these
vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the
Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified
parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization
algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified
framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer
localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive
simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security
mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AFDM has superior security over OTFS against brute-force eavesdropping, with complexity scaling as O(N²) vs O(√N) respectively, making AFDM signals nearly undecodable while OTFS allows partial recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and compare the security robustness of AFDM and OTFS waveforms against passive eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation without knowledge of system parameters.

Method: Analytical complexity analysis of brute-force demodulation for both waveforms, comparing search complexity scaling with number of subcarriers N, and validating with bit error rate simulations.

Result: Brute-force complexity scales as O(√N) for OTFS and O(N²) for AFDM, with BER simulations showing AFDM signals remain nearly undecodable while OTFS allows partial signal recovery.

Conclusion: AFDM provides superior resilience against eavesdropping compared to OTFS due to its higher brute-force demodulation complexity, making it more secure for wireless communications.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of affine frequency division multiplexing
(AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive
eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under
the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in
AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must
search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results
show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS
and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers,
indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER)
simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains
nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal
recovery under equivalent conditions.

*Sahar Maleki,Reza Lashgari,Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli,Mohammad Komareji*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MLP neural networks outperform traditional models for tuning local field potential responses to contrast stimuli, successfully fitting more neural recordings across all response types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local field potentials (LFPs) show weaker and broader tuning than spike responses, requiring optimized methods to properly evaluate LFP responses and compare them with spiking activity.

Method: Proposed new tuning models for contrast response functions, distinguished supersaturating from linear/saturating CRFs using monotonicity index, and tested various identification methods including MLP, RBF, fuzzy models, neuro-fuzzy models, and LOLIMOT algorithm.

Result: MLP neural network demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, successfully tuning significantly more neural recordings of all three types (supersaturating, linear, saturating).

Conclusion: MLP neural network model can serve as a novel approach to measure better fitted contrast sensitivity tuning curves for neuronal populations than currently used models.

Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important
measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The
response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than
spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for
appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring
spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response
functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP
responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed.
Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by
using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then
identified through static identification methods including multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network,
fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT)
algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to
traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior
performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast
stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of
neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural
network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted
contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other
currently used models.

TL;DR: A novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz FMCW radar, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional phase-based methods for vital signs monitoring are susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent calibration requirements, limiting their practical deployment in multi-target scenarios.

Method: Integration of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for target detection/tracking, MUSIC algorithm for angle estimation, and adaptive spectral filtering for vital signs extraction using micro-Doppler energy variations instead of phase information.

Result: System accurately detects and separates vital signs of up to four targets within 5m range, achieving mean absolute errors of 1.2 bpm for respiration and 2.3 bpm for heart rates, outperforming traditional phase-based methods.

Conclusion: The micro-Doppler energy-based approach provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts, demonstrating superior performance in challenging multi-target scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust
multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated
Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are
susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent
calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar
returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a
comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing
(STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution
angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for
vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that
formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and
physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets.
The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that
provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental
results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can
accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within
\SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per
minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates,
respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared
to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target
scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

TL;DR: ECG and ICG features are evaluated for biometric identification, with ECG QRS-centric features showing highest discriminative power and robustness to emotional variation, while ICG BCX features provide complementary but less stable information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the discriminative capacity and emotional robustness of ECG and ICG features for biometric identification, addressing the need for reliable physiological biometric systems.

Method: Used 29 features across four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, morphological) with random forest models combined with multiple interpretability methods (Gini importance, permutation importance, SHAP values), feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms.

Result: ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, ranked highest in importance across all methods. Feature selection achieved 99% accuracy with only 14 features. QRS-related ECG features showed resilience to emotional variation while maintaining inter-individual differences.

Conclusion: Individuality for reliable biometric identification is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all domains, with ICG BCX features providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. QRS-centric descriptors are resilient to emotional variation due to stable physiological differences.

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance
cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their
discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29
features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological)
are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple
interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and
ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini
importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features,
particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In
parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower
cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial
multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across
highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions.
Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences
between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature
selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges
on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set
(99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary
analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification
is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains.
Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude,
providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed
resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable
inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations
in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate
their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

TL;DR: A 3D optimization framework for AI inference scaling that jointly optimizes accuracy, cost, and latency, addressing limitations of traditional 1D and 2D approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI inference scaling uses 1D heuristics or 2D trade-offs that fail to consider cost and latency constraints, leading to suboptimal deployment decisions.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations across three scenarios and nine simulated LLMs, evaluating four optimization methods for 3D multi-objective optimization.

Result: Knee-point optimization achieves the best balance across objectives, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling that captures feasible spaces missed by traditional approaches.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Motivation: Current AI models for functional neuroimages are limited by small sample sizes and self-supervised pretraining may not align well with brain-to-outcome relationships needed for clinical tasks.

Method: Multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and semi-supervised finetuning using pseudo-labels from pretrained BEI.

Result: Promising results on sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Schizophrenia.

Conclusion: The foundation model shows great potential to facilitate neuroimaging applications in clinical routines by leveraging rich environmental variables and demographic data.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [96] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO generalizes DPO with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions, improving performance under noisy preferences and providing practical variants for different noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, which may not handle uncertainty and noise well. ADPO aims to address these limitations through more flexible preference modeling.

Method: Introduces soft preference probabilities, arbitrary reference-policy anchors for stability, and listwise preference modeling via Plackett-Luce distributions. Provides three variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing.

Result: In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential RL, anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by 15-29% across CartPole and LunarLander tasks.

Conclusion: ADPO provides clear guidance: use pairwise anchored Soft-DPO for clean/moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for extreme contamination. The framework successfully transfers from single-step to multi-step settings.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

*Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot,Jean-Pierre Nadal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Category learning in neural networks enhances discrimination near category boundaries through expansion of neural space, driven by maximizing mutual information between categories and neural activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend theoretical framework from neuroscience to artificial networks, explaining how categorical perception emerges as a necessary outcome of efficient learning by minimizing Bayes cost.

Method: Mathematical framework showing that minimizing Bayes cost implies maximizing mutual information, which leads to appropriate projection space and neural representation with Fisher information matrix that follows category-specific Fisher information.

Result: Optimal learning induces expansion of neural space near decision boundaries, with Fisher information maxima near (but not exactly at) class boundaries, demonstrated in toy models and MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: Category learning naturally leads to categorical perception through information maximization principles, relating to Information Bottleneck approach and providing bias-variance decomposition of Bayes cost.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

TL;DR: Performance evaluation of MLX framework for transformer model inference on Apple silicon devices, comparing with PyTorch counterparts and showing MLX's potential for efficient on-device ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of LLMs and need for on-device deployment on smaller devices like laptops and mobile phones created demand for frameworks optimized for Apple silicon hardware.

Method: Created MLX-transformers framework with different transformer implementations in MLX, converted PyTorch checkpoints to MLX format, and benchmarked inference latency of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models on Apple Silicon devices against NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

Result: MLX demonstrates potential for enabling efficient and accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem through performance comparisons with PyTorch counterparts.

Conclusion: MLX shows promise for efficient transformer model inference on Apple silicon devices, with future work planned to extend evaluation to models of different modalities for more comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF/RLVR methods are highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards, but the interaction between such noise and group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise, applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias learning signals.

Result: Consistent improvements across math and code tasks, with gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions.

Conclusion: Bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three multiscale learning approaches using Partition of Unity with neural networks, SVD for mode separation, and Sparse High-Order SVD for limited measurements to capture both macro- and micro-scale dynamics in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning methods fail to capture high-frequency behaviors in complex multiscale systems due to inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions.

Method: 1) Partition of Unity method with neural networks to decompose dynamics into local components; 2) SVD to extract dominant modes separating macro- and micro-scale dynamics; 3) Sparse High-Order SVD for reconstruction from limited measurements.

Result: The framework accurately captures both coarse and fine dynamics, making it effective for real-world applications with complex multiscale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches provide effective multiscale learning that captures dynamics across all time scales, offering approximation and interpretation for complex multiscale systems even with limited data access.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAPO is a new RL method that addresses off-policy training challenges in LLM alignment by dynamically adjusting clipping bounds to balance positive/negative gradients and preserve entropy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is crucial for aligning LLMs but faces challenges in off-policy settings where stale data causes policy entropy decline, optimization instability, and potential collapse due to negative-advantage sample dominance and fixed clipping mechanisms.

Method: Proposed BAPO (Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping) which dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to re-balance positive/negative gradient contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization in off-policy scenarios including sample replay and partial rollout.

Result: BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. 7B model surpasses open-source counterparts like SkyWork-OR1-7B, while 32B model achieves SOTA results among same-scale models and outperforms proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking on AIME 2024/2025 benchmarks.

Conclusion: BAPO effectively addresses off-policy RL challenges through adaptive clipping and gradient balancing, enabling stable and efficient training of aligned LLMs that achieve competitive performance against both open-source and proprietary models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [102] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many post-mortem generalization measures for deep neural networks are fragile - small training modifications that barely affect the network can substantially change the measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that many commonly used generalization measures for DNNs are fragile and may not reliably reproduce qualitative generalization trends, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Method: Analyzed various post-mortem generalization measures (path norm, spectral norm, Frobenius norm, flatness proxies, deterministic PAC-Bayes surrogates) by testing their sensitivity to minor training modifications like learning rate adjustments and SGD variants.

Result: Found that many measures are fragile - small hyperparameter changes can reverse learning curve slopes, and some measures like PAC-Bayes origin fail to capture data complexity differences despite being considered reliable.

Conclusion: Developers of new generalization measures should explicitly audit them for fragility, and current post-mortem measures may not provide reliable insights into DNN generalization behavior.

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables fine-grained adaptation while maintaining memory efficiency by identifying important parameters and adding bypass connections that are updated during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the trade-off between addition-based methods (memory efficient but limited representational capacity) and selective in-situ adaptation (precise adaptation but high memory consumption).

Method: First identifies important parameters like selective adaptation, then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only bypass connections are updated while original parameters remain frozen.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 23+ tasks with ≤0.02% trainable parameters, reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

Conclusion: NeuroAda successfully enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency, outperforming existing PEFT methods.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial teacher-student distillation framework improves neural operators' out-of-distribution generalization by using differentiable numerical solvers as teachers and adversarial sampling to expand training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators like FNOs and DeepONets offer fast inference but suffer from poor out-of-distribution generalization, often failing on inputs outside training distribution.

Method: Adversarial teacher-student distillation with differentiable numerical solver supervising compact neural operator, plus PGD-style active sampling loop to find worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to expand training set.

Result: Experiments on Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems show adversarial distillation substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving low parameter cost and fast inference of neural operators.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial distillation framework successfully enhances neural operators' generalization capabilities without sacrificing their computational efficiency advantages.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm for time series anomaly detection that decomposes encoded representations into stable and auxiliary components, along with a mutual information-based metric to replace reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoencoders in unsupervised time series anomaly detection are sensitive to anomalies in training data, which reduces accuracy. Current methods using reconstruction errors have limitations when training with contaminated time series.

Method: Proposes an encode-then-decompose paradigm that decomposes encoded representations into stable and auxiliary representations, and introduces a mutual information based metric instead of reconstruction errors for anomaly identification.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multivariate and univariate time series benchmarks, and shows robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed encode-then-decompose approach with mutual information metric effectively addresses the sensitivity issue of autoencoders to anomalies in training data, providing robust anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGTs generalize decision trees with learnable shape functions for non-linear splits, maintaining interpretability while achieving better performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees use simple axis-aligned linear splits, requiring deep structures to capture non-linear effects, which reduces interpretability.

Method: Proposed Shape Generalized Trees (SGTs) with learnable axis-aligned shape functions per node, ShapeCART induction algorithm, and extensions for bivariate functions (S²GT) and multi-way trees (SGT_K).

Result: Experiments show SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Conclusion: SGTs provide interpretable, visually explainable models that capture non-linear patterns more efficiently than traditional decision trees.

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLAR is a reinforcement learning-based approach for selecting backdoor-critical layers in federated learning attacks, achieving higher success rates while maintaining stealthiness against advanced defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor-critical layer selection methods in federated learning are rule-based and don't consider layer interrelations, making them ineffective and detectable by advanced defenses.

Method: POLAR uses policy-based reinforcement learning with Bernoulli sampling to dynamically learn attack strategies, optimizing layer selection through policy gradient updates based on backdoor success rate improvements, with regularization to limit modified layers.

Result: POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40% against six state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: POLAR demonstrates that reinforcement learning can effectively solve the backdoor-critical layer selection problem, achieving high attack success while maintaining stealthiness in federated learning environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%

### [109] [Weight Decay may matter more than muP for Learning Rate Transfer in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19093)
*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: muP's learning rate scaling primarily acts as implicit warmup rather than maintaining stable update dynamics; weight decay is the key factor for successful learning rate transfer across neural network widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient training at large scales where hyperparameter tuning is expensive by transferring optimal learning rates from small to large neural networks.

Method: Large-scale empirical investigation of Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) assumptions and comparison with weight decay effects on update dynamics across different model widths.

Result: muP's assumptions hold only briefly at training start; weight decay stabilizes update dynamics for most of training, and muP primarily acts as implicit learning rate warmup.

Conclusion: Weight decay, not muP scaling, is the key factor for learning rate transfer; muP can be largely replaced with modified warmup schedules, challenging prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer.

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

### [110] [What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19099)
*Yaning Jia,Chunhui Zhang,Xingjian Diao,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhongyu Ouyang,soroush vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning effectiveness depends on model capability, task complexity, and difficulty metrics - no universal strategy exists. Forward vs reverse curriculum performance varies by model and task, with task-aligned curricula shaping representations while inner-state curricula modulate confidence and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate when curriculum learning helps, which direction (forward/reverse) is better, and whether the answer depends on measurement metrics, given disparate approaches in prior work.

Method: Unified offline evaluation framework with five difficulty dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B.

Result: No curriculum strategy dominates universally; forward vs reverse CL effectiveness depends on model capability and task complexity; samples at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains; task-aligned curricula shape final representations while inner-state curricula modulate internal states.

Conclusion: No universal curriculum strategy exists - effectiveness depends on model-task combinations. Prioritizing decision-uncertain samples may enhance learning outcomes. Findings challenge universal curriculum assumptions and provide actionable guidance across model and task regimes.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

### [111] [MetaCluster: Enabling Deep Compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19105)
*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster enables high compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by using a meta-learner to map embeddings to coefficient vectors that lie on a low-dimensional manifold, then clustering and replacing per-edge vectors with shared centroids, achieving up to 80× parameter reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs replace scalar weights with vector coefficients, increasing expressivity but also dramatically increasing parameters and memory usage, creating a need for compression techniques.

Method: A lightweight meta-learner is jointly trained with KAN to map low-dimensional embeddings to coefficient vectors on a low-dimensional manifold. K-means clustering is then applied in coefficient space to replace per-edge vectors with shared centroids, followed by fine-tuning of the centroid codebook.

Result: On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, MetaCluster achieves up to 80× reduction in parameter storage across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, with no loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaCluster successfully makes KANs highly compressible by exploiting the vector nature of their parameters, enabling significant storage reduction while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [112] [Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19119)
*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies learning peer influence probabilities in networked environments using contextual linear bandits, addressing the trade-off between regret minimization and estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of peer influence probabilities is crucial for understanding information diffusion and improving viral marketing, but learning from data is challenging due to heterogeneous influence relationships and limitations of existing methods.

Method: Proposes an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm within a contextual linear bandit framework that can tune parameters to achieve different trade-offs between regret minimization and estimation error.

Result: Experiments on semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrate advantages over static methods and contextual bandits that ignore the trade-off between regret and estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the fundamental trade-off between regret minimization and estimation error in learning peer influence probabilities, enabling flexible tuning based on application needs.

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

### [113] [Steering Autoregressive Music Generation with Recursive Feature Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19127)
*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM adapts Recursive Feature Machines to enable fine-grained control over pre-trained music models by steering internal activations, achieving high note accuracy while maintaining prompt fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable music generation methods often require model retraining or introduce audible artifacts, creating a need for methods that can control frozen models without compromising quality.

Method: Train lightweight RFM probes to discover interpretable concept directions in MusicGen's hidden states, then inject these directions during inference to guide generation in real-time without per-step optimization.

Result: Increased accuracy of generating target musical notes from 0.23 to 0.82 while maintaining text prompt adherence within 0.02 of the unsteered baseline.

Conclusion: MusicRFM successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality, enabling effective fine-grained control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

### [114] [InvarGC: Invariant Granger Causality for Heterogeneous Interventional Time Series under Latent Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19138)
*Ziyi Zhang,Shaogang Ren,Xiaoning Qian,Nick Duffield*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC) to address limitations of traditional Granger causality by handling latent confounders and unknown interventions through cross-environment heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Granger causality fails with non-linear relationships and relies on unrealistic assumptions of causal sufficiency and known interventions. Real-world time series often have latent confounders and unknown intervention targets.

Method: Leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate latent confounding effects and distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments at edge-level granularity, recovering invariant causal relations.

Result: Establishes identifiability under latent confounding and unknown interventions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InvarGC effectively addresses key limitations of existing Granger causality methods by handling latent confounders and unknown interventions through environmental heterogeneity, demonstrating strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [115] [Subliminal Corruption: Mechanisms, Thresholds, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19152)
*Reya Vir,Sarvesh Bhatnagar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Subliminal corruption in AI systems occurs when undesirable traits spread through semantically neutral synthetic data, bypassing safety checks and causing behavioral degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine learning models increasingly use synthetic data for fine-tuning, there's a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through interconnected AI systems, requiring quantitative understanding of this phenomenon.

Method: Used teacher-student setup with GPT-2 to systematically study scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms of subliminal corruption through controlled experiments.

Result: Found three key findings: behavioral crossover degrading overall alignment, sharp phase transition at critical poisoned data threshold, and corruption mechanism mimicking natural fine-tuning making detection difficult.

Conclusion: Demonstrates critical vulnerability in AI systems using synthetic data and highlights need for new safety protocols to address latent threats.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

### [116] [Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155)
*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes feature space adaptation methods (LoRFA and VeFA) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in model fine-tuning, achieving comparable performance to LoRA while improving robustness under distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning when downstream data is limited or differs from pre-training, and to prevent overwriting pre-trained knowledge by avoiding weight space modifications.

Method: Two feature space adaptation methods: LoRFA (Low-Rank Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation), which compensate for downstream lurking variables via lightweight feature-level transformations while preserving pre-trained representations.

Result: Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results to LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG tasks, while consistently demonstrating stronger robustness under distribution shift.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning in feature space rather than weight space better preserves pre-trained knowledge and enhances model generalization and robustness, making it a promising approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

### [117] [Instance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Nonstochastic Linear Partial Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19158)
*Federico Di Gennaro,Khaled Eldowa,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a nonstochastic linear partial monitoring framework with finite actions, using exploration-by-optimization to achieve efficient algorithms with improved regret bounds that transparently depend on game structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend partial monitoring to infinite outcome spaces while maintaining linear structure, and to develop more transparent regret bounds that better reflect the alignment between observations and losses.

Method: Uses an exploration-by-optimization approach for efficient implementation in adversarial linear partial monitoring with finite actions.

Result: Achieves instance-specific regret bounds with √T rate for locally observable games and T^{2/3} for globally observable games, with tight dependence on game structure.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides efficient algorithms with transparent regret guarantees that match known stochastic bounds and demonstrate tight game structure dependence.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vision-language model (VLM) using Qwen2.5-VL is developed to classify mouse behaviors from videos with text input, producing behavioral vectors over time without fine-tuning through prompts, in-context learning, and frame preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scientific explorations by integrating diverse data and enabling interdisciplinary researchers to study mouse behavior through comprehensive behavioral datasets across multiple time points and environments.

Method: Uses Qwen2.5-VL model enhanced with prompts, in-context learning with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing to classify mouse behaviors from videos without model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like freezing and fleeing, and produces valuable behavioral vector datasets with high accuracy and minimal user input.

Conclusion: The model successfully supports interdisciplinary mouse behavior research by enabling integration of diverse behavioral features into comprehensive datasets for complex research questions.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) for non-conjugate models, establishing convergence guarantees and uncovering hidden convexity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NGVI is widely used but lacks theoretical understanding, especially for non-conjugate likelihoods where variational loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze.

Method: Focus on mean-field parameterization; derive conditions for relative smoothness; propose modified NGVI with non-Euclidean projections; analyze hidden convexity under structural assumptions.

Result: Established sufficient conditions for relative smoothness; proved global non-asymptotic convergence to stationary point; showed fast global convergence to optimum under additional assumptions.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into geometry and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging non-conjugate inference settings, advancing theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

*Runzhe Wu,Ankur Samanta,Ayush Jain,Scott Fujimoto,Jeongyeol Kwon,Ben Kretzu,Youliang Yu,Kaveh Hassani,Boris Vidolov,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task post-training of LLMs suffers from gradient imbalance where certain tasks produce much larger gradients, biasing optimization toward those tasks despite not necessarily providing better learning gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task post-training assumes all tasks contribute similar gradient magnitudes, but this assumption fails in RL post-training, leading to biased optimization that doesn't reflect actual learning benefits.

Method: The paper analyzes gradient magnitudes across different tasks during RL post-training and compares them with actual learning gains (performance improvements).

Result: Large-gradient tasks don't necessarily yield better learning gains - they can achieve similar or even lower performance improvements than small-gradient tasks. Gradient imbalances arise from inherent task differences rather than typical training statistics.

Conclusion: Naive dataset mixing in multi-task post-training is problematic due to gradient imbalances, calling for principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized actor-critic framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with limited communication, using local policy updates and neural network value approximation to reduce communication burden while maintaining coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication bottleneck in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems where agents have limited communication capabilities, aiming to reduce communication overhead while preserving coordination.

Method: Decentralized actor-critic learning where each agent performs multiple local updates of policy and value function (approximated by multi-layer neural networks) before exchanging information with neighbors, reducing communication frequency.

Result: Achieved finite-time convergence with sample complexity O(ε⁻³) and communication complexity O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹), where τ is number of local training steps. Error bound depends on neural network approximation quality. Numerical experiments validated theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces communication burden in multi-agent systems while maintaining coordination, with proven convergence guarantees and practical validation through cooperative control experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

### [122] [An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202)
*Mengying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADGNN introduces active diffusion to overcome over-smoothing in GNNs by integrating external information sources and enabling true infinite diffusion through closed-form solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based GNNs suffer from over-smoothing and limited global information capture due to passive heat diffusion, similar to the heat death of the universe where node representations converge to identical vectors.

Method: Proposes Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN) that integrates multiple external information sources to dynamically influence diffusion, and calculates closed-form solutions for true infinite diffusion.

Result: ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks, effectively capturing global graph information while maintaining node distinctiveness.

Conclusion: Active diffusion with external information sources successfully overcomes over-smoothing and enables comprehensive global graph understanding while preserving node uniqueness.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

TL;DR: A collaborative learning framework for GNNs where student models mutually teach each other without a pre-trained teacher, using adaptive logit weighting and entropy enhancement to improve performance on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional knowledge distillation that requires pre-trained teacher models, and enable lightweight GNNs to learn collaboratively for better performance on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes collaborative learning among ensembles of student GNNs with adaptive logit weighting unit for efficient knowledge exchange and entropy enhancement technique for improved mutual learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets for both node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing that simple shallow GNNs can achieve better inference performance through collaborative learning.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning among GNNs without pre-trained teachers is effective, enabling lightweight models to synergistically learn and outperform traditional knowledge distillation approaches, particularly for multiple tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Youngsik Hwang,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning reframed as multi-objective optimization with CUP algorithm that navigates Pareto frontier using unlearning intensity parameter, achieving superior trade-off control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of single-objective unlearning: risk of over-forgetting, lack of fine-grained control, and absence of holistic evaluation metrics for the efficacy-fidelity trade-off.

Method: Propose CUP algorithm with pivoting gradient mechanism that controllably navigates entire Pareto frontier using single hyperparameter 'unlearning intensity' for precise trade-off selection.

Result: CUP produces superior Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across various vision tasks as measured by hypervolume indicator.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization framework with CUP algorithm effectively addresses machine unlearning challenges by providing controllable navigation of trade-offs between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how various design choices in time series foundation models (TSFMs) create implicit biases that affect model behavior, rather than proposing a new model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different training process "knobs" affect model quality in TSFMs, moving beyond simply benchmarking performance to uncover the underlying biases in model design.

Method: Uses a combination of theory and controlled empirical evaluation to examine design choices like patch size, embedding choice, and training objectives, and their resulting biases.

Result: Identified that design choices lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties including temporal behavior, geometric structure, and regression tendencies. These biases can be intuitive or counterintuitive depending on model and data properties.

Conclusion: Multiple biases can interact in complex ways, as shown in a case study on outlier handling. The findings have implications for learning the "bitter lesson" and building better TSFMs.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes decision-making, but optimizing decision tree policies in MDPs remains challenging.

Method: Formulates the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and employs a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints for efficient parallel search.

Result: Achieves substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with significantly higher number of states. Produces interpretable and compact decision tree policies that maintain transparency without compromising performance.

Conclusion: SPOT simultaneously achieves interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as

significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster

TL;DR: SILVER with RL-guided labeling extends the original SILVER framework to handle multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating RL policy outputs into boundary identification, improving interpretability while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL achieves strong performance but lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. Existing SILVER framework is restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains.

Method: Extracts compact feature representations from images, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, uses RL-guided labeling to generate boundary datasets, and trains surrogate models (decision trees, regression functions) to interpret RL policy decisions.

Result: Maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior in Atari environments with three deep RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Transforms SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings, advancing explainable RL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

TL;DR: GraMixC is a plug-and-play module that extracts hierarchical cluster configurations from Vision Transformers, aligns them using RMS technique, and fuses them via attention to improve downstream prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans naturally group objects by similarity, and recent community detection advances enable discovery of hierarchical clusterings without labeled data. The paper aims to leverage these configurations found in Vision Transformers, which are less redundant than register tokens and don't require ad hoc selection.

Method: Introduces GraMixC module that extracts configurations, aligns them using Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via attention heads before downstream prediction. Can be learned through unsupervised or self-supervised methods.

Result: On DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, improves R2 score from 0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting new state of the art. Consistently outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines on standard tabular benchmarks.

Conclusion: Configurations provide effective hierarchical clustering structures that can be extracted and fused to significantly improve downstream prediction performance across various tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GNN regression tasks is underexplored, with existing approaches mainly targeting classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression.

Method: Multi-level framework with structure-level edge reweighting, representation-level alignment via MMD, and prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies for GNN-based node regression tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities

TL;DR: CAB is a novel distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models using token-level supervision and flexible layer-wise alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models offer superior scalability but have costly training and less mature ecosystem compared to Transformers. Structural heterogeneity makes it challenging to distill knowledge from pretrained attention models.

Method: Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB) with token-level supervision through lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies.

Result: Extensive experiments across vision and language domains show consistent performance improvements for state-space models, even with limited training data, outperforming standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.

Conclusion: Attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian distillation compresses deep ensembles into student distributions using deep latent factor models, outperforming existing methods while maintaining uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles provide state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification but are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting practical deployment. Existing knowledge distillation methods struggle to preserve uncertainty when compressing models.

Method: Proposes Gaussian distillation using deep latent factor models to estimate teacher ensemble distributions. Uses expectation-maximization algorithm to stably estimate mean and covariance functions, treating ensemble members as realizations of a stochastic process.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on multiple benchmark datasets. Works well for language model fine-tuning and distribution shift problems while preserving uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Gaussian distillation effectively compresses ensemble models into distributions rather than ensembles, maintaining uncertainty quantification capabilities while reducing computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

TL;DR: QiMeng-SALV proposes signal-aware learning for Verilog code generation by leveraging functionally correct output signal code segments to optimize RL training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 7B model matching DeepSeek v3 671B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of meaningful functional rewards hinders preference optimization based on RL for generating functionally correct Verilog code in automated circuit design.

Method: Extract verified signal-aware implementations from partially incorrect modules by comparing signal functional correctness with reference modules, using AST to identify signal-aware code segments, and introducing signal-aware DPO optimized on correct signal-level code segments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks, with 7B parameter model matching DeepSeek v3 671B performance and significantly outperforming CodeV on same dataset.

Conclusion: Proposes paradigm shift from module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, effectively addressing insufficient functional rewards issue.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) introduce a deterministic latent pathway to preserve distributional information in discrete diffusion models, overcoming the sampling wall problem and achieving substantial improvements in text generation quality and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models suffer from a sampling wall where categorical sampling collapses rich distributional information into one-hot vectors, preventing information propagation across steps and limiting subsequent generation quality.

Method: Loopholing mechanism preserves distributional information via a deterministic latent pathway, trained efficiently with self-conditioning strategy to create LDDMs.

Result: LDDMs reduce generative perplexity by up to 61% over prior baselines, close/surpass the gap with autoregressive models, produce more coherent text, and improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks like Countdown and Game of 24.

Conclusion: Loopholing mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: Traditional species monitoring methods have limited coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling helps address these gaps but needs improvement for more accurate predictions, especially with sparse data.

Method: Applied deep learning and data imputation techniques, including data balancing, feature selection, and multimodal ensemble models integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental variables.

Result: Data balancing reduced MAE from 189 to 29 in frog counting. Multimodal ensemble model outperformed individual models with robust generalization. Fusion of image and tabular data achieved 84.9% accuracy and AUC 0.90 in habitat classification.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques (balancing, imputation) significantly improve ecological modeling accuracy for biodiversity monitoring when data are sparse or incomplete.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model

TL;DR: The Ring-linear model series introduces hybrid attention architecture combining linear and softmax attention, achieving 10x inference cost reduction vs 32B dense models and 50% cost reduction vs original Ring series, with improved training efficiency through FP8 operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios by developing efficient hybrid attention architectures that reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Developed Ring-mini-linear-2.0 (16B params) and Ring-flash-linear-2.0 (104B params) models with hybrid linear+softmax attention architecture, systematically explored attention mechanism ratios, and leveraged custom FP8 operator library (linghe) for training optimization.

Result: Achieved 10x inference cost reduction compared to 32B dense models and over 50% cost reduction vs original Ring series. Training efficiency improved by 50% through FP8 operators. Models maintain SOTA performance on multiple complex reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Ring-linear series demonstrates that hybrid attention architectures with optimized linear-softmax ratios can significantly reduce inference costs while maintaining high performance, enabled by efficient training-inference engine alignment and custom operator optimization.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: Current time-series foundation models focus on forecast accuracy but overlook that different operational tasks require specific forecast types (point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensembles). Many models produce inadequate forecast forms for practical applications.

Method: Surveyed recent TSFMs, established when forecast types can be converted between forms, proved mathematical limitations of marginal distributions for path-dependent events, and mapped operational tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types.

Result: Found that two-thirds of TSFMs produce only point or parametric forecasts, while trajectory ensembles are required for many operational tasks. Demonstrated that marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities due to infinite joint distributions sharing identical marginals.

Conclusion: Forecast type, not just accuracy, determines practical utility. The paper provides a framework for task-aligned evaluation and clarifies when forecast form differentiates operational value.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

### [139] [A New Type of Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19347)
*Xingyang Nie,Guojie Xiao,Su Pan,Biao Wang,Huilin Ge,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new type of adversarial examples that are significantly different from original examples but produce the same model output, proposing several novel algorithms including NI-FGSM, NI-FGM, and their momentum variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing security concerns. This research explores the opposite approach - creating examples that are substantially different but yield identical model outputs.

Method: Proposed novel algorithms: negative iterative fast gradient sign method (NI-FGSM), negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM), and their momentum variants (NMI-FGSM and NMI-FGM) to generate adversarial examples that are significantly different from originals but produce same outputs.

Result: Adversarial examples constructed by these methods can be used to attack machine learning systems. Results show adversarial examples are not just distributed near original examples but extensively throughout the sample space.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that adversarial examples exist extensively in the sample space beyond just the neighborhood of original examples, and the proposed methods can effectively generate such examples for potential attacks on ML systems.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BBMDP introduces a principled MDP formulation for variable selection in Branch and Bound, enabling use of standard RL algorithms to learn optimal branching heuristics that outperform prior state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variable selection heuristics significantly impact B&B solver performance in MILP problems. Existing RL approaches use ad hoc formulations, lacking a principled MDP framework that can leverage standard RL algorithms.

Method: Developed BBMDP - a vanilla Markov Decision Process formulation for variable selection in Branch and Bound, allowing application of broad range of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal branching policies.

Result: The branching agent based on BBMDP outperformed prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks in computational experiments.

Conclusion: BBMDP provides a principled MDP framework that successfully enables learning optimal branching heuristics using standard RL algorithms, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Scalable LinUCB introduces a low-rank approximation method to reduce computational and memory costs of LinUCB for recommender systems, achieving O(dr) complexity per step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LinUCB's training, inference, and memory costs grow prohibitively with feature dimensionality and action space size due to expensive matrix operations on the design matrix.

Method: Uses dynamical low-rank parametrization of inverse Cholesky factors with rank-1 and batched updates, plus projector-splitting integrator for memory control.

Result: Achieves O(dr) per-step update cost and memory usage for approximation rank r, with O(dr) inference complexity per action evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed Scalable LinUCB algorithm effectively reduces computational and memory requirements while maintaining performance on recommender system datasets.

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

TL;DR: ConvXformer is a hybrid neural network combining ConvNeXt blocks and Transformer encoders for inertial navigation, with a differential privacy mechanism that maintains positioning accuracy while protecting training data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based inertial tracking systems are vulnerable to privacy breaches that expose sensitive training data, and existing differential privacy solutions often degrade model performance by adding excessive noise to high-frequency inertial measurements.

Method: Proposed ConvXformer hybrid architecture fusing ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders, plus an efficient differential privacy mechanism with adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI), using truncated singular value decomposition for gradient processing.

Result: Achieved more than 40% improvement in positioning accuracy on benchmark datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) while ensuring (ε,δ)-differential privacy guarantees, and demonstrated robustness on the Mech-IO dataset under severe environmental distortions.

Conclusion: The framework provides secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical systems by balancing privacy protection with high positioning accuracy, even in challenging environments with intense magnetic fields.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet is a dynamic fairness correction framework that uses bias detection and conditional LoRA to selectively apply fairness corrections only to biased instances, preserving performance on unbiased data while handling various levels of sensitive attribute availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods often compromise model performance, use static correction strategies, struggle with data sparsity in minority groups, and have suboptimal use of sensitive attributes - either over-relying on complete labeling or ignoring them entirely.

Method: Integrates bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) that activates fairness correction only for biased instances, plus a contrastive loss function to minimize intra-class representation disparities across sensitive groups and address minority group underfitting.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows FairNet can enhance worst-group performance without diminishing overall performance, with potential slight improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: FairNet provides a flexible framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness correction that works with complete, partial, or absent sensitive attribute labels, addressing key limitations of existing debiasing methods.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Motivation: The training of diffusion models is often overlooked in optimization technique evaluations, creating a need to benchmark recent algorithms specifically for diffusion model training.

Method: Benchmarking various optimization algorithms (Muon, SOAP, AdamW, Adam, SGD) for training diffusion models on denoising flow trajectories, while analyzing learning-rate schedule impacts.

Result: Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW, achieving 18% lower final loss. The study also reveals insights about learning-rate schedule impacts and Adam vs SGD performance gap in diffusion training.

Conclusion: Recent optimization algorithms like Muon and SOAP offer significant improvements over traditional AdamW for diffusion model training, and careful consideration of learning-rate schedules is crucial for optimal performance.

Abstract: The training of diffusion models is often absent in the evaluation of new

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust meta-learning approach that can efficiently infer conditional posterior distributions for quick adaptation to new tasks in few-shot learning scenarios.

Method: Uses Neural Variational Dropout Processes with task-specific dropout and a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model for memory-efficient mapping of dropout rates from few observed contexts, combined with amortized variational inference.

Result: NVDPs demonstrated excellent performance compared to other meta-learning approaches in 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification tasks.

Conclusion: NVDPs provide a robust and efficient Bayesian meta-learning framework that can handle functional ambiguities and uncertainties while enabling quick reconfiguration of neural networks for new tasks.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

### [146] [LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19383)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extract monotonic proxies for system 'age' from multivariate time series data by combining sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high monotonicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many systems age or degrade over time, but available sensors may not directly provide this 'age' information. The goal is to discover latent functions of sensors that can serve as monotonic proxies for system aging.

Method: Using a carefully defined grammar, the approach generates candidate equations from available sensors and optimizes them for monotonicity using absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time and candidate formulas.

Result: The method successfully combines sensors with low individual monotonicity (e.g., ρ=0.13 and 0.09) into features with high monotonicity (ρ=0.95). It was validated on artificial and real-world datasets including structural health monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed system can find interpretable equations that serve as effective proxies for system 'age' by discovering latent monotonic features from multivariate sensor data.

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A roadmap for AI safety using chain-of-thought monitoring to detect dangerous capabilities, addressing threats like neuralese and encoded reasoning through faithfulness techniques and prediction markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where traditional safety cases become insufficient, alternative approaches are needed to ensure safety.

Method: Proposes a two-part safety case: (1) models lack dangerous capabilities without CoT, (2) dangerous capabilities enabled by CoT are detectable by monitoring. Examines threats to monitorability (neuralese, encoded reasoning) and evaluates techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness.

Result: Systematically categorizes threats into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, alien reasoning) and analyzes their drivers. Explores extracting monitorable CoT from non-monitorable reasoning. Establishes prediction markets to assess viability.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases, providing an alternative approach to AI safety when traditional methods become insufficient.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner is a dynamic graph-text alignment framework that adaptively switches between many-to-many and one-to-one alignment strategies based on real-time supervision quality assessment, addressing limitations of existing CLIP-style aligners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-text aligners assume strict one-to-one node-text correspondences and use static alignment objectives, which fail to handle real-world many-to-many relations and are brittle under noisy supervision.

Method: ADAligner dynamically estimates batch-level alignment reliability and adapts optimization strategy accordingly - using soft many-to-many alignment for clean supervision and conservative one-to-one alignment with filtering for noisy cases.

Result: ADAligner outperforms prior methods on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval across nine datasets, maintains robustness under noise, and accelerates pre-training by 2-3x.

Conclusion: ADAligner provides a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning by dynamically adapting alignment strategies to supervision quality, with proven theoretical convergence and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

TL;DR: INPO is an influence-aware negative preference optimization framework for graph unlearning that slows divergence speed and improves model utility by targeting high-influence edges and using topological entropy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph unlearning models using gradient ascent on forget sets cause rapid utility degradation due to fast divergence speed.

Method: Uses influence-aware message function to amplify influence of unlearned edges, estimates edge influence via removal-based method, and applies topological entropy loss to preserve local structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while maintaining model utility across five real-world datasets.

Conclusion: INPO effectively addresses the utility degradation problem in graph unlearning by controlling divergence speed and preserving topological information.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Li,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPSVD is a novel SVD-based LLM compression method that selectively preserves columns with high decomposition errors and applies SVD only to columns with low errors, achieving better compression than uniform SVD approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD-based LLM compression methods treat parameter matrices uniformly, ignoring that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different matrix parts, leading to suboptimal compression performance.

Method: CPSVD intelligently segments parameter matrices by identifying columns with high decomposition errors (preserving them directly) and applying SVD only to columns with low errors. It also adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates across different modules within layers while maintaining target layer-wise compression ratios.

Result: Extensive experiments show CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: CPSVD provides a more refined approach to SVD-based LLM compression by accounting for heterogeneous decomposition errors across matrix columns and modules, leading to superior compression performance compared to uniform SVD methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method for SVD-based LLM compression that optimizes rank allocation across linear modules under global compression constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD compression methods for LLMs have limitations: heuristic algorithms explore restricted solution spaces, mask-based training struggles to capture relationships between singular values and parameters, and current methods overlook the non-smooth gain function property at compression ratio 1, leading to suboptimal local minima.

Method: ARA introduces: (1) a dedicated mask design for efficient mapping between retained ranks and trainable parameters, and (2) an additional loss function to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions.

Result: On LLaMA2-7B with 80% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42 and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared to uniform compression.

Conclusion: ARA effectively addresses rank allocation challenges in SVD-based LLM compression, achieving superior performance through optimized rank distribution across linear modules.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Conclusion: Establishes design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outlines pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

### [153] [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399)
*Yulun Wu,Miguel Aguiar,Karl H. Johansson,Matthieu Barreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IFeF-PINN is an iterative training algorithm that uses Random Fourier Features to overcome spectral bias in PINNs by enriching the latent space with high-frequency components, enabling better approximation of high-frequency PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where networks tend to learn low-frequency features first, limiting their ability to solve high-frequency PDE problems.

Method: Proposes IFeF-PINN with two-stage training: (1) estimate basis in feature space using Random Fourier Features for high-frequency enrichment, (2) perform regression to determine coefficients of enhanced basis functions. The iterative scheme is proven to converge for linear models.

Result: Extensive numerical evaluation shows superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms on classical benchmark problems, with improved approximation across the frequency domain.

Conclusion: Random Fourier Features effectively enhance the expressive capacity of PINNs, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs and overcoming spectral bias through the proposed iterative training scheme.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

*Ruiyao Miao,Junren Xiao,Shiya Tsang,Hui Xiong,Yingnian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REBMBO integrates Gaussian Processes with Energy-Based Models and uses PPO for multi-step lookahead to overcome one-step bias in Bayesian Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BO methods suffer from one-step bias leading to local optima convergence and poor performance in complex tasks, while Black-Box Optimization has shown success in costly function evaluation scenarios.

Method: Combines Gaussian Processes for local guidance with Energy-Based Models for global structure, frames BO iterations as MDPs, and uses Proximal Policy Optimization for adaptive multi-step lookahead.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks confirm superior performance, with additional analyses showing adaptability and robustness across various GP configurations.

Conclusion: REBMBO effectively overcomes limitations of traditional BO methods through its integrated approach and adaptive multi-step exploration strategy.

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

*Markus Bujotzek,Evelyn Trautmann,Calum Hand,Ian Hales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates federated clustering methods for analyzing distributed molecular data in pharmaceutical drug discovery, benchmarking three approaches against centralized counterparts using both standard and chemistry-informed metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods in drug discovery are limited by reliance on public datasets lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative training but complicates data-centric tasks like diversity estimation and chemical space analysis.

Method: Benchmarked three federated clustering approaches: Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated PCA with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH) against centralized counterparts on eight molecular datasets. Introduced SF-ICF chemistry-informed evaluation metric.

Result: Large-scale benchmarking with in-depth explainability analysis showed the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Conclusion: Federated clustering methods can effectively disentangle and represent distributed molecular data, with chemistry-informed metrics and explainability analyses being crucial for meaningful diversity analysis in pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

### [156] [LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19422)
*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'squeezing effect' in current unlearning methods where probability mass is redistributed to semantically related rephrasings of target responses, leading to spurious unlearning. It proposes a bootstrapping framework that incorporates model beliefs to counter this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods using gradient ascent have a critical side effect where they redistribute probability mass to high-likelihood regions corresponding to semantically related rephrasings of target responses, resulting in only spurious unlearning that automated metrics fail to detect.

Method: Proposes a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's high-confidence generations (model beliefs). BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, while BS-S (sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of the approach in achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping framework successfully counters the squeezing effect by incorporating model beliefs into the unlearning objective, enabling more comprehensive removal of sensitive content while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the modified universality hypothesis for adversarially robust models, finding partial universality in specific settings but not strict universality across different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the generality of Jones et al.'s (2022) modified universality hypothesis which suggests adversarially robust models trained for the same task are highly similar.

Method: Revisiting and testing the hypothesis across different datasets, examining representational similarity and predictive behavior convergence with increasing robustness.

Result: Verified high representational similarity in specific settings but inconsistent across datasets; predictive behavior does not converge with increasing robustness; differing predictions originate in classification layer but can be improved with classifier retraining.

Conclusion: Points towards partial universality in specific settings and away from notions of strict universality for adversarially robust neural networks.

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO is a scalable framework that accelerates Direct Preference Optimization for protein language models by clustering sequences and using group-based approximations, achieving similar performance with 1.8-3.7x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO faces scalability issues as training pairs grow quadratically with labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive training times even for modest datasets.

Method: Uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs while preserving training signal, and amortizes likelihood computations with group-based approximations.

Result: Maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance statistically indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster across three protein engineering tasks.

Conclusion: g-DPO provides an effective scalable solution for DPO in protein engineering, with greater speed gains expected for larger datasets.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep neural networks grow larger and deployment environments impose strict resource constraints, memory-efficient training becomes increasingly important.

Method: TraDy leverages two insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, and dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation. It uses a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.

Conclusion: TraDy provides an effective transfer learning scheme for memory-efficient training of deep neural networks through dynamic channel selection.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict

*Xin Nie,Liang Dong,HaiCheng Zhang,JiaWang Xiao,G. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ is an efficient quantization framework for deploying LLMs on CPU-based edge devices, using Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) to reduce memory usage and latency while eliminating dequantization overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable LLM deployment on CPU-based edge devices with limited memory and computational resources, addressing bottlenecks in memory usage and latency during edge inference.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) format that captures weight statistics without increasing computational cost, eliminates dequantization overhead, and integrates with existing quantization pipelines. Provides optimized CPU kernels for end-to-end inference.

Result: For LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces perplexity by ~8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under PTQ, completes quantization within 1 hour. With finetuning, improves 2-bit performance within 2 hours. 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves >25 tokens/s on Apple M2 chip.

Conclusion: ELUTQ effectively addresses edge deployment challenges through HLQ, achieving significant performance improvements and efficiency gains for low-bit quantization of LLMs on CPU-based devices.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff framework uses synthetic ICU data for trustworthy model evaluation, reducing real-on-synthetic vs real-on-real performance gap by 70% while improving subgroup-level evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rigorous and trustworthy evaluation of predictive models in critical care across population and demographic subgroups without exposing sensitive EHR data.

Method: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff augments latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties, building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators, and benchmarks on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets.

Result: Reduces TRTS gap by over 70% (Δ_TRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC), preserves training utility (Δ_TSTR ≈ 0.01), and cuts subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50% relative to small real test sets.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust performance analysis across diverse patient populations.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikeQuant enables energy-efficient LLM deployment through mixed-precision quantization that converts activations to binary spikes and embeds quantization scales into spiking neuron thresholds, avoiding MAC operations and dequantization overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in LLM quantization: (1) MAC operations still dominate energy consumption, (2) dequantization introduces extra overhead, and (3) uniform bit-widths clip important values while mixed precision is impractical on current hardware.

Method: Selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values, re-encodes them into binary spike counts for dynamic mixed storage, and embeds quantization scale into IF neuron thresholds to avoid explicit dequantization.

Result: Achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SpikeQuant provides an effective approach for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment by leveraging spiking neural network principles to replace MAC operations with temporal accumulation.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: Diffusion Caching is a training-free, architecture-agnostic method that reduces computational overhead in diffusion models by reusing intrinsic computational redundancies through feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from high computational overhead and generation latency due to multi-step iterations and complex backbone networks, creating bottlenecks for real-time applications. Existing acceleration techniques face limitations in applicability, training costs, or quality degradation.

Method: Identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process through feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling without modifying model parameters. The approach evolves from static reuse to dynamic prediction.

Result: Enables efficient inference by reducing computation while maintaining quality. The method is compatible with other acceleration techniques like sampling optimization and model distillation.

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching represents a key enabler for real-time and efficient generative AI, forming a unified inference framework that will benefit future multimodal and interactive applications in both theory and practice of Efficient Generative Intelligence.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

TL;DR: Multi-model consistency (consortium consistency) outperforms single-model consistency for LLM hallucination detection and mitigation, with reduced inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-model consistency methods have limitations due to imperfect training data (biases, under-representation), and extending to multiple LLMs with different training data, schemes, and architectures can provide better hallucination detection.

Method: Extend single-model consistency to combine responses from multiple LLMs (consortium consistency), evaluating across 15 LLMs and exploring optimal teaming conditions.

Result: Substantial improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond single-model consistency, often with reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: Consortium consistency is an effective approach for enhancing LLM hallucination detection and mitigation while addressing inference cost concerns.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision language models as semantic world models instead of pixel-based reconstruction, framing world modeling as visual question answering about future semantic information to improve robotic planning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional world models that predict future pixels often misalign with planning objectives - good pixel reconstruction doesn't guarantee good planning decisions. The authors want to focus on task-relevant semantic information rather than pixel-level details.

Method: Frame world modeling as visual question answering about semantic information in future frames. Train vision language models as semantic world models through supervised finetuning on image-action-text data, inheriting generalization properties from pretrained models.

Result: The semantic world model enables policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks and shows significant generalization improvements over traditional reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling approaches.

Conclusion: Vision language models can effectively serve as semantic world models for robotic planning, providing better alignment with planning objectives and improved generalization compared to pixel-based reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

TL;DR: Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) addresses prediction-decision misalignment and bias-variance tradeoff in marketing optimization by jointly leveraging observational and experimental data through bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage ML-OR pipelines suffer from prediction-decision misalignment (ML focuses on accuracy not optimization) and bias-variance dilemma (observational data is biased, experimental data is scarce).

Method: Develops unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using experimental data, establishes bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages both data types via implicit differentiation, and uses surrogate loss functions to bridge discrete optimization gradients.

Result: Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial datasets, and large-scale online A/B tests show statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Deployed at Meituan, one of the world's largest food delivery platforms.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL effectively addresses fundamental challenges in marketing optimization by aligning prediction with decision objectives and achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff through joint data utilization.

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling have practical limitations in controlling linear systems with quadratic cost under unknown dynamics.

Method: Developed MED-LQ by leveraging LQR policy structure, sensitivity analysis, and stability analysis to extend Confusing Instance principle and Minimum Empirical Divergence algorithms beyond small-scale settings.

Result: Benchmarks on comprehensive control suite show MED-LQ achieves competitive performance across various scenarios.

Conclusion: MED-LQ demonstrates potential for broader applications in large-scale Markov Decision Processes by successfully extending CI and MED principles to control problems.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

*Jinpyo Hong,Rachel E. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastNet-XCL is a deep learning ensemble model combining XGBoost, CNN, and BiLSTM that creates accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks ahead using climate and temporal data without real-time RSV surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ML models showed value for COVID-19 forecasting, their application to endemic diseases like RSV remains underexplored, creating a need for reliable outbreak forecasting tools for effective public health responses.

Method: The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing, using an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations and stochastic inference for probabilistic intervals.

Result: Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, maintaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool suitable for addressing escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

*Jin Han,Zhe Zheng,Yi Gu,Jia-Rui Lin,Xin-Zheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEvac uses generative diffusion models to rapidly simulate building evacuation patterns, achieving 16x speedup over traditional methods while improving simulation quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evacuation simulation requires complex modeling with many parameters, making it unsuitable for rapid iteration in early design stages. There's a need for faster, more efficient methods.

Method: Created dataset of 399 building layouts and evacuation heatmaps, used decoupled feature representation for physical features, and trained diffusion model with image prompts to learn evacuation patterns.

Result: Achieved 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and 16x faster simulation time (2 minutes vs traditional methods). Outperformed Conditional GANs with RGB representation.

Conclusion: DiffEvac enables rapid design iteration, lowers modeling burden, facilitates large-scale what-if exploration, and provides new technical pathways for intelligent building safety optimization.

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that least squares can be transformed into a differentiable operator for diverse ML applications beyond linear model fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock the unfulfilled potential of least squares in modern machine learning by making it a differentiable operator.

Method: Derive custom gradients to transform least squares solvers into differentiable operators, treating them like neural network layers.

Result: Successfully applied to: (i) enforcing weight sparsity in 50M parameter models, (ii) imposing conservativeness in score-based generative models, and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes.

Conclusion: This work advances differentiable linear-algebra tools and makes them accessible to ML practitioners.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

*Shashi Kumar,Yacouba Kaloga,John Mitros,Petr Motlicek,Ina Kodrasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FVAE-LoRA improves standard LoRA by using a VAE to learn two factorized latent spaces - one for task-salient features and another for residual information, leading to better performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace, potentially limiting downstream performance.

Method: Propose Factorized Variational Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA) which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct latent spaces with a novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation that explicitly promotes factorization between them.

Result: Extensive experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Spurious correlation evaluations confirm better isolation of task-relevant signals and improved robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA effectively factorizes latent spaces to isolate task-salient features, leading to superior performance and robustness compared to standard LoRA across multiple domains.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

### [172] [Overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for treatment effect estimation over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19643)
*Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Mihaela van der Schaar,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in time-varying settings that addresses severe overlap problems by targeting high-probability treatment sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learners for time-varying HTE estimation suffer from exploding variance when treatment overlap is low, as the probability of observing certain treatment sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons.

Method: Developed a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes overlap-weighted oracle risk, creating a model-agnostic meta-learner that targets regions with high probability of receiving interventional treatment sequences.

Result: The WO-learner demonstrates robustness against nuisance function misspecification and provides more reliable HTE estimates compared to existing methods, as shown through experiments with transformer and LSTM backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner effectively addresses overlap problems in time-varying HTE estimation, offering a fully data-driven approach that counteracts instabilities in existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

### [173] [Policy Learning with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672)
*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy learning with abstention allows deferring to safe defaults when uncertain, achieving fast O(1/n) regret with known propensities and extending to unknown propensities via doubly robust methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most policy learning methods force decisions even when uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes settings like personalized medicine and advertising. Abstention provides a safer alternative.

Method: Two-stage learner: first identifies near-optimal policies, then constructs abstention rule from their disagreements. Uses doubly robust objective for unknown propensities.

Result: Establishes fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees with known propensities, extends to unknown propensities. Abstention improves guarantees under margin conditions without realizability assumption.

Conclusion: Abstention is a versatile tool that enables safe policy learning, connects to distributionally robust learning, and supports safe policy improvement over baselines with high probability.

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSD introduces hierarchical speculative decoding that stacks multiple draft models in a hierarchy to reduce transformer inference latency, achieving up to 1.2x speed-up over single-draft baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer inference latency scales with token count, and while speculative decoding helps, existing approaches use single draft models without leveraging the full spectrum of available draft models with varying speed-accuracy tradeoffs.

Method: HSD stacks multiple draft models hierarchically where each model proposes tokens and the next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, with the target model as the final verifier. The algorithm includes polynomial-time optimization for selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy.

Result: HSD provides up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline, demonstrating practical latency reduction beyond previous speculative decoding techniques.

Conclusion: Hierarchical speculative decoding effectively reduces transformer generation latency by leveraging multiple draft models in an optimized hierarchy, offering significant speed improvements over single-draft approaches.

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO is a lightweight foundation model for time series forecasting that achieves strong generalization with reduced pre-training data and model size through energy-aware spectral decomposition and mixture-of-prompts transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tension between versatility and affordability in time series foundation models - current models require massive architectures and large-scale pre-training, hindering deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Two key modules: 1) Energy-aware spectral decomposition that models both high-energy and low-energy frequency signals for better data utilization; 2) Mixture-of-Prompts enabled Transformer that learns heterogeneous patterns through dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes tokens to prompt-based experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 datasets across two benchmarks show superior performance in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing pre-training data scale and model size.

Conclusion: SEMPO demonstrates that lightweight foundation models can achieve strong generalization in time series forecasting with reduced computational requirements, making them more deployable in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

*Bhavya Agrawalla,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for online least-squares SGD, enabling Gaussian CLT in growing-dimensional regime with improved computational efficiency over covariance-inversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying SGD in high-stakes applications requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, but existing high-dimensional inference methods are computationally expensive and restrictive in dimensional scaling.

Method: Established non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, developed online variance estimator for asymptotic variance, and established high-probability deviation bounds.

Result: CLT holds for SGD iterates when t ≳ d^(1+δ) for any δ > 0, significantly extending dimensional regime. Online SGD operates in O(td) time with O(d) memory, vs O(td² + d³) of covariance-inversion methods.

Conclusion: First fully online and data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in near-optimal scaling regime t ≳ d^(1+δ).

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

TL;DR: BATIS is a Bayesian deep learning framework that improves species distribution models by iteratively updating prior predictions with limited observational data, addressing spatial biases and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning SDMs perform well on complex datasets but are limited by spatial data biases. There's a need to effectively combine local insights with broader ecological patterns while capturing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Introduces BATIS - a Bayesian framework where prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Benchmarks extensive uncertainty quantification approaches on eBird citizen science data.

Result: Bayesian deep learning approaches greatly improve SDM reliability in data-scarce locations, enabling better ecological understanding and conservation efforts.

Conclusion: The BATIS framework demonstrates how Bayesian deep learning can enhance species distribution modeling by effectively handling spatial biases and uncertainty, particularly valuable for data-limited conservation scenarios.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

### [178] [When Do Transformers Learn Heuristics for Graph Connectivity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19753)
*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms and instead rely on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a test case, the paper shows that transformers can only solve graphs with diameters up to 3^L (where L is the number of layers), implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why transformers fail to learn generalizable algorithms and instead rely on brittle heuristics, using graph connectivity as a concrete testbed to analyze this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically.

Method: Analyzed a simplified Transformer architecture (disentangled Transformer) and proved that an L-layer model can solve graphs with diameters up to exactly 3^L. Studied training dynamics and showed that learned strategies depend on whether training instances are within model capacity.

Result: Within-capacity graphs (diameter ≤ 3^L) lead to learning correct algorithmic solutions, while beyond-capacity graphs lead to learning simple heuristics based on node degrees. Empirically demonstrated that restricting training data within model capacity helps both standard and disentangled transformers learn the exact algorithm.

Conclusion: The capacity limitations of transformers determine whether they learn generalizable algorithms or simple heuristics. Training with data within model capacity enables learning of correct algorithmic solutions rather than brittle heuristics.

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX is a novel method that generates uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to provide local coverage guarantees and avoid regions of high predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods often neglect predictive uncertainty or lack principled mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees, which can lead to misleading or inapplicable explanations in uncertain regions.

Method: CONFEX combines Conformal Prediction (CP) with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), using a novel localized CP procedure that leverages an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space for efficient MILP encoding.

Result: CONFEX generates counterfactual explanations with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty and optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks and metrics.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-aware approach of CONFEX yields robust and plausible counterfactual explanations with formal guarantees, addressing the limitations of existing methods that ignore predictive uncertainty.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

*Euodia Dodd,Nataša Krčo,Igor Shilov,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method to estimate model vulnerability to membership inference attacks without requiring computationally expensive reference models, by analyzing loss distribution asymmetry and using the absence of high-loss outliers as a predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art membership inference attacks require training numerous reference models which are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for evaluating privacy risks.

Method: Leverages insights about asymmetric and heavy-tailed loss distributions, using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as a predictor of risk. Estimates model-level vulnerability from training and testing distributions alone using the TNR of a simple loss attack.

Result: The method accurately estimates model-level vulnerability to SOTA MIA attack (LiRA) across various architectures and datasets, outperforms low-cost attacks like RMIA and other distribution difference measures, and shows promise for evaluating risk in large-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective and computationally efficient alternative to reference model-based methods for assessing membership inference attack vulnerability, with potential applications to large language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

### [181] [GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19778)
*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a sparse fine-tuning technique that selectively tunes parameters with large gradient magnitudes and small pre-trained weights, improving performance while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse fine-tuning methods for LLMs lack optimal parameter selection, which affects adaptation effectiveness and can disrupt pre-trained knowledge.

Method: Fine-tunes only parameters with largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and smallest pre-trained magnitudes, prioritizing task-relevant but minimally disruptive parameters.

Result: Outperforms or matches LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT on LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B models, improves generalization, reduces catastrophic forgetting and task data memorization.

Conclusion: GaLLoP provides stable, robust fine-tuning that preserves pre-trained knowledge while effectively adapting to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Haotian Wang,Wenjing Yang,Yunfei Wang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaInfer is a novel method that infers environment specifications from prediction errors without requiring environment labels during training, addressing limitations of existing generalization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven methods for dynamical systems assume I.I.D. data and require environment labels, which are often unavailable due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability.

Method: DynaInfer analyzes prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round to infer environment specifications, enabling environment assignments directly from data without labels.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems show DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and achieves superior performance even when environment labels are available.

Conclusion: DynaInfer effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and provides a practical solution for handling environmental differences in data-driven dynamical system analysis without requiring environment labels.

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to detect if someone is using a derivative of Alice's language model by testing for statistical dependencies between Bob's model/text and the randomized training order of Alice's model, using palimpsestic memorization as evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable model creators to prove when others are using derivatives of their models, either through direct queries or by analyzing generated text alone, addressing intellectual property concerns in open-weight models.

Method: Formulates the problem as independence testing using palimpsestic memorization. In query setting: prompts Bob's model to estimate likelihoods of training examples and correlates with training order. In observational setting: uses text overlap with training data or likelihoods from retrained model variants.

Result: Query setting achieves p-values ≤1e-8 for most fine-tunes. Observational setting can detect usage from few hundred tokens using retraining approach, or several hundred thousand tokens using text overlap method.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical framework provides quantifiable evidence for detecting model derivatives, with query-based detection being highly effective and observational detection feasible with sufficient text samples.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical analysis showing that transformers can function as near-optimal metalearners in linear classification tasks, requiring significantly fewer in-context examples than standard learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze whether transformers can serve as metalearners that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples, without further training, in a formal metalearning setting.

Method: Analyzed a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent on a family of linear classification tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional Gaussian mixture model with mean vectors in a shared k-dimensional subspace.

Result: After sufficient training, the transformer can generalize to new tasks using only O(k/R^4) in-context examples, nearly matching optimal learner performance and significantly outperforming standard learners that require Ω(d/R^4) examples.

Conclusion: Transformers can indeed function as effective metalearners, achieving near-optimal performance with dimension-independent training requirements and substantially reducing the number of in-context examples needed for generalization.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico under hardware, energy, and fiscal constraints, finding that H100-based configurations are more cost-effective than A100 alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural asymmetries in AI development between high-capacity jurisdictions and Global South countries by examining technical and fiscal viability of local language model training.

Method: Used a dual-axis design varying accelerator generation (H100 vs A100) and training duration (90 vs 150 days) to estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility for training a 10-trillion-token model.

Result: All configurations remained below export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds. H100-based scenarios achieved training feasibility at 8-14 million USD total cost, while A100 deployments required 19-32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demands.

Conclusion: Extending training timelines should be used as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models without competing at the global frontier, contributing to sustainable AI capabilities in middle-income countries.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

TL;DR: TinyUSFM is a lightweight ultrasound foundation model that achieves computational efficiency while maintaining performance through knowledge distillation with curated datasets and domain-separated masked image modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large medical imaging foundation models require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. There's a need for lightweight models that maintain performance while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: TinyUSFM successfully demonstrates that lightweight foundation models can maintain superior performance while being computationally efficient, enabling deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings without sacrificing organ versatility and task adaptability.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging demonstrate superior generalization
capabilities across diverse anatomical structures and clinical applications.
Their outstanding performance relies on substantial computational resources,
limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. This paper
presents TinyUSFM, the first lightweight ultrasound foundation model that
maintains superior organ versatility and task adaptability of our large-scale
Ultrasound Foundation Model (USFM) through knowledge distillation with
strategically curated small datasets, delivering significant computational
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Considering the limited capacity
and representation ability of lightweight models, we propose a feature-gradient
driven coreset selection strategy to curate high-quality compact training data,
avoiding training degradation from low-quality redundant images. To preserve
the essential spatial and frequency domain characteristics during knowledge
transfer, we develop domain-separated masked image modeling assisted
consistency-driven dynamic distillation. This novel framework adaptively
transfers knowledge from large foundation models by leveraging teacher model
consistency across different domain masks, specifically tailored for ultrasound
interpretation. For evaluation, we establish the UniUS-Bench, the largest
publicly available ultrasound benchmark comprising 8 classification and 10
segmentation datasets across 15 organs. Using only 200K images in distillation,
TinyUSFM matches USFM's performance with just 6.36% of parameters and 6.40% of
GFLOPs. TinyUSFM significantly outperforms the vanilla model by 9.45% in
classification and 7.72% in segmentation, surpassing all state-of-the-art
lightweight models, and achieving 84.91% average classification accuracy and
85.78% average segmentation Dice score across diverse medical devices and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes test-time scaling with verification in LLMs, framing it as a transport problem to characterize interactions between generator coverage, verifier's region of convergence, and sampling sub-optimality, revealing three distinct regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role of verifiers and their imperfections in test-time scaling remains underexplored, with recent studies only capturing subsets of the key factors (coverage, ROC, sub-optimality) without a unified framework.

Method: Framed verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem to characterize the geometry of interactions between coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality. Proposed and analyzed sequential and batched sampling algorithms, examining their computational complexities.

Result: Identified three regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve: transport regime (sub-optimality increases with coverage), policy improvement regime (sub-optimality may decrease depending on verifier's ROC), and saturation regime (sub-optimality plateaus). Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models support theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The transport framework provides a unified understanding of verifiable test-time scaling, revealing how computational complexity of sampling algorithms shapes the trade-offs between coverage, verifier performance, and sub-optimality.

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED integrates Bayesian Experimental Design with LLMs to optimize clinical test selection, reducing diagnostic uncertainty while maintaining clinician oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for clinical diagnosis fail to capture sequential, resource-aware reasoning used by clinicians, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings.

Method: Combines Bayesian Experimental Design with large language models to select tests that maximize reduction in diagnostic uncertainty, using LLMs as flexible simulators for patient state distributions.

Result: ACTMED optimizes test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework represents progress toward transparent, adaptive diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced domain-specific data requirements.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM is a method to mitigate reward hacking in preference-based reward models by learning group-invariant kernels to reduce dependency on spurious features like verbosity and sycophancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based reward models in RLHF are prone to reward hacking and poor generalization due to over-optimization, exploiting shortcuts like response verbosity and agreeable tone rather than genuine human preferences.

Method: Proposed PRISM (Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps using a closed-form learning objective inspired by invariant theory in kernel perspective.

Result: Experimental results show PRISM consistently improves reward model accuracy on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces shortcut dependency in downstream policy models.

Conclusion: PRISM establishes a robust framework for preference-based alignment by effectively mitigating shortcut behaviors in reward learning.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Conclusion: MUSE Benchmark provides critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving development of more robust AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mode Selection is identified as a more challenging variant of Early Exit for reasoning models, requiring decisions at the beginning of reasoning using zero-step thinking rather than during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead caused by overthinking in reasoning models while maintaining performance in tasks like mathematics and logical reasoning.

Method: Proposes Mode Selection as an alternative to Early Exit, using zero-step thinking to decide between Long-CoT or Short-CoT modes at the beginning of reasoning rather than during inference.

Result: Prompt-based approaches fail due to limited classification capabilities, while internal information approaches perform better but lack stability. Existing methods are insufficient for effective Mode Selection with limited information.

Conclusion: Mode Selection presents ongoing challenges as existing methods relying solely on model information are inadequate, highlighting the difficulty of making optimal reasoning decisions without explicit reasoning processes.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

Motivation: Current web agent evaluation uses binary success metrics or single reference trajectories, ignoring the structural diversity in benchmark datasets.

Method: Abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into unified weighted action graphs, canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics.

Result: Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics.

Conclusion: By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

### [195] [ChatGPT Unveils Its Limits: Principles of Law Deliver Checkmate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19261)
*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatGPT's performance in legal domain shows limitations in assembling knowledge and reasoning comprehensively, unlike human intelligence which can break down complex issues and provide unified solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities in legal tasks, specifically extracting principles of law from legal decisions, and compare it with regex-based methods rather than just human performance.

Method: Conducted experiments comparing ChatGPT's performance against regex baselines in extracting key legal passages and principles of law from legal documents.

Result: ChatGPT fails to assemble necessary knowledge and reason comprehensively to produce exhaustive results in legal tasks, revealing significant limitations in complex reasoning.

Conclusion: Genuine intelligence that can break down complex issues and provide comprehensive solutions remains uniquely human in the legal domain, as AI lacks all-encompassing understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

### [196] [An Argumentative Explanation Framework for Generalized Reason Model with Inconsistent Precedents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19263)
*Wachara Fungwacharakorn,Gauvain Bourgne,Ken Satoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to provide argumentative explanations for reasoning with inconsistent precedents in the generalized reason model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional precedent-based reasoning assumes consistent precedents, but real-world legal cases often involve inconsistent precedents. The generalized reason model accommodates this, but lacks corresponding argumentative explanation methods.

Method: The authors extend the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to handle reasoning with inconsistent precedents according to the generalized reason model.

Result: The paper develops an argumentative explanation framework that can explain reasoning processes even when dealing with inconsistent precedents.

Conclusion: The extended DSA-framework successfully provides argumentative explanations for precedent-based reasoning with inconsistent precedents, addressing a gap in existing explanation methods.

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

*Philipp J. Schneider,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents can reproduce complex human social dynamics like homophily and reciprocity through behavioral reward functions and in-context learning with coaching signals, forming network structures similar to real online communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLM agents can replicate complex human social dynamics and what mechanisms enable such dynamics to emerge, particularly in online behavior contexts.

Method: Multi-agent LLM simulation framework with repeated interactions, mutual evaluation, and behavior adaptation through in-context learning accelerated by coaching signals. Designed behavioral reward functions capturing core drivers of online engagement.

Result: Coached LLM agents developed stable interaction patterns and formed emergent social ties, creating network structures that mirror properties of real online communities.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

*Jinwu Hu,Zihao Lian,Zhiquan Wen,Chenghao Li,Guohao Chen,Xutao Wen,Bin Xiao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CKA-RL is a Continual Reinforcement Learning method that uses task-specific knowledge vectors and adaptive merging to prevent catastrophic forgetting and enable efficient knowledge transfer across non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are non-stationary, requiring continuous adaptation. Existing Continual RL methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization when learning across multiple tasks.

Method: Proposes Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy with task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamic historical knowledge usage. Includes Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism to combine similar vectors for scalability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks with 4.20% overall performance improvement and 8.02% forward transfer improvement.

Conclusion: CKA-RL effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer in continual reinforcement learning through knowledge preservation and adaptation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating multi-hop tool orchestration by LLM agents, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by using equal function sets and systematic testing across five difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges like functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments of agent capabilities.

Method: Constructs ground truth through 'equal function sets' and organizes testing as a five-level curriculum from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning and robustness testing.

Result: Experiments show rigid hierarchies hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness.

Conclusion: MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose limitations and guide development of more capable tool-using agents, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr is a neurosymbolic proceduralization framework that compiles symbolic plans into composable procedures for LM-based agents, enabling efficient embodied reasoning without external symbolic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address latency, connectivity, and resource constraints in dynamic environments where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is limited.

Method: Generate task-specific plans with symbolic tools, transform them into composable procedural representations encoding implicit production rules, and integrate these procedures into LM inference.

Result: Outperforms large-scale reasoning models and symbolic planners on embodied benchmarks (PDDLGym, VirtualHome, ALFWorld) while using more compact LMs.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic proceduralization enables efficient test-time inference for embodied agents in resource-constrained systems, abstracting multi-step reasoning into single-step LM inference.

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

*Runpeng Xie,Quanwei Wang,Hao Hu,Zherui Zhou,Ni Mu,Xiyun Li,Yiqin Yang,Shuang Xu,Qianchuan Zhao,Bo XU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL is a novel method that addresses ambiguity in language-conditioned tasks through distributional policy and semantic alignment, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language instructions are flexible but induce substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, which severely degrades algorithmic performance in intelligent agents.

Method: DAIL features two key components: distributional policy (enhances task differentiability through value distribution estimation) and semantic alignment (captures correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions).

Result: Extensive experiments on structured and visual observation benchmarks show DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities and achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DAIL successfully addresses the ambiguity problem in language-conditioned tasks through its distributional aligned learning approach, demonstrating improved performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp is a new benchmark for evaluating deep search agents on hierarchical rule application, specifically for predicting 10-digit Harmonized System Codes from noisy product descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks overlook the critical capability of applying complex rules with vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, which is essential for real-world applications like legal, medical, and tariff rule systems.

Method: Built from real-world e-commerce data with 632 product entries spanning diverse categories, annotated by human experts. The benchmark evaluates agents' ability to navigate hierarchical rules to predict HSCodes.

Result: Best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Test-time scaling fails to improve performance, highlighting the challenge of hierarchical rule application.

Conclusion: There is a significant performance gap between current agents and human experts in hierarchical rule application, indicating this as a critical area for future agent development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense is a hybrid framework that integrates LLMs into participatory urban sensing using multi-agent evolution to adapt sensing tasks to dynamic urban conditions and worker preferences while providing natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban sensing systems have limited generalization across diverse scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making, hindering their effectiveness in modern urban management.

Method: Uses a training-free framework with large language models in a multi-agent evolution system: classical planner generates baseline solutions, then iteratively refines them to adapt to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show AgentSense outperforms traditional methods in adaptivity and explainability, and beats single-agent LLM baselines in performance, robustness, and explanation quality.

Conclusion: AgentSense represents a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based engine for generating chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students, using weighted graphs to find optimal transitions between chord arpeggios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chord tone soloing is fundamental for jazz guitar improvisation but difficult to learn and practice, requiring a systematic approach to help students master this essential skill.

Method: Generate chord-tone arpeggios, construct weighted graph with nodes representing chord arpeggios, calculate edge weights based on optimal transition tones, find shortest path through graph, and reconstruct soloing lines.

Result: Developed a computational engine that can generate chord tone soloing suggestions by finding optimal paths through chord progression graphs.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach provides a systematic method for generating chord tone soloing lines, with a user-friendly system designed to help guitar students practice this fundamental improvisation technique.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

TL;DR: This paper presents an explainable win prediction system for e-sports that uses streaming data with sliding windows to track game changes, achieving over 90% accuracy and outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of e-sports and online gaming industry, combined with limitations in current AI solutions that focus mainly on batch classification without proper visualization and explainability.

Method: An explainable win prediction classification solution using streaming data with multiple sliding windows to capture relevant game changes in real-time.

Result: Achieved accuracy higher than 90%, surpassing competing solutions in the literature.

Conclusion: The system can be used by ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, with the explainability module building trust in prediction outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn weighted rules through generation, logistic regression, refinement, and evaluation stages, showing that direct rule application outperforms LLM prompting for probabilistic integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLM-based rule learning approaches that ignore rule interactions and underexplore probabilistic inference, creating a unified framework for robust neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) LLM generates and filters rule candidates, (2) logistic regression learns probabilistic weights, (3) iterative refinement updates rules using prediction errors, (4) evaluation compares direct rule application vs LLM prompting.

Result: Direct application of weighted rules yields superior performance, while prompting LLMs with rules, weights, and logistic outputs degrades accuracy, showing LLMs excel at semantic tasks but struggle with precise probabilistic integration.

Conclusion: RLIE clarifies LLMs' potential and limitations for inductive reasoning, demonstrating that coupling them with classic probabilistic methods enables more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo is a transformer-based architecture for RL that creates and retrieves memories through periodic summarization tokens, enabling efficient handling of long-horizon tasks while outperforming naive long-context transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based policies for embodied agents struggle with visual input overload and context limits, while humans effectively compress lifetime experiences into memories. Existing approaches use either fixed-size recurrent memory or full-context transformers, lacking efficient memory compression.

Method: Memo uses a transformer architecture with interleaved periodic summarization tokens during training to create and retrieve memories. This enables memory formation and access for long-horizon RL tasks.

Result: Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines on gridworld meta-RL and multi-object navigation tasks, while being more compute and storage efficient. It also generalizes better to longer contexts and remains robust in streaming settings with truncated history.

Conclusion: Memo successfully addresses the memory compression challenge in embodied agents by incorporating memory creation and retrieval mechanisms, enabling efficient operation over extended timeframes while maintaining performance and robustness.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PROBE is a new benchmark for evaluating proactive LLM agents that decomposes proactivity into three capabilities: searching for unspecified issues, identifying bottlenecks, and executing resolutions. Current state-of-the-art models struggle with this benchmark, with best performance reaching only 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating proactive LLM agents are limited to localized context and cannot test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons, creating a gap in comprehensive proactivity evaluation.

Method: PROBE decomposes proactivity into a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. This framework is applied to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks.

Result: Even state-of-the-art models struggle with the PROBE benchmark, with the best end-to-end performance of 40% achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. The study provides consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, analyzing their relative capabilities and mutual failure modes.

Conclusion: The results highlight current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems and expose promising future research directions for improving proactive capabilities in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world model evaluation methods are limited by being anchored to next-frame prediction and same-environment reward maximization, which doesn't reflect the goal of learning models that support diverse downstream tasks.

Method: WorldTest protocol with reward-free exploration phase followed by scored test phase in different but related environments, using AutumnBench suite with tasks for masked-frame prediction, planning, and causal dynamics change prediction.

Result: Humans outperformed frontier AI models on AutumnBench, and scaling compute only improved performance in some environments but not others, showing significant headroom in world-model learning.

Conclusion: WorldTest provides a novel evaluation template that better assesses what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench reveals substantial gaps between human and current AI world-model learning capabilities.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
