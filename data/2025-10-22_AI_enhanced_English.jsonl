These jammers can generate a multitude of\ndeceptive false targets, overwhelming the radar's processing capabilities and\nmasking targets. Consequently, the ability to robustly discriminate between\ntrue targets and complex jamming signals, especially in low signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) environments, is of importance. This paper introduces the\nattention-based dual-tree wavelet scattering prototypical network (AWSPNet), a\ndeep learning framework designed for simultaneous radar target recognition and\njamming suppression. The core of AWSPNet is the encoder that leverages the\ndual-tree complex wavelet transform to extract features that are inherently\nrobust to noise and signal translations. These features are further refined by\nan attention mechanism and a pre-trained backbone network. To address the\nchallenge of limited labeled data and enhance generalization, we employ a\nsupervised contrastive learning strategy during the training phase.

At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized\ndecision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,\nand a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically\nadjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.\nUnder the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target\ndetection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both\nenergy and mobility constraints.

As scanning the entire directional\nspace is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the\noptimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms\nrequire a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing\nworks propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on\nunimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.\nHowever, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)\nin practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal\nbeams.\n  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms\n\\textit{pretc} and \\textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property\nof mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to\nthe Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each\npath as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled\nhistorical rewards. \\textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and\nthen commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.\n\\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the\nbest beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to\nbeam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the\nsynthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we\ndemonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range\nof scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their\ngeneralizability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes two physics-informed bandit algorithms (pretc and prgreedy) for mmWave beam alignment that exploit sparse multipath properties instead of unimodality assumptions, showing superior performance across diverse channel environments.", "motivation": "Traditional bandit algorithms for beam alignment rely on unimodality/multimodality assumptions that often don't hold in practice, causing convergence to suboptimal beams.

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process.
