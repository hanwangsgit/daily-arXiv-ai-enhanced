Optimization is efficiently performed via a\nhybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based\nrefinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,\nphysical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations\nconducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,\nwhile practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin\nmanipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.\nProject page: https://xiahongchi.github.io/HoloScene.", "AI": {"tldr": "HoloScene is an interactive 3D reconstruction framework that creates simulation-ready virtual environments with complete geometry, physical plausibility, and photorealistic rendering by optimizing scene-graph representations.", "motivation": "Current 3D reconstruction methods lack completeness in geometry, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties needed for reliable dynamic simulation.", "method": "Uses an interactive scene-graph representation encoding geometry, appearance, and physical properties with hierarchical relationships.

Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting\ndetailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines\nimage embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and\ncategorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level\noptimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture\nparameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing\nsparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on\nthe BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%\naccuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by\napproximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively.

While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the\nnumber of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong\nperformance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved\nresults stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest\n(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap\nbetween users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on\nthe variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more\nfine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of\nindependent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper establishes high-probability convergence guarantees for Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD) under the same conditions needed for mean-squared error convergence, removing restrictive assumptions like uniformly bounded gradients and achieving order-optimal rates with linear speed-up.", "motivation": "There is a significant gap between assumptions used for high-probability convergence and mean-squared error convergence in decentralized settings, unlike centralized settings where SGD converges under the same conditions.
