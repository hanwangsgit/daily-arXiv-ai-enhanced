We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to\nevaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show\nthat we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps\nand accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not\nonly extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when\nobservations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our\nunderstanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning to convert 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps for tropical cyclones, enabling global 3D cloud reconstruction even when observations are missing.", "motivation": "Accurate tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification.", "method": "Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties, applied to a custom-built TC dataset.", "result": "First-time creation of global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurate reconstruction of 3D structure of intense storms, extending available satellite observations and providing estimates when observations are missing.", "conclusion": "This framework is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure information."}}
