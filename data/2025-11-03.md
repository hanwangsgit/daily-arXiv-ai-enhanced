### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' ability to read measurement instruments, showing that even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with precise measurement reading due to difficulties in indicator localization and spatial grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models find it surprisingly challenging to read measurement instruments, which is effortless for humans and requires little domain expertise, highlighting a gap in fine-grained spatial perception capabilities.

Method: Created MeasureBench with real-world and synthesized measurement images, along with an extensible pipeline for procedural generation of gauges with controllable visual appearance (pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, clutter). Also conducted reinforcement learning experiments on synthetic data.

Result: Evaluation shows that even the strongest VLMs struggle with measurement reading, with consistent failure in indicator localization - models can read digits but misidentify pointer positions, leading to large numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning. RL experiments showed encouraging results on synthetic data but less promising for real-world images.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fundamental limitations in fine-grained spatial grounding. The benchmark aims to help advance visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception in VLMs, bridging the gap between number recognition and actual measurement capabilities.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework for multi-institutional QCT that addresses domain shift using adversarial and statistical alignment to enable scanner-agnostic proximal femur segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks trained on one QCT dataset often fail when applied to another due to domain shift from varying scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics, which hinders multi-center osteoporosis research and reliable quantitative metrics.

Method: Developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework with 3D TransUNet backbone, integrating adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) to discourage site-specific encoding and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to reduce distributional mismatches between institutions.

Result: Trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture research cohorts with 1,024 QCT images from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for proximal femur segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual alignment mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail for reliable multi-institutional QCT analysis.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing primitive count by up to 30% while improving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Adaptive Density Control (ADC) uses only positional gradient magnitudes for primitive splitting, which can lead to redundant splitting and suboptimal alignment with local structures.

Method: Incorporates Directional Consistency (DC) through angular coherence of gradients to better capture local structural complexities, and uses DC to define optimal split positions for sub-primitives.

Result: Reduces number of primitives by up to 30% compared to existing ADC methods while greatly enhancing reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: DC4GS effectively reduces primitive redundancy and improves structural alignment in 3D Gaussian Splatting through directional consistency-based adaptive density control.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

### [4] [Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26923)
*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SACL is a dynamic curriculum learning method that adapts to data scale variations, showing significant performance gains in data-scarce scenarios for lung nodule detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with limited annotated data in clinical settings, and traditional static curriculum learning fails in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Proposes Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) with three mechanisms: adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization, evaluated on LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11.

Result: SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum on full dataset, but shows 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL enables robust training across varying data scales without architectural modifications, providing a practical solution for healthcare institutions with limited annotation resources.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

### [5] [SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961)
*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework for automated brain lesion segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple pathologies through hybrid architecture and variance reduction training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for brain lesion segmentation are specialized point solutions with poor generalization and high performance variance, limiting clinical reliability.

Method: Hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion, hierarchical gated decoder, trained with pathology-specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art DSC of 0.831 (HD95: 3.03) on WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy on ISLES 2022 (HD95: 9.69), and highest DSC for tumor core (0.8651) on BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: The unified adaptive framework provides robust and clinically feasible solution for automated brain lesion segmentation across multiple pathologies.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAT model for live video comment generation that prioritizes semantically relevant frames using CLIP and weighted aggregation, plus a new English Twitch dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook prioritizing video frames relevant to viewer interactions, which is crucial for generating contextually appropriate comments in live video streams.

Method: Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) that uses CLIP for visual-text knowledge, assigns weights to frames based on semantic relevance to conversations, employs weighted sum of frames, and uses cross-attention for multimodal context.

Result: Created a large English Twitch dataset with 438 hours across 11 categories and 3.2M comments. SFAT outperforms existing methods in generating contextually appropriate comments.

Conclusion: SFAT effectively addresses frame prioritization for live comment generation and the new dataset enables better research in English-language video comment generation.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework for incremental human-object interaction detection that addresses catastrophic forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOI detection without using exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world environments have continuously evolving human-object interactions that challenge conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge inspires the need for incremental HOI detection in dynamic environments.

Method: IRD framework decouples learning of objects and relations, introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations sharing the same relation. It's exemplar-free and handles interaction drift.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

Conclusion: The proposed IRD framework effectively addresses key challenges in incremental HOI detection including catastrophic forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOI detection without requiring exemplars.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned vision foundation model for autonomous driving semantic segmentation that extends SAM with dual-encoder architecture and deformable decoder, achieving superior performance on Cityscapes and BDD100K benchmarks with improved cross-domain generalization and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes in autonomous driving by enhancing the Segment Anything Model with specialized architecture and optimization techniques for reliable semantic segmentation.

Method: Extends SAM with dual-encoder (combining ViT-H global context with ResNet-50 local detail), deformable fusion module, progressive multi-stage refinement decoder, and hybrid loss (Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, Surface losses) for semantic class balance and boundary precision.

Result: Achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU respectively. Shows strong cross-domain generalization (0.87 retention score), faster convergence (30-40 epochs), and data efficiency (0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception with improved accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT is a hierarchical neural field representation for 3D shapes that learns general hierarchies in an unsupervised, coarse-to-fine manner across different shape categories using a hierarchical transformer with compressed codebooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn general hierarchical structures in 3D shapes across different categories without supervision, overcoming limitations of previous methods that constrained hierarchies to fixed structures like binary trees.

Method: Uses a hierarchical transformer (HiT) with compressed codebooks at each level to learn parent-child relationships, allowing automatic identification of common substructures across diverse shape categories without fixed hierarchical constraints.

Result: Successfully captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes when trained with reconstruction loss, and demonstrates effectiveness through unsupervised shape segmentation across all 55 ShapeNet categories.

Conclusion: HiT provides a flexible approach to infer hierarchical structures directly from data, representing more general and complex hierarchies than prior methods while enabling multi-level granularity segmentation across diverse shape categories.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA is the first zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates subject-specific adaptation by disentangling fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components through adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image reconstruction methods rely on subject-specific models or fine-tuning, limiting scalability and real-world applicability.

Method: Uses adversarial training to decompose fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, isolating subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics.

Conclusion: Represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding by enabling generalization to unseen subjects without additional fMRI data or retraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

### [13] [WildfireX-SLAM: A Large-scale Low-altitude RGB-D Dataset for Wildfire SLAM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27133)
*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new synthetic dataset called WildfireX-SLAM is created for 3D Gaussian splatting-based SLAM in large-scale forest and wildfire environments, addressing the lack of real-world data collection feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based SLAM methods focus on small indoor scenes, but large-scale forest environments have important applications for wildfire response and forest management. Real-world data collection is too costly and infeasible.

Method: Built a pipeline using Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment to collect synthetic aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities from UAVs, with flexible environmental controls.

Result: Created WildfireX-SLAM dataset with 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images covering 16 km² forest area, and conducted benchmark analysis revealing unique challenges for 3DGS-based SLAM in forests.

Conclusion: The dataset enables research on 3DGS-based SLAM for forest environments, highlighting challenges and potential improvements, with the dataset and code being made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT serves as a strong, practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratizing generative AI models by providing efficient training and inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [15] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) for cross-view object geo-localization, addressing limitations in existing methods by enabling better information transfer between views and suppressing edge noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods fail to effectively transfer information between views and don't refine spatial relationship feature maps, leading to erroneous focus on irrelevant edge noise that affects localization performance.

Method: Proposes CVCAM for multiple iterations of cross-view interaction to exchange contextual information, and MHSAM using multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract spatial features. Also introduces a new G2D dataset for Ground-to-Drone localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CVOGL and G2D datasets show the method achieves high localization accuracy and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses cross-view information transfer limitations and edge noise issues, demonstrating superior performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

*Jiacheng Hong,Kunzhen Wu,Mingrui Yu,Yichao Gu,Shengze Xue,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical generative framework for 3D scene generation that enables multi-step associative semantic spatial composition, allowing users to iteratively expand scenes with fine-grained control while maintaining spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-step generation methods struggle to balance scene complexity with minimal user input, while human cognitive processes in scene modeling progress from global to local with semantic association.

Method: Proposes HiGS framework with Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) that dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies, maintaining one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and objects with recursive layout optimization.

Result: HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering controllable and extensible 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: HiGS provides an efficient paradigm for 3D scene generation that mimics human cognitive processes, enabling iterative expansion with user control while automatically completing peripheral areas.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

*Yuanhao Tang,Xuechao Zou,Zhengpei Hu,Junliang Xing,Chengkun Zhang,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net is a novel framework that combines CNN and Mamba pathways for remote sensing image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results through hierarchical fusion and Mixture-of-Experts classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image classification is challenging due to complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics. Existing methods struggle to efficiently integrate CNNs (good for local textures) and Transformers (good for global context) due to Transformers' high computational cost.

Method: Proposes AFM-Net with two pathways: CNN branch for hierarchical visual priors and Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. Uses Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism to progressively aggregate multi-scale features and Mixture-of-Experts classifier for adaptive feature routing.

Result: Achieves 93.72% accuracy on AID, 95.54% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.92% on UC Merced datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net effectively integrates local and global representations through hierarchical fusion, demonstrating superior performance in remote sensing scene classification while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

TL;DR: This study explores using deep learning models to approximate Banff lesion scores for renal transplant biopsies through a modular framework, but finds current AI pipelines have significant limitations in replicating expert-level grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Banff Classification is the global standard for renal transplant biopsy evaluation but faces challenges due to its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability, making computational replication difficult.

Method: Decompose Banff indicators into structural and inflammatory components, use existing segmentation and detection tools to compute them, and map outputs to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines.

Result: Partial successes but critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations undermine interpretability.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines have limitations in replicating computational expert-level grading, emphasizing the need for modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standards to guide future model development in transplant pathology.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline combining VLMs, LLMs, and object detection to enhance high-resolution image captioning by identifying missing objects through co-occurrence prediction and region-specific captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with high-resolution images due to pre-training on low-resolution inputs, leading to loss of visual details and omission of important objects in captions.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Generate initial caption with VLM, 2) LLM identifies key objects and predicts co-occurring objects, 3) Object detection verifies predictions, 4) Region-specific captioning for newly detected objects, 5) Remove references to undetected objects to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution images show the pipeline produces more detailed and reliable captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations, as validated by pairwise comparison, quantitative scoring, and hallucination detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses VLM limitations for high-resolution images by integrating multiple AI components to enrich caption detail and reduce hallucinations through object verification and focused captioning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection is a multi-frame 3D object detection framework that fuses camera and 4D imaging radar data through multi-level feature aggregation and spatiotemporal reasoning to overcome limitations of single-frame fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-frame camera-radar fusion methods capture only partial scene information and suffer from image degradation and radar sparsity. Multi-frame fusion provides richer spatiotemporal information but faces challenges in robust cross-modal feature fusion and computational efficiency.

Method: Uses intermediate features from baseline detector and tracker-generated reference trajectories. Features a two-stage approach with global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar, local-level inter-grid feature aggregation along trajectories, and trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed M^3Detection framework successfully addresses multi-frame fusion challenges by combining multi-level feature aggregation with spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling robust 3D object detection using complementary camera and 4D radar modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

TL;DR: DANCER is a novel framework for realistic single-person dance synthesis using diffusion models, featuring Appearance Enhancement Module and Pose Rendering Module to improve reference image details and motion guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation, especially for human-involved content like dancing, is challenging due to high quality requirements, video continuity needs, and the high degrees of freedom in human motions.

Method: Built on stable video diffusion model, DANCER introduces two modules: Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus on reference image details, and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to extend motion guidance from extra domains. Also created TikTok-3K dataset for enhanced training.

Result: The model shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DANCER effectively addresses the challenges of realistic dance video generation through specialized modules and enhanced training data, achieving better results than existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache is a hierarchical caching mechanism for diffusion models that accelerates inference up to 5.08x while maintaining image quality, using a dual-stage approach with structure-defining and detail-refining stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational costs due to iterative denoising, and existing caching techniques create trade-offs between speed and fidelity with quality degradation and overhead.

Method: H2-Cache uses hierarchical caching with dual-threshold system for structure and detail stages, plus pooled feature summarization (PFS) for fast similarity estimation.

Result: Achieves 5.08x acceleration on Flux architecture while maintaining nearly identical image quality to baseline, outperforming existing caching methods.

Conclusion: H2-Cache effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma in diffusion models, enabling practical real-world deployment of high-fidelity generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell is a novel video identification attack that uses subtitle silhouettes' spatiotemporal features to infer both online and offline videos, achieving high accuracy from distances up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification attacks pose serious privacy threats by revealing users' watching history, which can expose personal information, enable user profiling, and lead to cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail.

Method: The method analyzes subtitle silhouettes displayed on screens, combining spatial (subtitle content shapes) and temporal (time differences between consecutive subtitles) information into spatiotemporal features that correlate with subtitle files.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on smartphones confirm high efficacy in inferring video titles and clips under various settings, including from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell demonstrates a powerful video identification technique that exploits subtitle silhouettes, highlighting significant privacy vulnerabilities in video streaming systems that require mitigation.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPHR is a dual-level reweighting strategy for cross-view geo-localization that addresses hard negatives through sample-level difficulty assessment and batch-level progressive weighting to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery faces challenges from severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives. Existing methods use static weighting that is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, causing noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) with: 1) Sample-level Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module that evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives, and 2) Batch-level Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism that uses training-progress signals to attenuate noisy gradients early and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and robustness, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DPHR provides an effective solution for handling hard negatives in cross-view geo-localization through progressive hardness-aware reweighting that improves training stability and final performance.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse model inversion method to accelerate existing dense inversion approaches by selectively inverting semantic foregrounds while avoiding noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense inversion methods are inefficient for high-resolution images from large-scale ViTs due to redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and unintended inversion of spurious correlations (hallucination).

Method: A plug-and-play sparse model inversion strategy that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while stopping inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations, without modifying original loss functions.

Result: Achieves significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79× faster) while maintaining comparable or enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The sparse model inversion approach effectively addresses inefficiency issues in existing methods and provides practical acceleration for model inversion tasks.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIVA, a new multimodal deception detection task using Werewolf game data, and finds that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle significantly with truth detection in dynamic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more integrated into human lives, robust social intelligence including deception detection is crucial. Current automatic deception detection in dynamic multi-party conversations remains challenging, and MLLMs' capabilities in this domain are unquantified.

Method: Created a novel multimodal dataset from Werewolf game with synchronized video, text, and verifiable ground-truth labels. Established comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs on the new Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA) task.

Result: Significant performance gap found - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to build more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems capable of effective multimodal deception detection in dynamic social interactions.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: The method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic, offering an effective solution to current research limitations in village spatial morphology analysis.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

*Ren Tasai,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Takahiro Ogawa,Kenji Hirata,Minghui Tang,Takaaki Yoshimura,Hiroyuki Sugimori,Noriko Nishioka,Yukie Shimizu,Kohsuke Kudo,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual self-supervised learning framework for chest CT images that addresses domain shifts from different window settings while ensuring data privacy through latent replay and feature distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image diagnosis faces challenges with domain shifts from different CT window settings and privacy constraints that prevent data reuse, requiring robust models that can learn from diverse data without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses continual pretraining with latent replay mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining privacy, and incorporates feature distillation with Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation and batch-knowledge ensemble for robust representations.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on chest CT images across different window settings compared to other approaches, showing effective learning of domain-shift-robust features.

Conclusion: The proposed CSSL framework successfully addresses domain shift challenges in medical imaging while preserving data privacy, providing a practical solution for robust model development in healthcare environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

### [29] [SpecAware: A Spectral-Content Aware Foundation Model for Unifying Multi-Sensor Learning in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27219)
*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that uses sensor meta-attributes and image content to enable unified multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping, achieving strong performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI foundation models overlook sensor meta-attributes and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their transferability across different sensors and scenes.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: 1) Meta-content aware module fuses sensor attributes and image content to generate conditional inputs, 2) HyperEmbedding module uses hypernetwork to dynamically generate matrix factors for adaptive spatial-spectral feature processing.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification tasks.

Conclusion: SpecAware establishes a unified framework for joint pre-training that can adaptively process variable spectral channels and interpret features across diverse sensors and scenes.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more

Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up 3D models is challenging due to geometric supervision complexity and 3D data diversity. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by developing a scalable and adaptable 3D foundation model.

Method: Proposes MoRE with Mixture-of-Experts architecture that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts. Incorporates confidence-based depth refinement, integrates dense semantic features with 3D backbone representations, and uses tailored loss functions for robust learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoRE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: MoRE demonstrates that the Mixture-of-Experts approach effectively addresses scalability challenges in 3D geometric reconstruction, providing a robust foundation model for diverse 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised image retargeting method that treats the task as mesh warping optimization, using CNN to predict mesh deformation while preserving object appearance and geometry without needing labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate geometric distortion in semantically important regions during image retargeting, which remains a challenging problem in the field.

Method: Reformulates image retargeting as learning-based mesh warping optimization using CNN to predict mesh grid motion, with comprehensive objective function including object-consistent loss, geometric-preserving loss, and boundary loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RetargetMe benchmark, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality, with fast inference time (0.009s for 1024x683 resolution).

Conclusion: Object-IR provides an effective self-supervised solution for high-quality image retargeting that preserves important semantic objects while eliminating geometric distortion, with real-time performance on consumer GPUs.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseCPath is a novel framework that fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) for whole slide image analysis, addressing performance variability caused by diverse training data and architectures through multi-view clustering, cluster-level re-embedding, and collaborative distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models show substantial heterogeneity due to diverse private training datasets and different network architectures, leading to performance variability in downstream tasks when using features from different FMs.

Method: Proposes FuseCPath with three key components: (1) multi-view clustering to filter discriminative patches using multiple FMs' embeddings, (2) cluster-level re-embedding strategy to fuse patch-level FMs by capturing local features, and (3) collaborative distillation to explore connections between slide-level FMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets for lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer demonstrate that FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models to achieve superior ensemble performance in computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-phase training method combining spatial and frequency domain denoising using Discrete Wavelet Transform to defend against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks, achieving improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their use in security-critical systems, requiring robust defense mechanisms.

Method: Two-phase training: first trains a denoising network using spatial features and wavelets via transformer layer, then retrains classifier with denoised images.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST show significantly improved classification accuracy compared to existing denoising and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances DNN robustness against adversarial attacks by combining spatial and frequency domain analysis through wavelet transforms.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: A novel adversarial defense method using contrastive learning to improve DNN robustness by training with both clean and adversarially perturbed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause incorrect predictions with small input perturbations, making robust deep-learning systems crucial for deployment.

Method: Utilizes contrastive learning and contrastive loss function to train classification models with both clean and adversarially perturbed images, optimizing model parameters alongside perturbations to learn robust representations.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in model robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using web-crawled descriptions with LLM-extracted keywords to address ambiguity in zero-shot action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in zero-shot action recognition caused by multi-semantic words in action classes, which can lead to incorrect concept understanding.

Method: Use web-crawled descriptions with LLM-extracted keywords to provide semantic context, plus a spatio-temporal interaction module for object and action unit alignment.

Result: Achieved 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600 in zero-shot experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles ambiguity in action recognition, demonstrates strong adaptability across datasets, and reduces manual annotation requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG is a multi-modal RAG framework that shifts retrieval from document-level to region-level, using hybrid supervision to identify relevant patches and grouping them into semantic regions, achieving SOTA performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods use entire documents as retrieval units, introducing irrelevant visual content that dilutes focus on salient information and degrades performance.

Method: Proposes region-level retrieval with hybrid supervision from labeled/unlabeled data to identify relevant patches, and dynamic pipeline to group patches into semantic regions during inference.

Result: Achieves 10.02% improvement in R@1 retrieval accuracy and 3.56% increase in QA accuracy while using only 71.42% visual tokens compared to prior methods across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: RegionRAG enables generators to focus on concise relevant visual content, improving both efficiency and accuracy in multi-modal RAG systems.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: T^3 is a test-time adaptive model merging framework that dynamically combines pretrained and fine-tuned medical vision-language models using Jensen-Shannon divergence to handle modality shifts without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing model-merging techniques that fail in medical imaging due to static interpolation and inability to handle modality shifts, while balancing between generalist robustness and specialist precision.

Method: Uses Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions to compute per-sample interpolation coefficients, with a batch-wise extension (T^3_B) to reduce computational costs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities in in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruption scenarios.

Conclusion: T^3 provides an efficient, backpropagation-free solution for adaptive medical vision-language model deployment that maintains both robustness and precision in clinical settings.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

TL;DR: HyperClick is a framework that improves GUI agent reliability through uncertainty calibration, addressing overconfidence issues in GUI grounding by combining binary rewards with spatial confidence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions, which is critical in dynamic GUI automation where single errors can cause task failure.

Method: Proposes HyperClick with dual reward mechanism: binary reward for correct actions and truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling calibrated using Brier score, jointly optimizing grounding accuracy and confidence reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence.

Conclusion: HyperClick reduces overconfidence and supports more reliable GUI automation through explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for multimodal large language models either uniformly subsample or use retrieval-style scoring, which can miss informative moments and require pre-filtering, limiting their effectiveness for hour-long videos.

Method: FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem using multi-armed bandits, treating temporal clips as arms and using empirical means with Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions through a two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure.

Result: On long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS achieved substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames, with an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench for videos longer than 20 minutes.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements with minimal frame processing through its theoretically-grounded selection approach.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [41] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE is a novel concept erasure method for diffusion models that uses semantic guidance to generate better adversarial samples, achieving 26% better erasure performance while preserving non-target concepts and reducing training time by 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models use adversarial training but neglect the specificity of how adversarial samples fit target concept spaces, leading to partial mitigation and disruption of other concepts.

Method: S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure) leverages semantic guidance within concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Result: Experiments show S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance by 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90% compared to seven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: S-GRACE demonstrates that semantic guidance in adversarial sample generation is crucial for effective concept erasure in diffusion models, achieving superior performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGMamba is a lightweight medical image super-resolution method that combines frequency-aware state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to achieve superior performance with fewer than 0.75M parameters across multiple imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image super-resolution is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing acquisition costs and scanning time, but existing methods struggle to model both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details efficiently.

Method: Proposes FGMamba with two key components: Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) that integrates state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial/channel attention, and Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that captures high-frequency details via FFT-guided fusion across multiple resolutions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, Endoscopic) show superior PSNR/SSIM performance while maintaining compact parameter footprint (<0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware state-space modeling is effective for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement, providing a lightweight solution that balances computational efficiency with high-quality super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that combines multichannel preprocessing, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and contour refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance on stenotic vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical but poor X-ray image quality can impede clinical diagnosis. Automated segmentation of coronary arteries from angiographic images can support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Multichannel preprocessing combining CLAHE and improved Ben Graham method, 2) Segmentation network with UNet architecture using DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder to preserve vessel continuity, 3) Contour refinement module to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% on combined public datasets with both healthy and stenotic arteries, outperforming several state-of-the-art models. Multichannel preprocessing provided incremental gains of 0.31-0.89% DSC and 0.40-1.16% IoU.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust approach for automated coronary artery segmentation that can serve as a valuable tool to support clinicians in CAD diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly for detecting narrow and stenotic vessel branches.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts for incremental object detection, addressing co-occurrence issues by using neural networks as adaptive prompts with constrained updates to prevent forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based approaches assume disjoint class sets, which is unsuitable for object detection where unlabeled objects from previous tasks can appear in current images, causing confusion.

Method: Uses neural networks as parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks, with a parameterized prompts fusion strategy to constrain structure updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in incremental object detection.

Conclusion: P²IOD successfully addresses co-occurrence challenges in incremental object detection through adaptive parameterized prompts with constrained updates.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

*Wenfeng Huang,Xiangyun Liao,Yinling Qian,Hao Liu,Yongming Yang,Wenjing Jia,Qiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGS is a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework that addresses aliasing and artifacts in deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction, achieving superior performance on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for surgical reconstruction prioritize rendering speed but neglect aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which degrade visualization quality in endoscopic scenes.

Method: Proposed SAGS framework with attention-driven dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine tissue movement details.

Result: Superior performance on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks across all metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with better visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses aliasing and artifact issues in deformable tissue reconstruction while maintaining high rendering efficiency, providing improved surgical visualization.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: Proposes an ultra-low bitrate visual communication method that integrates image generation with deep compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for accurate visual communication in bandwidth-constrained scenarios like space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where existing text-to-image models only provide semantic approximations that are insufficient for precise vision analysis.

Method: Seamlessly integrates image generation with deep image compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models. Both semantic text description and coding latent are encoded and transmitted at very low bit rates.

Result: Achieves same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables ultra-low bitrate visual communication without sacrificing accuracy for remote vision analysis and human interactions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer detection remains challenging due to limited high-quality segmentation labels, making robust classification approaches crucial for early detection in large-scale screening.

Method: The approach involves iterative development with experimentation, evaluation, and refinement stages, focusing on classification-based methods rather than segmentation.

Result: A comprehensive solution was developed and implemented, with full code released publicly on GitHub for community use.

Conclusion: Classification-based approaches are essential for advancing early breast cancer detection in MRI screening, and the developed solution provides a foundation for future improvements.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,

TL;DR: CIELR enables complex image editing by converting complex instructions into simple actions using LLM reasoning, eliminating the need for joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex editing instructions and require computationally expensive joint fine-tuning of large language models and diffusion models.

Method: Constructs structured semantic representation of input images using foundation models, then uses iterative update mechanism to refine this representation into fine-grained visual representation for editing.

Result: Surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR on SmartEdit dataset, showing superior preservation of consistent regions. Also outperforms previous methods on new CIEBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CIELR provides an effective approach for complex image editing without expensive joint fine-tuning, achieving better performance while preserving image consistency.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based MLLMs primarily focus on natural images with limited support for other visual modalities like videos and visual documents, creating a gap in multimodal embedding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: first stage for foundational text and multimodal retrieval, second stage with improved InfoNCE loss featuring hardness-weighted mechanism and false negative mitigation, plus learnable temperature and model souping.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on MMEB benchmark with best overall score and outperforms all prior work on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully bridges the modality gap in multimodal embeddings and demonstrates superior performance across diverse visual modalities including videos and documents.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: FPS is a gradient-free parameter selection method that identifies optimal parameter subsets in a single forward pass, achieving comparable performance to SOTA methods while reducing memory usage 9x and accelerating selection 2x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing PEFT methods: addition-based methods cause inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods require full backward passes with high memory usage.

Method: FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data in a single forward pass.

Result: On 24 visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly 9x and accelerating parameter selection by about 2x.

Conclusion: FPS offers a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient synthesis of cinematic scenes for television and film production using small datasets, addressing the need for domain-specific visual styles in media production.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) LoRA modules in cross-attention layers adapt visual representations using small clip datasets, 2) Fine-tuned model generates keyframes that are temporally expanded into coherent sequences. Includes lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning for accelerated inference.

Result: Quantitative evaluations (FVD, CLIP-SIM, LPIPS) and expert user study show improved cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over base model. Efficient domain transfer achieved within hours on single GPU.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables practical cinematic scene synthesis with measurable quality improvements and is released to support reproducibility across cinematic domains.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

TL;DR: Proposes Alignment across Trees method for hierarchical feature alignment in vision-language models by constructing tree-like features for both images and text, using hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures and manifold alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract hierarchical text features but represent images with single features, creating asymmetric and suboptimal modality alignment in vision-language models.

Method: Constructs hierarchical tree features for both images and text using semantic-aware visual feature extraction with cross-attention. Embeds feature trees into hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures and aligns them using a KL distance measure on heterogeneous manifolds.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical alignment method effectively addresses modality asymmetry and improves vision-language model performance through manifold alignment.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

TL;DR: A hybrid deepfake detection framework combining forensic features with deep learning outperforms single-method approaches and shows robustness to compression, adversarial attacks, and unseen manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods have limitations - deep learning lacks generalization and forensic analysis struggles with new manipulation techniques, creating a need for more robust and interpretable solutions.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from CNNs and vision transformers.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77 on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, and DFDC datasets, outperforming baselines. Showed robustness under compression (F1=0.87), adversarial perturbations (AUC=0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1=0.79).

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches provide balanced solutions combining deep learning adaptability with forensic interpretability, enabling resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper audits fairness in breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing age-related bias against younger patients and showing how data aggregation affects ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in medical image segmentation remains underexplored, and unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in care quality for certain populations.

Method: Audited the fairness of automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset, evaluating segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source.

Result: Revealed intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that persists after controlling for confounding factors, and showed how aggregating data from multiple sources influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: Investigating data at a granular level is necessary to address segmentation biases, as physiological factors may contribute to age-related bias that affects both radiologists and automated systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [55] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval by proposing methods to preserve semantic relationships in text queries and disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods treat text-video pairs as binary positives/negatives, ignoring semantic variation within videos and across different videos, causing embeddings of similar content to collapse together and dissimilar content to be driven apart.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning to preserve semantic relationships in text queries, and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks show the framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address semantic collapse in both text and video embedding spaces, leading to significant improvements in partially relevant video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised framework for blind image deconvolution that uses self-diffusion without pre-training, achieving superior performance by iteratively refining sharp images and blur kernels through optimized neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional blind deconvolution methods rely on handcrafted priors, while deep learning approaches need extensive pre-training on external datasets, limiting adaptability to real-world scenarios. There's a need for methods that don't require prior training.

Method: DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an iterative reverse self-diffusion process starting from pure noise. It uses two randomly-initialized neural networks optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and blur kernel, guided by data consistency and L1-norm sparsity. A key innovation is the noise scheduling mechanism for stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios. It demonstrates remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides an effective zero-shot solution for blind image deconvolution that dynamically learns instance-specific priors without requiring pre-training, making it highly adaptable to real-world applications.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on

*Jianwen Sun,Fanrui Zhang,Yukang Feng,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Yifan Chang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration that addresses limitations of current generative models by providing element-level control and post-editability through specialized modules working collaboratively to produce vector graphics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models have two major limitations: rasterized images lack semantic structure for editing, while code-based methods are cumbersome and unintuitive. Neither approach meets the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in scientific creation.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three specialized modules (Manager, Designer, and Toolbox) built on model context protocol to collaboratively produce vector graphics diagrams. It also introduces VisBench benchmark with seven-dimensional metrics for systematic evaluation.

Result: The framework enables true element-level control where any element can be added and modified later. Extensive ablation experiments verified the architecture's rationality and evaluation methods' reliability, with fair model rankings and capability comparisons provided.

Conclusion: VisPainter successfully bridges the gap between current generative approaches by providing both intuitive manipulation and element-level control for scientific illustrations, with systematic evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping using ML and satellite imagery to improve educational facility records in developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and infrequent updates of educational facility records in developing regions, improving accuracy and completeness for better planning and resource allocation.

Method: Three-tier approach: 1) ML analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure to identify gaps; 2) Satellite imagery analysis (medium-resolution removed later); 3) Very high-resolution imagery with deep learning for detailed candidate locations, combined with interactive human validation interface.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show the framework provides scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping.

Conclusion: The multi-tiered human-in-the-loop strategy effectively improves school mapping accuracy and supports planning in resource-constrained regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Referee is a reference-aware audiovisual deepfake detection method that uses one-shot speaker-specific cues to detect manipulations by matching identity-related queries across reference and target content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes from advanced generative models pose serious threats, and existing audiovisual detection approaches struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries, requiring more robust methods.

Method: Leverages speaker-specific cues from one-shot examples to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal artifacts by matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, jointly reasoning about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Cross-modal identity verification is crucial for future deepfake detection, and Referee provides an effective approach for generalizable detection.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAUTILUS, an underwater large multimodal model with a vision feature enhancement module, and NautData, a 1.45M image-text dataset for underwater scene understanding across 8 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater exploration is important for resource exploration and national security, but lacks large-scale multi-task datasets and suffers from image degradation issues that hinder automated underwater scene understanding.

Method: Constructed NautData dataset with 1.45M image-text pairs for 8 tasks, and developed a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module using physical priors from underwater imaging models to restore clear information. Integrated VFE into LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL to create NAUTILUS.

Result: Experiments on NautData and public datasets show VFE consistently improves baseline performance on most tasks, demonstrating NAUTILUS's superiority in underwater scene understanding.

Conclusion: NAUTILUS with VFE module effectively addresses underwater image degradation and advances underwater scene understanding, with data and models publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified multimodal model that generates interleaved text-image reasoning chains where text and vision complement each other to advance reasoning, achieving significant performance gains and emergent multimodal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear nature of meaningful interleaved multimodal reasoning chains and explore how text and vision can function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities.

Method: Fine-tuned a unified model on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement, learning to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining verbal logic.

Result: Achieved 34.7% average gains on vision-centric benchmarks, matched or surpassed larger proprietary VLMs on out-of-domain tasks, and exhibited emergent multimodal intelligence including visual manipulation skills and adaptive reasoning mode switching.

Conclusion: The findings suggest promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities of unified multimodal reasoning models, demonstrating the value of complementary text-image reasoning chains.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection that embeds watermarks using SVD and extracts them using PointNet++, achieving superior performance against geometric attacks compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade conventional watermarks, requiring robust copyright protection methods for digital media.

Method: Embed binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD, then use PointNet++ neural network for robust watermark extraction under various attacks.

Result: Deep learning extraction achieved bitwise accuracy of 0.83 and IoU of 0.80, significantly outperforming traditional SVD methods (0.58 accuracy, 0.26 IoU) on severe crop attacks.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based approach provides superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity even under severe distortions, offering effective copyright protection for 3D point clouds.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a unified framework for segmenting historical map images and time series by treating them as videos, enabling improved geometric accuracy and temporal analysis with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of historical maps is challenging due to stylistic variability and scarce annotated data. Creating linked spatio-temporal datasets from map time series is labor-intensive but essential for applications like dating buildings and studying environmental changes.

Method: Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 treats historical map images and time series as videos. For images, it processes tiles as videos to leverage memory attention for contextual cues. For time series, it introduces the Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and generates pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating temporal transformations.

Result: Experimental results show MapSAM2 effectively learns temporal associations and accurately segments and links buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 provides an effective framework for historical map analysis with improved geometric accuracy and temporal modeling capabilities, and the authors will release the dataset and code to support future research.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval, including a new benchmark (UVRB), scalable data synthesis, and a novel training curriculum (Modality Pyramid) that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems are structurally misaligned due to narrow benchmarks that incentivize limited data and single-task training, suppressing universal capability. There's an absence of diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization.

Method: Three-part framework: 1) Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets for capability diagnosis, 2) Scalable synthesis workflow generating 1.55M high-quality pairs to populate semantic space, 3) Modality Pyramid curriculum training General Video Embedder (GVE) by leveraging data interconnections.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. Analysis reveals popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability, and partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval, addressing critical capability gaps across tasks and domains.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple unified principle for learning binary codes using cross-view alignment with binary cross-entropy loss and coding-rate maximization regularization, achieving state-of-the-art hashing performance in just 5 training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale retrieval requires compact and discriminative representations. While foundation models provide powerful embeddings, nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing enables efficient Hamming distance search but existing approaches are complex, require multi-term objectives, and have long training times.

Method: CroVCA uses cross-view code alignment with a single binary cross-entropy loss to enforce consistency across semantically aligned views, plus coding-rate maximization as an anti-collapse regularizer. HashCoder is designed as a lightweight MLP hashing network with batch normalization for balanced codes, usable as a probing head on frozen embeddings or via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in just 5 training epochs. Unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU at 16 bits.

Conclusion: CroVCA demonstrates exceptional efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability for large-scale retrieval through its simple unified approach to learning binary codes.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [68] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR is a framework that uses supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to create robust neural networks resistant to adversarial attacks by clustering embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions together in the embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where small, imperceptible changes to images can cause wrong predictions. The gradients that help models learn can also be exploited to create these attacks.

Method: Leverages supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to learn representations where embeddings for images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions cluster together for same-class images while being separated from other classes.

Result: On CIFAR-10, achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features

attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial understanding in LVLMs depend on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scalability.

Method: Proposes Spatial-SSRL with five self-supervised pretext tasks: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction.

Result: Achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines on seven spatial understanding benchmarks in image and video settings.

Conclusion: Simple, intrinsic supervision enables reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

TL;DR: DUST is a dual-stream diffusion framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models by separately handling observation and action modalities while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing, achieving significant performance gains in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of jointly predicting next-state observations and action sequences in VLAs due to inherent modality differences, and improve robotic policy learning through world modeling.

Method: Proposes a multimodal diffusion transformer with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations for each modality, decoupled flow-matching loss, and joint sampling with test-time scaling for asynchronous evolution of action and vision tokens.

Result: Achieves up to 6% gains over baselines on RoboCasa and GR-1 benchmarks, with test-time scaling providing additional 2-5% boost. Real-world Franka Research 3 tasks show 13% success rate improvement. Pre-training on BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains.

Conclusion: DUST effectively handles modality conflicts in VLAs through dual-stream architecture and enables scalable robotic policy learning with strong performance in both simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces sketch-to-layout generation using multimodal transformers, with synthetic sketch generation to overcome data scarcity, achieving SOTA performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout generation methods require complex user constraints that reduce usability, while sketches provide more intuitive guidance.

Method: Multimodal transformer-based solution using sketches and content assets as inputs, with novel synthetic sketch generation for training data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods on PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA datasets.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is a promising research direction, and the authors release synthetic sketch datasets to facilitate future work.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

TL;DR: VessShape generates synthetic 2D datasets with tubular geometries to instill shape bias in segmentation models, improving few-shot and zero-shot performance on real-world blood vessel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity and poor cross-domain generalization in blood vessel segmentation by leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes rather than texture-based features.

Method: Introduce VessShape methodology for generating large-scale synthetic datasets with procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with diverse foreground/background textures to encourage shape learning.

Result: Models pre-trained on VessShape achieve strong few-shot segmentation with only 4-10 samples for fine-tuning and exhibit notable zero-shot capabilities on unseen domains without target-specific training.

Conclusion: Pre-training with strong shape bias is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab proposes a negotiated common representation method for heterogeneous collaborative perception, addressing domain gaps between different agents' models through a negotiator and alignment losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception causes domain gaps in shared features due to different fixed perception models, degrading performance. Existing methods using specific agent representations struggle with significant domain discrepancies.

Method: Introduces a negotiator to derive common representation from local representations, uses sender-receiver pairs for feature transformation, and applies structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses for training.

Result: The method effectively reduces domain gaps between various local representations and enables full knowledge distillation from common representation to senders.

Conclusion: NegoCollab successfully addresses heterogeneous collaboration challenges through negotiated common representation and comprehensive alignment supervision, improving collaborative perception performance.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Pengjun Huang,Hengyuan Zhang,Hubin Du,Yongtao Liu,Yinglin Wang,Qang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) as a new similarity metric for object detection that addresses limitations of IoU and Wasserstein Distance, particularly for small object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU-based metrics perform poorly with small objects due to sensitivity to positional deviations, while Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance and has slow convergence when used as loss function.

Method: Introduces Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) which possesses scale invariance and facilitates joint optimization of bounding box attributes through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient properties.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD-v2 dataset show GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance for tiny object detection. Validation on MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets demonstrates superior performance over Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales.

Conclusion: GCD effectively addresses the limitations of existing similarity metrics, providing better generalization capability, faster convergence, and improved localization performance for object detection, especially for small objects.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Conclusion: Deep denoising is established as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron

Motivation: Most medical vision-language applications are limited to 2D imaging, while PET/CT involves large 3D volumetric data with small dispersed lesions and lengthy reports that need better multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with 11,000+ lesion descriptions and 3D segmentations from 5,000+ PET/CT exams using hybrid rule-based/LLM pipeline, then developed PETAR-4B model that bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness.

Result: PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality in both automated and human evaluations, producing clinically coherent and localized findings.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling spatially grounded report generation for complex 3D medical imaging data.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D

*Xiangyu Fan,Zesong Qiu,Zhuguanyu Wu,Fanzhou Wang,Zhiqian Lin,Tianxiang Ren,Dahua Lin,Ruihao Gong,Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to improve generative model performance while maintaining diversity, addressing limitations of one-step DMD and traditional multi-step approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step DMD models underperform on complex tasks like text-to-video generation due to limited model capacity, while direct multi-step extension causes memory issues, computational depth, instability, and reduced diversity.

Method: Divides SNR range into subintervals with progressive distribution matching and score matching within each subinterval, using phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to reduce learning difficulty while enhancing capacity.

Result: Successfully distilled state-of-the-art models (Qwen-Image 20B, Wan2.2 28B), preserving output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Phased DMD effectively bridges the gap between one-step and multi-step distillation, providing improved performance on complex generative tasks without sacrificing diversity or efficiency.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-contact ECG monitoring using radar signals enables unobtrusive cardiac monitoring, but existing approaches use fixed wavelet methods that lack adaptability.

Method: Uses learnable lifting wavelets with lifting/inverse lifting units for adaptive feature capture, and multi-resolution STFT loss for temporal/spectral consistency with ground-truth ECG.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets in ECG reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability).

Conclusion: LifWavNet establishes a robust framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement with interpretable multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

*Bingyan Xie,Jihong Park,Yongpeng Wu,Wenjun Zhang,Tony Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes MHPSC framework for multi-hop wireless image transmission with parallel residual compensation to combat distortion accumulation, using coarse-to-fine residual compression to minimize bandwidth overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication schemes focus on single-hop scenarios and overlook multi-hop challenges where distortion accumulates over multiple hops, causing significant performance degradation.

Method: MHPSC introduces parallel residual compensation link at each hop with coarse-to-fine residual compression: deep learning-based residual compressor followed by adaptive arithmetic coding with residual distribution estimation for prior distribution prediction.

Result: Experimental results show MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes with only minor bandwidth increase.

Conclusion: MHPSC framework enables robust multi-hop image transmission by effectively addressing distortion accumulation through parallel residual compensation and efficient compression.

Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop
scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission.
As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over
multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this,
we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC)
framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop
against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission
bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A
deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed
by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual
distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to
achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop
image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth.
Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic
communication and traditional separated coding schemes.

*Fardad Vakilipoor,Johannes Konrad,Maximilian Schäfer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inverse Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (IBAA) to compute distortion functions that quantify cellular decision-making criteria under uncertainty, validated through apoptosis and chemotaxis models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how cells process environmental signals and make context-dependent decisions under uncertainty, using chemotaxis as an example where cells navigate noisy chemical gradients.

Method: Apply information-theoretic framework based on rate distortion theory (RDT), develop inverse Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (IBAA) to compute distortion functions, and validate using cellular apoptosis and LEGI chemotaxis models.

Result: Successfully estimated theoretical distortion functions in apoptosis scenario and computed state-dependent decision criteria from cell's perspective in chemotaxis, revealing state-dependent decision criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed IBAA provides a general framework for analyzing efficient information processing under uncertainty in biological and engineered systems, revealing how cells balance sensing accuracy with resource costs.

Abstract: Cellular intelligence enables cells to process environmental signals and make
context-dependent decisions, as exemplified by chemotaxis, where cells navigate
chemical gradients despite noisy signaling pathways. To investigate how cells
deal with uncertainty, we apply an information-theoretic framework based on
rate distortion theory (RDT). The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA) computes
optimal decision strategies that minimize mutual information while satisfying
distortion constraints, balancing sensing accuracy with distortion constraint
equivalent to resource cost. We propose the inverse Blahut-Arimoto algorithm
(IBAA) to compute the distortion function, which quantifies the system's
decision-making criteria for realizing a decision strategy to map input signals
to outputs. This general framework extends beyond chemotaxis to biological and
engineered systems requiring efficient information processing under
uncertainty. We validate the proposed IBAA by accurately estimating theoretical
distortion functions in a cellular apoptosis scenario. Additionally, using the
local excitation global inhibition (LEGI) model to simulate chemotactic
responses, we compute the distortion functions from the cell's perspective. Our
finding reveals a state-dependent decision criteria by the cell.

*Dengming Xu,Mengmeng LI*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper improves lower bounds for constant dimension codes (CDCs) using multilevel construction with skeleton codes based on binary vector transformations from one-factorization of complete graphs and quasi-pending blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constant dimension codes are important for random network coding applications, and the multilevel construction is an effective method for constructing them. The goal is to improve existing lower bounds for specific parameters.

Method: Uses multilevel construction: (1) selects appropriate skeleton codes based on binary vector transformations related to one-factorization of complete graphs, (2) constructs CDCs using chosen skeleton codes with quasi-pending blocks, (3) calculates dimensions using known constructions of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes.

Result: Improved lower bounds for A_q(n,8,6) for dimensions 16 ≤ n ≤ 19.

Conclusion: The proposed multilevel construction method successfully improves the lower bounds for constant dimension codes with specific parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach using skeleton codes and quasi-pending blocks.

Abstract: Constant dimension codes (CDCs) have become an important object in coding
theory due to their application in random network coding. The multilevel
construction is one of the most effective ways to construct constant dimension
codes. The paper is devoted to constructing CDCs by the multilevel
construction. Precisely, we first choose an appropriate skeleton code based on
the transformations of binary vectors related to the one-factorization of
complete graphs; then we construct CDCs by using the chosen skeleton code,
where quasi-pending blocks are used; finally, we calculate the dimensions by
use of known constructions of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes. As
applications, we improve the lower bounds of $\overline{A}_q(n,8,6)$ for
$16\leq n\leq 19.$

*Gaoyuan Zhang,Ruisong Si,Boyuan Li,Zijian Li,Baofeng Ji,Chenqi Zhu,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a secure communication scheme for MIMO networks against RIS-enhanced mobile eavesdroppers using random bit-flipping and SVD-based precoding, without requiring eavesdropper's full CSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat of mobile eavesdroppers using RIS to optimize their received signal strength and manipulate wiretap channels in MIMO wireless networks.

Method: Uses random bit-flipping scheme to minimize mutual information between secret message and eavesdropper, combined with SVD-based precoding for optimal power allocation and interference management.

Result: The scheme is practically desired as it doesn't require prior knowledge of eavesdropper's full instantaneous CSI, and shows effectiveness across various attacking scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed secure communication scheme provides robust protection against RIS-enhanced mobile eavesdropping attacks in MIMO networks through information-theoretic approaches.

Abstract: We pay our attention towards secure and robust communication in the presence
of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced mobile eavesdropping
attacker in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)wireless
networks.Specifically,we first provide a unifying framework that generalizes
specific intelligent wiretap model wherein the passive eavesdropper configured
with any number of antennas is potentially mobile and can actively optimize its
received signal strength with the help of RIS by intelligently manipulating
wiretap channel characteristics.To effectively mitigate this intractable
threat,we then propose a novel and lightweight secure communication scheme from
the perspective of information theory.The main idea is that the data processing
can in some cases be observed as communication channel,and a random
bit-flipping scheme is then carefully involved for the legitimate transmitter
to minimize the mutual information between the secret message and the passive
eavesdropper's received data.The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based
precoding strategy is also implemented to optimize power allocation,and thus
ensure that the legitimate receiver is not subject to interference from this
random bit-flipping.The corresponding results depict that our secure
communication scheme is practically desired, which does not require any a prior
knowledge of the eavesdropper's full instantaneous Channel State Information
(ICSI). Furthermore,we consider the RIS optimization problem from the
eavesdropper's perspective,and provide RIS phase shift design solutions under
different attacking scenarios.Finally,the optimal detection schemes
respectively for the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are provided,and
comprehensive simulations are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and
show the effectiveness and robustness of our secure communication scheme across
a wide range of attacking scenarios.

### [85] [Byzantine Attacks in RIS-Enhanced Cooperative Spectrum Sensing: A Decision Fusion Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27175)
*Gaoyuan Zhang,Gaolei Song,Boyuan Li,Zijian Li,Baofeng Ji,Ruijuan Zheng,Guoqiang Zheng,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Byzantine attacks in RIS-enhanced cooperative spectrum sensing for mobile cognitive radio networks, developing optimal attack strategies that don't require global channel state information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Byzantine attacks in RIS-enhanced cooperative spectrum sensing under dynamic mobile scenarios, where traditional approaches heavily rely on global channel information that is impractical for attackers to obtain.

Method: Constructed RIS-enhanced CSS configuration with decode-and-forward relays, developed channel- and attack-aware hard decision fusion rules, and derived optimal Byzantine attack strategies for both small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios.

Result: Found that optimal attack strategies don't require global instantaneous channel state information, can be achieved through a unifying framework regardless of attacker's awareness of fusion rules, and effectiveness primarily depends on fraction of Byzantine nodes rather than channel dynamics.

Conclusion: Successfully relaxed the heavy reliance on global channel state information and decision fusion rules in Byzantine attack analysis, making channel-aware approaches more practical for mobile cognitive radio networks.

Abstract: From the perspective of hard decision fusion, we investigate Byzantine
attacks in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for mobile
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in this paper. Specially, a RIS-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under
dynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and
attack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal
channel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both
small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results
depict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge
of the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm
probability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although
perfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker
perspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward
relays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that
leads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also
indicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion
rule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying
framework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking
effectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes
rather than the channel dynamics. That is, to make the channel-aware approach
more practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and
decision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully
relaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through
extensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios.

*Xu Gan,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-scale deployment framework for pinching antenna systems with coarse large-scale transfer and fine small-scale relocation, achieving 70% higher energy efficiency than cell-free systems and nearly double MIMO performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency in wireless communication systems by optimizing antenna deployment through a dual-scale approach that combines large-scale transfer with high-precision small-scale relocation.

Method: A dual-scale deployment framework with four deployment protocols, joint optimization of transmit precoding, PA radiation power, and PA deployment using a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm.

Result: PASS delivers 70% higher energy efficiency than conventional cell-free architecture and nearly twofold improvement relative to MIMO systems, with validated theoretical accuracy and algorithm convergence.

Conclusion: The dual-scale deployment framework with proper resolution and protocol specification is essential for achieving maximum energy efficiency in pinching antenna systems.

Abstract: A dual-scale deployment (DSD) framework for pinching antenna systems (PASS)
is proposed. 1) In the first coarse stage, the pinching antenna (PA) is
transferred over a large-scale range at the waveguide level. 2) The refinement
stage performs small-scale relocation of the PA with high precision. Four PA
deployment protocols are provided in the proposed DSD framework. Then, a
practical power consumption model is proposed, based on which the theoretical
energy efficiency formulas for PASS are derived. The transmit precoding, PA
radiation power, and PA deployment are jointly optimized to maximize the energy
efficiency under the provided PA deployment protocols. To solve this
non-convex, highly coupled problem, a low-complexity penalty-based alternating
optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of
theoretical results and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is
demonstrated that: 1) PASS delivers about 70% higher energy efficiency than the
conventional cell-free architecture and nearly twofold improvement relative to
MIMO systems; 2) it is essential to specify the DSD resolution and deployment
protocol to achieve the maximum energy efficiency for PASS.

Conclusion: CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization, beam management, digital twins, and intelligent resource allocation in 6G networks.

Abstract: Accurate cross-band channel prediction is essential for 6G networks,
particularly in the upper mid-band (FR3, 7--24 GHz), where penetration loss and
blockage are severe. Although ray tracing (RT) provides high-fidelity modeling,
it remains computationally intensive, and high-frequency data acquisition is
costly. To address these challenges, we propose CIR-UNext, a deep learning
framework designed to predict 7 GHz channel impulse responses (CIRs) by
leveraging abundant 3.5 GHz CIRs. The framework integrates an RT-based dataset
pipeline with attention U-Net (AU-Net) variants for gain and phase prediction.
The proposed AU-Net-Aux model achieves a median gain error of 0.58 dB and a
phase prediction error of 0.27 rad on unseen complex environments. Furthermore,
we extend CIR-UNext into a foundation model, Channel2ComMap, for throughput
prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating superior performance compared
with existing approaches. Overall, CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable
solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the theory of weight enumerators from traditional settings (finite fields, abelian groups, Frobenius rings) to more general equivalence relations and determine the conditions under which MacWilliams relations remain valid.

Method: Define weight enumerators with respect to equivalence relations, analyze conditions for MacWilliams relations to hold, and study specific enumerators for particular equivalence relations.

Result: The paper identifies cases where MacWilliams relations are preserved for weight enumerators defined under equivalence relations, providing theoretical foundations for these generalizations.

Conclusion: The research establishes a framework for extending weight enumerator theory to equivalence relations and characterizes when fundamental properties like MacWilliams relations are maintained.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider codes over finite fields, finite abelian groups,
and finite Frobenius rings. For such codes, the complete weight enumerator and
the Hamming weight enumerator serve as powerful tools. These two types of
weight enumerators satisfy the MacWilliams relations. We define the weight
enumerator of a code with respect to an equivalence relation and determine in
which cases the MacWilliams relations hold for this weight enumerator. We also
study some weight enumerators for specific equivalence relations.

### [89] [Layer of Truth: Probing Belief Shifts under Continual Pre-Training Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26829)
*Svetlana Churina,Niranjan Chebrolu,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can develop persistent false beliefs through repeated exposure to misinformation during continual pre-training, similar to the human illusory truth effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs exhibit vulnerability to misinformation through repeated exposure during continual pre-training, inspired by the human illusory truth effect.

Method: Developed Layer of Truth framework with controlled data poisoning, probing intermediate representations across checkpoints, model scales, and question types to quantify belief shifts.

Result: Even minimal exposure to false information induces persistent representational drift in established facts, with varying susceptibility across layers and model sizes.

Conclusion: Continually updated LLMs can internalize misinformation like humans, highlighting the need for robust monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

*Guangzhi Su,Shuchang Huang,Yutong Ke,Zhuohang Liu,Long Qian,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmoothGuard is a lightweight defense framework that enhances MLLM robustness against adversarial attacks through randomized noise injection and clustering-based prediction aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, raising safety and reliability concerns in deployment.

Method: Perturbs continuous modalities with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced predictions, selecting final answer from majority cluster.

Result: Extensive experiments show SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive utility, with optimal noise range of 0.1-0.2.

Conclusion: SmoothGuard provides an effective defense framework that enhances MLLM robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising utility.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

TL;DR: FedPF is a differentially private fair federated learning algorithm that frames privacy-fairness optimization as a zero-sum game, revealing an inherent tension where stricter privacy limits bias correction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge in federated learning of simultaneously ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client data through differential privacy.

Method: Transforms multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility, with theoretical analysis of the inverse relationship between privacy and fairness.

Result: Achieves up to 42.9% discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy, but demonstrates that privacy-fairness tension is unavoidable and requires balanced compromises.

Conclusion: The privacy-fairness tension is fundamental and unavoidable; achieving both objectives requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimizing either in isolation, with moderate fairness constraints initially improving generalization before causing degradation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

*Zhiyuan Ning,Jiawei Shao,Ruge Xu,Xinfei Guo,Jun Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAS-Spec is a novel self-speculative decoding method that uses dynamic inference acceleration strategies and a dynamic tree cascade algorithm to achieve state-of-the-art LLM inference acceleration without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-speculative methods fall short of specialized training approaches, while cascade methods are impractical due to high training costs. There's a need for efficient on-the-fly acceleration that bridges this gap.

Method: Uses dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies like layer sparsity and activation quantization to create draft models. Introduces Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm for adaptive routing and draft length assignment based on acceptance rates and latency prediction.

Result: Achieves 1.1× to 2.3× average speedup over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves speedup by 47% over cascade baseline and 48% over tree-based baseline.

Conclusion: CAS-Spec provides state-of-the-art acceleration that can be easily integrated into existing LLMs and has promising potential for further improvement as self-speculative techniques evolve.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

*Mahsa Valizadeh,Rui Tuo,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BI-DCGAN is a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that addresses mode collapse by incorporating model uncertainty through Bayes by Backprop and variational inference, theoretically proving and experimentally demonstrating improved sample diversity while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs suffer from mode collapse where they generate limited outputs, which is problematic for real-world applications requiring diversity and uncertainty awareness. Current alternatives like diffusion models are too resource-intensive.

Method: BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn distributions over network weights and uses mean-field variational inference to approximate posterior distributions during GAN training, extending the DCGAN architecture with Bayesian modeling.

Result: The paper provides the first theoretical proof (via covariance matrix analysis) that Bayesian modeling enhances GAN diversity, and experimental results show BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs while maintaining training efficiency.

Conclusion: BI-DCGAN offers a scalable solution for applications requiring both diversity and uncertainty, positioning it as a practical alternative to resource-intensive methods like diffusion models.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Result: Developed a framework that constrains LLM outputs to ontology-linked terms and quantifies both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy through evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The integration of symbolic structure and neural generation provides enhanced interpretability and reliability for applying LLMs in chemical engineering domains.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)

generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EV charging behavior models are limited by small datasets, simple temporal modeling, and poor generalization to new sites with limited history, hindering effective infrastructure planning for transportation decarbonization.

Method: Proposes an integrated framework that uses clustering to identify site archetypes and few-shot forecasting to predict charging demand, leveraging a novel large-scale charging dataset.

Result: Archetype-specific expert models demonstrate superior performance in forecasting demand at unseen sites compared to global baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework enables actionable insights for infrastructure segmentation, helping operators reduce costs, optimize energy/pricing strategies, and support grid resilience essential for climate goals.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of

a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

*Zimeng Huang,Jinxin Ke,Xiaoxuan Fan,Yufeng Yang,Yang Liu,Liu Zhonghan,Zedi Wang,Junteng Dai,Haoyi Jiang,Yuyu Zhou,Keze Wang,Ziliang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MM-OPERA is a benchmark for evaluating association intelligence in Large Vision-Language Models through open-ended tasks that mimic human cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack fundamental association intelligence capabilities like creative thinking and knowledge integration, which are crucial for human-like AI but not adequately measured by existing closed-ended benchmarks.

Method: Created MM-OPERA benchmark with 11,497 instances across two open-ended tasks (Remote-Item Association and In-Context Association), using LLM-as-a-Judge strategies with process-reward-informed judgment to evaluate free-form responses and reasoning paths.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation revealed significant limitations in current LVLMs' associative reasoning abilities across various dimensions including task sensitivity, judgment validity, and diversity across abilities, domains, languages, and cultures.

Conclusion: The study provides nuanced understanding of LVLMs' association intelligence gaps and establishes a foundation for developing more human-like and general-purpose AI systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

### [97] [Mind the Gaps: Auditing and Reducing Group Inequity in Large-Scale Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26940)
*Ashwin Kumar,Hanyu Zhang,David A. Schweidel,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper audits mobility prediction models for demographic disparities and proposes FGIS, a fairness-guided sampling method that reduces performance gaps between racial groups by up to 40% with minimal accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hidden disparities in mobility prediction models based on user demographics, as current models show systematic performance differences across racial and ethnic groups due to underlying dataset biases.

Method: Proposed Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS) with Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM) clustering to create proxy racial labels from census data, then incrementally samples users based on expected performance gains and group representation.

Result: The method reduces total disparity between groups by up to 40% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, with most significant improvements in early sampling stages. Evaluated on MetaPath2Vec and transformer-encoder models.

Conclusion: Mobility prediction pipelines contain structural inequities, but lightweight data-centric interventions like FGIS can meaningfully improve fairness, especially in low-resource settings, with little added complexity.

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

*Adam Winchell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes updating the Turing Test by adding an energy efficiency constraint to better distinguish human and machine intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Turing Test is no longer adequate as AI systems can pass it, and there are serious ethical and environmental concerns about AI's resource consumption.

Method: Expands the Turing Test by incorporating energy spent answering questions as an additional evaluation factor, focusing on efficiency.

Result: Creates a new test that evaluates intelligence through the lens of energy efficiency and provides a measurable, practical finish line.

Conclusion: The energy-constrained Turing Test forces society to weigh AI's time savings against its total resource costs, making intelligence evaluation more realistic and practical.

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

### [99] [Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957)
*Qiao Wang,Joseph George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using publicly available imagery and geospatial data to predict household water consumption in urban India, achieving accuracy comparable to traditional survey methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional household water monitoring methods are costly and time-intensive, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions where timely data is crucial for urban planning and resource management.

Method: Four approaches compared: survey features (benchmark), CNN embeddings from satellite and Google Street View imagery, and GSV semantic maps with auxiliary geospatial data (nightlight intensity, population density) under an ordinal classification framework.

Result: GSV segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieved 0.55 accuracy for water use prediction, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). High precision at consumption extremes but confusion among middle classes due to overlapping visual proxies.

Conclusion: Open-access imagery combined with minimal geospatial data provides a promising alternative to traditional surveys for obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates in urban analytics applications.

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

*Zhichao Hou,Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes fine-grained control for iterative adversarial attacks to maximize effectiveness within fixed compute budgets by selectively recomputing layer activations across iterations and layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maximizing adversarial attack strength under limited compute budgets, as coarse iteration reduction weakens effectiveness significantly.

Method: Fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels to optimize attack efficacy within budget constraints.

Result: Method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost, and when integrated into adversarial training, achieves comparable performance with only 30% of original budget.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained activation recomputation approach effectively maximizes adversarial attack strength under computational constraints, offering significant efficiency gains for AI safety research.

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

### [101] [HADSF: Aspect Aware Semantic Control for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26994)
*Zheng Nie,Peijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HADSF is a two-stage framework that creates compact aspect vocabularies and performs constrained extraction of aspect-opinion triples from reviews, addressing LLM hallucination issues in recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based information extraction methods for recommender systems suffer from uncontrolled scope, noisy representations, lack of hallucination metrics, and unexplored cost-quality trade-offs across model scales.

Method: Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF) with two stages: (1) adaptive selection of corpus-level aspect vocabulary, (2) vocabulary-guided constrained extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. Introduces Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR) metrics.

Result: Experiments on 3M reviews across LLMs (1.5B-70B parameters) show consistent reductions in rating prediction error. Enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance. Uncovers nonmonotonic relationship between hallucination severity and prediction error.

Conclusion: HADSF provides an effective solution for hallucination-aware LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation, with reproducible code and metrics available for further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMOC framework embeds algorithm implementations into feature space for similarity analysis, enabling clustering, classification, and diversity quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for pragmatic similarity metrics to determine meaningful differences between algorithms for applications like clone detection and program synthesis.

Method: Introduces EMOC (Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity) framework that embeds algorithms into feature space, compiled PACD dataset of verified Python implementations.

Result: EMOC features support clustering/classification of algorithm types, near-duplicate detection, and diversity quantification in LLM-generated programs.

Conclusion: Framework provides consistent similarity metric for algorithm comparison, with released code/data for reproducibility.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework that treats learning rules as policies for navigating loss landscapes, identifying optimal rules as solutions to an optimal control problem. Various well-known optimization methods emerge naturally under different assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some learning rules work better than others and establish principled foundations for when specific rules can be considered optimal, rather than assuming rules ad hoc.

Method: The framework casts learning rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes and identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.

Result: Shows that gradient descent, momentum, natural gradients, non-gradient rules, adaptive optimizers like Adam, and continual learning strategies emerge naturally within this framework under different assumptions about horizon, geometry, controllability, and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework unifies various learning phenomena under a single objective, clarifying the computational structure of learning and providing a principled foundation for designing adaptive algorithms.

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

### [104] [A Framework for Fair Evaluation of Variance-Aware Bandit Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27001)
*Elise Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic evaluation framework for multi-armed bandit algorithms that compares classical and variance-aware methods, showing variance-aware approaches excel in high-uncertainty environments with subtle reward differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-armed bandit algorithm evaluation lacks standardization and replicability, especially for variance-aware extensions whose performance depends heavily on environmental conditions.

Method: Developed a reproducible evaluation framework (Bandit Playground) with defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, distribution, value-at-risk, action optimality), and interactive analysis interface.

Result: Variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones in high-uncertainty settings with subtle arm reward differences, while classical algorithms perform equally well or better in separable scenarios or with extensive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study provides both a systematic evaluation framework for MAB algorithms and insights into when variance-aware approaches are superior to classical methods.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming

*Hongbo Li,Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) framework provides theoretical foundation for transformer-level expert specialization, achieving faster convergence than single transformers through a three-stage training algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts models lack unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and attention layers can specialize. Need to understand core learning dynamics of expert specialization and attention alignment.

Method: Developed MoT framework with continuously trained gating network, three-stage training algorithm that allows transformer blocks to act as experts specializing in distinct task classes.

Result: Experts specialize in distinct task classes, gating network accurately routes data, reduces gradient conflicts, makes subtasks strongly convex. Achieves O(log(ε⁻¹)) convergence vs O(ε⁻¹) for single transformer. Validated through real-data experiments.

Conclusion: Provides first unified theoretical account of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, offering practical guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentiment classification accuracy while being computationally efficient compared to scaling individual model sizes, by strategically combining diverse models using cognitive diversity principles.

Method: Applied Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate ensemble of diverse ML models including RoBERTa transformer with traditional models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), using rank-score characteristic functions to quantify model dissimilarity.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.072% on IMDB sentiment analysis dataset, outperforming traditional ensemble methods through effective computation and utilization of model diversity.

Conclusion: CFA provides an efficient and effective approach for sentiment classification by strategically combining diverse models using cognitive diversity, offering computational advantages over model scaling while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

*Sina Javadzadeh,Rahil Soroushmojdehi,S. Alireza Seyyed Mousavi,Mehrnaz Asadi,Sumiko Abe,Terence D. Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for cross-subject aggregation of intracranial recordings using functional embeddings and transformers, enabling analysis despite variable electrode placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates fail to capture true functional similarity across subjects due to anatomical variability and imprecise localization.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Siamese encoder with contrastive learning to create subject-agnostic functional embeddings, (2) Transformer that models inter-regional relationships using these embeddings as tokens.

Result: Learned functional space enables accurate within-subject discrimination, forms region-consistent clusters, transfers zero-shot to unseen channels, and captures cross-region dependencies for masked channel reconstruction.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable path for large-scale cross-subject aggregation and pretraining of intracranial neural data without requiring uniform sensor placement or strict task structure.

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first quantitative bounds on the required training sequence length for transformers to achieve length generalization, analyzing different problem settings including error control types, attention precision, and network depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization but left open how large the training sequence length threshold must be. This work aims to provide quantitative bounds on this requirement.

Method: Analyzed length generalization in several problem settings: ℓ∞ error control vs average error control, infinite-precision softmax attention vs finite-precision attention, and one- vs two-layer transformers. Proved LG occurs when transformer behavior on longer sequences can be "simulated" by behavior on shorter training sequences.

Result: Provided quantitative bounds for training length requirements across different scenarios. Verified insights empirically and showed that LG occurs when longer sequence behavior can be simulated by shorter training sequence behavior.

Conclusion: The results sharpen theoretical understanding of extrapolation mechanisms in transformers and formalize the intuition that richer training data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

TL;DR: RLVR improves evaluation metrics on combinatorial problems but often reinforces superficial heuristics rather than genuine reasoning strategies, highlighting limits in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) actually fosters genuine mathematical reasoning in LLMs, rather than just improving superficial metrics.

Method: Tested RLVR on two combinatorial problems (Activity Scheduling and Longest Increasing Subsequence) with fully verifiable solutions, using curated datasets with unique optima and multiple reward designs.

Result: RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often achieves this by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies, showing limited generalization.

Conclusion: Benchmarks need to disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

TL;DR: Consistency training teaches LLMs to be invariant to irrelevant prompt cues like leading questions or jailbreak text, reducing sycophancy and jailbreaking through two methods: BCT (output-level) and ACT (activation-level).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple prompt changes, leading to sycophancy (adopting user beliefs) or jailbreaking (satisfying inappropriate requests wrapped in special text).

Method: Two consistency training approaches: Bias-augmented Consistency Training (BCT) enforces invariance over model outputs, while Activation Consistency Training (ACT) enforces invariance over internal activations. Both use model's own responses as training data.

Result: Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant cues. BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, but BCT performs better at jailbreak reduction. The approach avoids stale training data issues.

Conclusion: Some alignment problems are better viewed as consistency issues rather than optimal response problems. BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing reliance on static datasets.

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in

TL;DR: Analysis of self-play training dynamics in LLM reasoning, comparing it with RLVR and SFT through parameter updates, entropy dynamics, and reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind self-play improvements in LLM reasoning, which remain poorly understood despite showing strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains.

Method: Analyze training dynamics through parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions using the Absolute Zero Reasoner framework.

Result: Findings clarify how self-play differs from other post-training strategies and highlight its inherent limitations.

Conclusion: The study points toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play by better understanding its training dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

*Yiwei Chen,Kehuan Yan,Yu Pan,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) that uses differentiable quantum jump operators to create controllable cross-modal entanglement, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal datasets with enhanced training stability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary transformations for entanglement generation, which suffer from training instability and limited generalizability. There's a need for more robust quantum-inspired approaches that can handle complex cross-modal correlations effectively.

Method: Encodes each modality as a quantum pure state, then uses a differentiable module simulating quantum jump operators to transform separable product states into entangled representations. Jointly learns Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators to generate controllable cross-modal entanglement with dissipative dynamics.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS). Provides enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy analysis.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired approaches in modeling complex cross-modal correlations with improved stability and interpretability.

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

TL;DR: A Bayesian model for deconvolving bulk RNA-seq data into cell-type-specific expression profiles and proportions using single-cell reference data, applied to study endometrial tissue dynamics across the menstrual cycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bulk RNA-seq obscures cell type-specific dynamics in heterogeneous tissues, particularly problematic for studying tissues like endometrium that undergo dramatic cellular composition changes during menstrual cycles.

Method: Probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that leverages single-cell reference data to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, with detailed model structure, priors, and inference strategy.

Result: Revealed dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, identified cell-type-specific differential gene expression (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during secretory phase), and demonstrated robustness to reference mismatches and noise.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach provides principled inference of cellular dynamics in heterogeneous tissues, with biological significance for understanding endometrial function, potential clinical implications for fertility and disorders, and future integration with spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained offline policy optimization framework for contextual bandits that addresses group fairness by reducing reward disparities across groups while maintaining competitive overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline policy optimization in contextual bandits can unintentionally amplify reward disparities across groups, raising fairness concerns when resources are limited. The authors aim to address this issue by incorporating group-sensitive fairness constraints.

Method: A constrained offline policy optimization framework that introduces group-wise reward disparity constraints into off-policy gradient-based optimization. Uses doubly robust estimator for better estimation of group-wise reward disparities and provides convergence guarantees.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method effectively reduces reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses group fairness in offline contextual bandits by constraining reward disparities, providing a practical solution for fair policy learning from historical data.

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

TL;DR: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 rationales were tested for automated essay scoring using Kaggle ASAP data. Essay-based scoring generally outperformed rationale-based scoring, but rationale-based scoring improved accuracy for underrepresented score 0. Ensemble models combining essay and rationale scoring achieved the best performance with QWK of 0.870.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utilities of GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 generated rationales in automated essay scoring and compare their effectiveness against traditional essay-based scoring methods.

Method: Used Prompt 6 essays from 2012 Kaggle ASAP data, compared essay-based scoring with rationale-based scoring, and implemented ensemble modeling combining different scoring approaches.

Result: Essay-based scoring generally performed better with higher QWK, but rationale-based scoring improved F1 scores for underrepresented score 0. Ensemble of essay-based and both rationale-based scoring achieved best QWK of 0.870.

Conclusion: Rationale-based scoring can complement essay-based scoring, especially for underrepresented classes, and ensemble approaches combining both methods yield superior automated scoring performance.

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairAD is an efficient fair graph clustering method that uses algebraic distance-based affinity matrices and graph coarsening to achieve fairness while being up to 40x faster than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about machine learning model biases toward demographic groups motivate the need for fair graph clustering that ensures proportional representation of protected groups in clusters.

Method: Constructs affinity matrix using algebraic distance to impose fairness constraints, performs graph coarsening to find representative nodes, and solves constrained minimization for fair clustering solution.

Result: Experiments on modified stochastic block model and six public datasets show FairAD achieves fair clustering while being up to 40 times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: FairAD provides a computationally efficient solution for fair graph clustering that maintains fairness constraints while significantly improving speed over existing methods.

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

*Sein Kwon,Seulgi Baek,Hyunseo Yang,Youngwan Jo,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RelTune is a novel DBMS configuration tuning framework that models parameter dependencies using relational graphs and GNN embeddings, and introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization for more efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBMS tuning approaches ignore parameter dependencies, assume independent parameters, and use simplified parameter selection, limiting their ability to capture performance-sensitive interactions. Bayesian Optimization methods also suffer from unstable surrogate model predictions.

Method: RelTune represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performance-relevant semantics. It introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO) that combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity to high-performing configurations.

Result: Experimental results on multiple DBMSs and workloads show that RelTune achieves faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: RelTune effectively addresses limitations of existing DBMS tuning methods by modeling parameter dependencies and introducing hybrid optimization, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

*Tong Zhao,Jiacheng Li,Yuanchang Zhou,Guangming Tan,Weile Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptor 'E' for gradient-based optimizers that continues exploring landscape valleys after reaching local minima to find lower and flatter minima for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most optimizers stop at local minima, but these may not be the lowest or provide best generalization due to complex loss landscape geometry. There's a need to continue searching for potentially better minima.

Method: Proposes an adaptor 'E' that modifies gradient-based optimizers to continue exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses) even after reaching local minima.

Result: The adapted Lamb optimizer (ALTO) increases test accuracy by average 2.5% across various large-batch training tasks compared to state-of-the-art optimizer. Convergence proof provided for both convex and non-convex scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach increases likelihood of finding lower and flatter local minima associated with better generalization, potentially opening new research direction in optimization algorithm design.

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

### [122] [Adaptive Defense against Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Bayesian Data Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27172)
*Zixuan Hu,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Yongxian Wei,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS) is an adaptive defense strategy against harmful fine-tuning that uses Bayesian inference to learn safety attributes of data points without requiring attack simulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense strategies rely on attack simulation which is limited by bounded threat models and inability to anticipate unknown attacks, plus limited adaptability to varying attack settings.

Method: BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as Bayesian inference, learning posterior distribution of each data point's safety attribute conditioned on datasets. It constrains fine-tuning by weighting data with sampled safety attributes, and uses a neural scheduler for efficient transfer without retraining.

Result: Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: BDS provides an effective adaptive defense against harmful fine-tuning without requiring attack simulation, leveraging Bayesian inference to tailor defense to specific datasets.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

*Junfan Li,Shizhong Liao,Zenglin Xu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New polynomial-time algorithm for online sparse linear regression with k-sparse access, improving regret bounds under compatibility condition using Dantzig Selector with novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online sparse linear regression with limited attribute access is NP-hard, and previous algorithms required strong assumptions. Need better algorithms under weaker conditions.

Method: Leverages Dantzig Selector with algorithm-dependent covariance sampling, adaptive parameter tuning, and batching online Newton step with careful initialization.

Result: Significantly improves previous regret bounds under compatibility condition, with tighter convergence rate for l1-norm error. Also extends to additional observations setting.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm achieves better performance under weaker assumptions through novel techniques and analyses, advancing the state-of-the-art in online sparse linear regression.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

*Zongshun Zhang,Ibrahim Matta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SERFLOW is a system that dynamically offloads ML model partitions across FaaS and IaaS services, using stage-specific resource provisioning and adaptive load balancing to reduce cloud costs by over 23% while handling dynamic workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on ML model partitioning overlooks real-world factors like VM cold starts and long-tail service time distributions, leading to inefficient resource utilization and high costs when requests exit at different stages of the model.

Method: Models ML queries as traversing an acyclic sequence of stages, uses FaaS-based serverless functions with stage-specific resource provisioning based on exit rates, and implements adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless functions.

Result: Reduces cloud costs by over 23% while efficiently adapting to dynamic workloads, addressing the challenge of varying exit rates and request bursts in deep layers.

Conclusion: SERFLOW effectively balances processing and transmission delays while minimizing costs for adaptive inference applications by accounting for real-world factors and dynamic workload characteristics.

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accident prediction models fail to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks, while traffic accidents claim over 1.35 million lives annually worldwide.

Method: Developed MDAS-GNN with feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons, integrating three core risk dimensions.

Result: Achieved superior performance on UK Department for Transport data across multiple cities, maintaining low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods with particular strength in long-term forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework provides advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization and safety interventions in urban development.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

### [126] [Feature-Function Curvature Analysis: A Geometric Framework for Explaining Differentiable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27207)
*Hamed Najafi,Dongsheng Luo,Jason Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFCA introduces a 4D geometric signature for features and dynamic tracking of learning evolution, providing empirical evidence of hierarchical learning and practical diagnostics for model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream XAI methods provide incomplete static views of models, collapsing feature roles into single scores that are confounded by non-linearity and interactions.

Method: Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA) framework that analyzes model geometry, producing 4D signatures (Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, Interaction) and extends to Dynamic Archetype Analysis for tracking training evolution.

Result: First direct empirical evidence of hierarchical learning (simple linear effects before complex interactions), practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient capacity and predicting overfitting onset.

Conclusion: FFCA transforms model explanation from simple quantification to nuanced analysis of the entire learning process through geometric context in both static and dynamic components.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

### [127] [Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222)
*Jaebyeong Jeon,Hyeonseo Jang,Jy-yong Sohn,Kibok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR introduces a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts to capture shared or task-specific information, reducing redundant feature learning in joint invariant and equivariant representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current joint learning approaches for invariant and equivariant representations use separate projection heads but overlook shared information, leading to redundant feature learning and inefficient model capacity use.

Method: Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR) models projection heads as experts that specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, reducing redundancy between invariant and equivariant embeddings.

Result: STAR shows lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings and achieves consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: STAR effectively reduces redundant feature learning in joint invariant and equivariant representation learning by modeling projection heads as specialized experts.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

### [128] [FedSM: Robust Semantics-Guided Feature Mixup for Bias Reduction in Federated Learning with Long-Tail Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27240)
*Jingrui Zhang,Yimeng Xu,Shujie Li,Feng Liang,Haihan Duan,Yanjie Dong,Victor C. M. Leung,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSM is a client-centric federated learning framework that addresses model bias from non-IID and long-tail data distributions through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning suffers from biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions across decentralized clients.

Method: Uses pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute semantic relevance, guides category selection for local feature mixup with global prototypes to generate class-consistent pseudo-features, and performs lightweight classifier retraining with probabilistic category selection to handle domain shift.

Result: Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets show FedSM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FedSM effectively mitigates bias in federated learning through client-centric semantics-guided approach while maintaining computational efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

### [129] [Not All Instances Are Equally Valuable: Towards Influence-Weighted Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27253)
*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IWD is a dataset distillation framework that uses influence functions to prioritize beneficial data instances and downweight harmful ones, improving distilled dataset quality and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets contain both informative and harmful instances, but existing dataset distillation methods treat all instances equally, which can degrade model performance when distilling without considering data quality.

Method: IWD leverages influence functions to assign adaptive weights to each instance based on its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial data while downweighting less useful or harmful instances. It has a modular design that can be integrated into diverse dataset distillation frameworks.

Result: Empirical results show that integrating IWD improves the quality of distilled datasets and enhances model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%.

Conclusion: IWD provides a principled framework for incorporating data quality considerations into dataset distillation, leading to better performance by focusing on beneficial instances and reducing the impact of harmful ones.

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

*Xin Tang,Youfang Han,Fangfei Gou,Wei Zhao,Xin Meng,Yang Yu,Jinguo Zhang,Yuanchun Shi,Yuntao Wang,Tengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECVL-ROUTER is a scenario-aware routing framework for Vision-Language Models that dynamically selects between large cloud models and small edge models based on user requirements for response speed, quality, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User requirements vary across scenarios (fast response, high-quality output, low energy consumption), but relying solely on large cloud models leads to high latency and energy costs, while small edge models can handle simpler tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes ECVL-ROUTER with a new routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select appropriate models for each query. Also constructs a multimodal response-quality dataset for router training.

Result: Successfully routes over 80% of queries to the small model while incurring less than 10% drop in problem solving probability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages both large and small models by dynamically routing queries based on scenario requirements, achieving significant efficiency gains with minimal quality degradation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

### [131] [Higher-order Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27258)
*Yifan Zhang,Zhen Qin,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HLA (Higher-order Linear Attention) is a new attention mechanism that achieves linear-time computation while enabling higher-order interactions, addressing the quadratic cost limitation of traditional scaled dot-product attention in long-context language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic computational cost of scaled dot-product attention prevents scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Existing linear-time alternatives like SSMs are limited to first-order or kernel-based approximations, restricting their expressivity.

Method: HLA maintains constant-size prefix sufficient statistics to enable higher-order interactions. It computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing n×n matrices, uses closed-form streaming identities, includes a strictly causal masked variant, and employs chunk-parallel training via associative scans.

Result: HLA provides a principled, scalable building block that combines attention-like data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures, supporting extensions to third and higher orders.

Conclusion: HLA successfully bridges the gap between attention's expressivity and linear-time efficiency, offering a viable solution for scaling language models to long contexts while maintaining higher-order interaction capabilities.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

TL;DR: ODP-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance prediction that standardizes evaluation protocols and provides trained models for fair algorithm comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent evaluation protocols and limited coverage of real-world OOD datasets in existing literature, enabling better deployment of trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Proposed ODP-Bench benchmark that includes commonly used OOD datasets and existing performance prediction algorithms, providing trained models as a testbench to ensure consistent comparisons.

Result: Created a comprehensive benchmark with extensive experimental analyses to understand algorithm capability boundaries.

Conclusion: ODP-Bench provides a standardized framework for fair evaluation of OOD performance prediction algorithms and facilitates future research by eliminating the need to retrain models.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

*Minghui Li,Yuanhang Wang,Peijin Guo,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,Shengqing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiF-DTA is a hierarchical network for drug-target affinity prediction that extracts both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences, and models drugs at multiple scales (atomic, substructural, molecular) with fusion via multi-scale bilinear attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence-based deep learning methods for DTA prediction overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features, and represent drugs as flat sequences without multi-scale features, limiting prediction accuracy.

Method: Dual-pathway strategy to extract global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences; multi-scale drug modeling learning atomic, substructural, and molecular representations; multi-scale bilinear attention module for feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets; ablation studies confirm importance of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Conclusion: HiF-DTA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating global-local feature extraction and multi-scale drug modeling, achieving superior DTA prediction performance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

TL;DR: A novel approach combining mutual information analysis with deep learning to improve heart rate estimation by handling non-linear chaotic behavior, achieving up to 40% improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart rate oscillations are inherently complex and non-linear, presenting challenges for practical cardiovascular health monitoring in everyday life.

Method: Study non-linear chaotic behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel approach that combines mathematical chaos theory with deep learning solutions.

Result: Validated on four real-life datasets, the approach shows up to 40% improvement in heart rate estimation compared to traditional methods and existing machine-learning techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method substantially improves heart rate estimation while reducing reliance on multiple sensing modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in

*Rodrigo Matos Carnier,Laura Lahesoo,Kensuke Fukuda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares batch vs streaming learning for IoT anomaly detection, showing streaming methods handle concept drift better and are more computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional batch learning models struggle with concept drift and high maintenance in IoT networks, while streaming learning offers better adaptability and robustness.

Method: Simulated heterogeneous IoT network streams by mixing datasets, compared batch and streaming approaches, and evaluated tree-based vs non-tree-based ML algorithms.

Result: Streaming methods outperformed batch models - Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 with 1/3 computational cost, Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached 0.910 F1 with 4x cost reduction.

Conclusion: Streaming learning is superior for IoT anomaly detection due to handling concept drift and computational efficiency, though current datasets have limitations in exposing model weaknesses.

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces un-attributability as a measure of semantic novelty in language model outputs, using a two-stage retrieval pipeline to determine when outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language model outputs relate to pretraining data by inverting the traditional training data attribution question - instead of asking which examples influence outputs, asking which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining examples.

Method: A two-stage retrieval pipeline: first index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings to retrieve top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. Outputs are considered novel if the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models use pretraining data across longer spans than previously thought, (2) some domains systematically affect novelty, and (3) instruction tuning increases novelty beyond just style changes.

Conclusion: Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale, with released corpus chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

*Yu-Chen Kuo,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedM2T is a time-aware multimodal framework that handles medical data's multimodality and temporal heterogeneity through sparse time series encoding, hierarchical temporal fusion, and bi-modal attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on cardiovascular disease prediction, mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data presents challenges due to inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures, requiring specialized approaches to handle irregular time series and cross-modal interactions effectively.

Method: MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder for irregular/sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion for micro/macro-temporal patterns from dense time series like ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention for cross-modal interactions. Uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders with feature alignment in a shared encoder.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal frameworks and time series models on MIMIC-IV datasets: AUROC 0.947 and AUPRC 0.706 for CVD prediction; AUROC 0.901 and AUPRC 0.558 for mortality prediction; MAE 2.31 for LOS regression.

Conclusion: MedM2T demonstrates robustness and broad applicability in clinical prediction, positioning it as a promising tool for handling complex medical data with superior performance across multiple healthcare prediction tasks.

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

### [139] [Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338)
*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-trained language models using chain-of-thought reasoning often generate illegible reasoning processes while maintaining readable final answers, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if chain-of-thought reasoning can be effectively monitored to detect malicious behavior, which requires legible and faithful reasoning processes.

Method: Studied CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, analyzing how RL affects reasoning readability and testing accuracy when forced to use only legible portions.

Result: RL often causes reasoning to become illegible while maintaining perfect final answer readability. Accuracy drops by 53% when using only legible portions. Legibility degrades on harder questions with no correlation to performance when resampling.

Conclusion: Without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

### [140] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a holistic monitorability score combining faithfulness and verbosity to evaluate how well chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning serves as external working memory for AI safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring CoT faithfulness are limited, focusing only on cases where models change answers after cues, missing important aspects of reasoning transparency needed for effective safety monitoring.

Method: The authors introduce verbosity as a measure of whether CoT lists all factors needed to solve tasks, and combine it with faithfulness into a unified monitorability score. They evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU datasets.

Result: Models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they omit key factors, and monitorability differs significantly across model families.

Conclusion: The proposed monitorability score provides a more comprehensive evaluation of CoT's utility for safety monitoring, and the authors release evaluation code to support reproducible future work.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

### [141] [FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Junchao Zhou,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMuon is a federated learning optimizer that addresses client drift in non-IID settings through momentum aggregation and local-global alignment, achieving faster convergence with fewer communication rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods using element-wise optimizers (Adam/SGD) neglect geometric structure of weight matrices, amplifying pathological directions and leading to slow convergence. The Muon optimizer shows promise but causes client drift in non-IID settings.

Method: Proposes FedMuon with two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation - clients use aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment - aligning local gradients with global update direction to reduce client drift.

Result: Theoretically achieves linear speedup convergence rate without heterogeneity assumption. Empirically validated on language and vision models, significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedMuon effectively addresses client drift in non-IID FL settings through momentum aggregation and gradient alignment, enabling faster convergence with fewer communication rounds while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

*Bruno Puri,Jim Berend,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Atlas-Alignment transfers interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a pre-labeled Concept Atlas using lightweight representational alignment, enabling semantic feature search and steerable generation without costly model-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability pipelines are costly and difficult to scale, requiring expensive training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual labeling, and validation for each new model.

Method: Align unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas (labeled, human-interpretable latent space) using shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques.

Result: Enables semantic feature search/retrieval and steering generation along interpretable concepts without labeled concept data, with robust performance shown through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Amortizes the cost of explainable AI by allowing one high-quality Concept Atlas to make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

*Meenu Ravi,Shailik Sarkar,Yanshen Sun,Vaishnavi Singh,Chang-Tien Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVeLMA is a novel multimodal ML pipeline that predicts county-level vegetation loss after wildfires using ensemble methods and probabilistic modeling, outperforming existing approaches and providing confidence maps for targeted recovery efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss are time-consuming, lack comprehensive factor analysis, and suffer from poor interpretability, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses multimodal feature integration pipeline with stacked ensemble architecture and probabilistic modeling for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art and baseline models in predicting vegetation loss and generates confidence maps to identify high-risk counties.

Conclusion: The approach can significantly inform disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery management through improved predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Preservation Network is a new graph representation learning framework that creates reduced graphs as faithful proxies of the original, enabling efficient downstream tasks like community detection and influence propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, are constrained by fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing, limiting their effectiveness in modeling complex systems.

Method: Introduces two key components: Joint Graph Evolution layer (jointly transforms graph topology and node features adaptively) and Spectral Concordance loss (enforces consistency in spectral properties and node features).

Result: Superior performance in node-level sparsification compared to state-of-the-art methods, with clear advantages demonstrated in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed Spectral Preservation Network effectively overcomes limitations of traditional GNNs by enabling adaptive structure evolution and spectral preservation, providing faithful graph representations at reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

TL;DR: A method for learning and sampling from simplex distributions using Aitchison geometry and bijections to Euclidean space, with Dirichlet interpolation for categorical data modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable density modeling in Euclidean space while respecting the geometry of the simplex and supporting exact recovery of discrete distributions from categorical data.

Method: Maps the open simplex to Euclidean space via smooth bijections based on Aitchison geometry, using Dirichlet interpolation to dequantize discrete observations into continuous ones.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous methods using Riemannian geometry or custom noise processes.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables Euclidean space modeling while maintaining the geometric properties of the simplex and supporting exact discrete distribution recovery.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

### [146] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that studying single chain-of-thought (CoT) samples is inadequate for understanding model reasoning. Instead, they propose resampling methods to analyze distributions of CoTs for reliable causal analysis, model understanding, and principled interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing work only studies single chain-of-thought samples, which is insufficient for understanding causal influence and underlying computations in reasoning models that define distributions over many possible CoTs.

Method: The authors use resampling techniques to investigate model decisions through four case studies: measuring causal impact of specific sentences, comparing off-policy vs on-policy interventions, introducing resilience metrics to prevent content reappearance, and adapting causal mediation analysis for unfaithful CoTs.

Result: Key findings include: self-preservation sentences have small causal impact in blackmail scenarios; off-policy interventions yield small/unstable effects vs resampling; critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated; hints exert subtle cumulative influence even when removed.

Conclusion: Studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of model computations than single-sample analysis.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

### [147] [FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Kewen Zhu,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAdamW is a federated learning algorithm that adapts AdamW optimizer to address challenges in federated settings, including data heterogeneity, local overfitting, and slow convergence due to moment reinitialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying AdamW in federated learning faces challenges: high variance in second-moment estimates due to data heterogeneity, local overfitting causing client drift, and slow convergence from reinitializing moment estimates each round.

Method: FedAdamW uses local correction mechanism and decoupled weight decay to align local updates with global updates, aggregates mean of second-moment estimates to reduce variance, and reinitializes them efficiently.

Result: Theoretically proven linear speedup convergence rate without heterogeneity assumption. Empirically validated on language and vision Transformer models, showing significant reduction in communication rounds and improved test accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedAdamW effectively addresses key challenges of using AdamW in federated learning, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements for training large-scale models in federated settings.

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InertialAR is a Transformer-based autoregressive model for 3D molecule generation that achieves SE(3) and permutation invariance through canonical tokenization and geometric rotary positional encoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models have succeeded in text and images but face challenges in 3D molecule generation due to the need for SE(3) and permutation invariance, and handling hybrid atom tokens with both discrete types and continuous coordinates.

Method: InertialAR uses canonical tokenization by aligning molecules to inertial frames and reordering atoms, incorporates geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE) for geometric awareness, and employs hierarchical autoregressive prediction with atom type first then 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of 10 metrics for unconditional generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP, and significantly outperforms baselines in controllable generation for targeted functionality across all 5 metrics.

Conclusion: InertialAR successfully extends Transformer-based autoregressive models to 3D molecule generation by addressing fundamental challenges of invariant tokenization and geometric modeling, demonstrating superior performance in both unconditional and controllable generation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all
5 metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-FedPGN is a new Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning algorithm that uses global gradient norm penalty to find global flat minima, improving model generalization while providing privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CL-DPFL methods result in sharper loss landscapes and reduced model generalization after differential privacy protection. Local flatness from SAM doesn't reflect global flatness in CL-DPFL.

Method: Proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm introduces global gradient norm penalty to local loss to find global flat minimum. Uses Rényi DP for privacy guarantees and reduces locally updated norm to minimize gradient clipping error.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks on ResNet and Transformer models compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Eliminates impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence.

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by DP, finds flatter global minima, reduces gradient clipping error, and provides strict privacy guarantees while improving model performance.

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

*Zherui Yang,Zhehao Li,Kangbo Lyu,Yixuan Li,Tao Du,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based method using Graph Neural Networks to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners for conjugate gradient solvers, designed for GPU parallelization by avoiding triangular solves and requiring only two matrix-vector products per CG step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preconditioners have theoretical guarantees but limited ability to exploit data optimization. Existing learning-based methods using GNNs face challenges with triangular solves that hinder GPU parallelization and introduce hard-to-model long-range dependencies.

Method: Uses GNNs to construct SPAI preconditioners that avoid triangular solves, require only two matrix-vector products per CG step, and employs a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function matching CG's convergence properties.

Result: Outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based methods on GPUs, reducing solution time by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster) with better condition numbers and superior generalization on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based SPAI preconditioner using GNNs provides GPU-friendly, efficient preconditioning that avoids triangular solve bottlenecks, achieves significant speedups, and demonstrates strong generalization performance across various problem domains.

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

TL;DR: Foundation models pretrained on heterogeneous time series or synthetic data outperform EEG-specific models in EEG classification tasks like motor imagery and sleep stage prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether general-purpose time series foundation models can effectively transfer to domain-specific biomedical signals like EEG, despite being trained on non-neural or synthetic data.

Method: Tested two pretraining approaches: (1) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (2) pretraining on purely synthetic data. Applied these to EEG tasks including motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction.

Result: Both pretraining variants consistently outperformed EEGNet (convolutional baseline) and CBraMod (recent EEG-specific foundation model), demonstrating strong performance on EEG classification tasks.

Conclusion: Generalist time series foundation models can effectively transfer to EEG analysis, even when pretrained on non-neural or synthetic data, suggesting EEG can benefit from broader time series advances.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework combining domain adaptation and active learning for structural health monitoring that reduces required labeled data by improving unsupervised mappings with limited labeled target data and guiding inspections to most informative observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural health monitoring data is expensive to obtain, especially labeled data. Population-based SHM faces distribution shifts between structures, causing generalization errors. Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods don't incorporate online updates as labels become available during monitoring.

Method: Proposes Bayesian framework for domain adaptation in PBSHM that improves unsupervised mappings using limited labeled target data. Integrates with active sampling strategy to select most informative observations for labeling.

Result: Method evaluated on experimental bridges with multiple damage states and environmental conditions. Combining transfer learning and active learning improves data efficiency in label-scarce scenarios for classification models.

Conclusion: The approach enables data-informed operation and maintenance with reduced inspections over operational lifetime, leading to significant cost reductions in structural health monitoring.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

*Yuxiang Chen,Xiaoming Xu,Pengle Zhang,Michael Beyer,Martin Rapp,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TetraJet-v2 is a 4-bit fully-quantized training method using NVFP4 format that addresses weight oscillation and outlier issues, achieving near-lossless LLM training with 51.3% reduced performance gap to full-precision training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM training is prohibitively expensive, driving interest in low-precision fully-quantized training. While 4-bit formats like NVFP4 offer efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless training at such low precision remains challenging.

Method: End-to-end 4-bit FQT using NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients in all linear layers. Includes: 1) unbiased double-block quantization for NVFP4 linear layers, 2) OsciReset algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3) OutControl algorithm to retain outlier accuracy.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens. Reduces performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Conclusion: TetraJet-v2 successfully enables efficient 4-bit fully-quantized training for LLMs while maintaining near-lossless performance, addressing key challenges of weight oscillation and outliers in low-precision training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AstuteRAG-FQA is an adaptive RAG framework for financial question answering that addresses domain-specific challenges through hybrid retrieval, dynamic prompts, and multi-layered security while maintaining regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks but faces critical challenges in finance including restricted data access, limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data interpretation.

Method: Uses hybrid retrieval strategy with open-source and proprietary data, dynamic prompt framework adapting to query complexity, four-tier task classification system, multi-layered security mechanisms (differential privacy, anonymization, access controls), and real-time compliance monitoring.

Result: The framework systematically addresses diverse financial queries through optimized retrieval and generation processes, with evaluation of three data integration techniques (contextual embedding, small model augmentation, targeted fine-tuning) for efficiency across financial environments.

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA provides a comprehensive solution for financial question answering that balances performance with security and regulatory compliance requirements through adaptive RAG techniques.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

*Zhuohan Wang,Ziwei Zhu,Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Yizhou Han,Yufeng Lin,Zhihang Lin,Angyang Gu,Xinglin Hu,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORGEval is a graph-theoretic framework that evaluates LLMs' optimization formulation capabilities by representing models as graphs and using Weisfeiler-Lehman tests with symmetric decomposable detection for equivalence checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solver-based methods for evaluating LLMs' optimization formulation abilities face issues with inconsistency, infeasibility, and high computational costs, creating a need for robust evaluation metrics.

Method: Represents optimization models as graphs and reduces equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. Uses Weisfeiler-Lehman test with symmetric decomposable detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence structurally rather than numerically.

Result: ORGEval achieves 100% consistency across random parameter configurations and significantly outperforms solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Applied to Bench4Opt dataset, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 show highest accuracies.

Conclusion: ORGEval provides a robust, efficient framework for evaluating LLMs' optimization modeling capabilities, revealing that while optimization modeling remains challenging, some LLMs perform well under direct prompting.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

*Sivaraman Balakrishnan,Nika Haghtalab,Daniel Hsu,Brian Lee,Eric Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces panprediction, a framework that generalizes omniprediction and multi-group learning by enabling models to minimize many losses on many downstream tasks simultaneously, with efficient sample complexity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond classical supervised learning that minimizes a single fixed loss function on a fixed distribution, and instead develop models that can extract sufficient information from data to handle multiple losses across multiple downstream tasks.

Method: Develops mathematical framework for panprediction and designs algorithms for deterministic and randomized panpredictors with sample complexities of Õ(1/ε³) and Õ(1/ε²) respectively, using a reduction to step calibration.

Result: Shows that under mild assumptions, simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Improves deterministic omniprediction sample complexity by factor 1/ε.

Conclusion: Panprediction provides a unified framework that generalizes existing paradigms and demonstrates efficient statistical complexity for handling multiple losses and tasks simultaneously.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in machine learning leads to unreliable classification performance, with existing methods focusing on data or loss reweighting but overlooking how imbalance amplifies Clever Hans effects through underspecification of minority classes.

Method: A counterfactual explanations-based approach using Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate Clever Hans effects that emerge under class imbalance conditions.

Result: The method achieves competitive classification performance on three datasets and demonstrates how Clever Hans effects emerge under imbalance.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel perspective on class imbalance by focusing on Clever Hans effects, which has been largely overlooked by existing approaches.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three

*Shuyan Lyu,Zhanzimo Wu,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel layer-wise training approach using deterministic information bottleneck and Rényi's entropy to train deep neural networks without backpropagation, achieving performance comparable to SGD while being more biologically plausible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN training with global cross-entropy loss and backpropagation is biologically implausible, requires storing intermediate outputs, and suffers from vanishing/exploding gradients. Layer-wise training offers an alternative but has been limited to small datasets and simple architectures.

Method: Systematic analysis of CNN training dynamics reveals layer-by-layer convergence and Markov information bottleneck principle. Proposed method uses deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and matrix-based Rényi's entropy, training each layer with auxiliary classifiers to learn minimal sufficient task-relevant representations.

Result: Empirical validation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and traffic sign recognition shows the approach outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines and achieves performance comparable to SGD training.

Conclusion: The proposed layer-wise training method based on information bottleneck principles provides a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation that maintains competitive performance while reducing memory usage and gradient issues.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

*Alireza Saleh Abadi,Leen-Kiat Soh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how openness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (agent turnover, evolving tasks, changing agent types) disrupts traditional credit assignment methods, causing performance degradation through credit misattribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of dynamic agent populations, evolving tasks, and changing agent capabilities on credit assignment in multi-agent systems, as traditional methods assume static environments.

Method: Conceptual analysis introducing new openness sub-categories, followed by empirical study using temporal and structural algorithms in open environments.

Result: Openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: Traditional credit assignment methods are inadequate for open systems due to broken assumptions about environmental stationarity and fixed team composition.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATArena is a tournament-style evaluation platform using board/card games to continuously assess LLM agent learning capabilities, addressing score saturation in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agents have limitations: they assess fixed scenarios, suffer from score saturation, and require expert annotation as capabilities improve. There's a need to evaluate learning ability as a core driver for agent evolution.

Method: Proposed an iterative competitive peer-learning framework where agents refine strategies through repeated interactions and feedback. Created CATArena with four diverse board/card games featuring open-ended scoring without upper limits.

Result: Experimental results with minimal and commercial code agents show CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.

Conclusion: CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities, effectively addressing the score saturation problem in current benchmarks while focusing on learning ability as key to agent evolution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that decompresses scientific reasoning by creating verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge bases, which power an encyclopedia called SciencePedia through retrieval and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific materials often compress reasoning by presenting conclusions without derivational chains, which hinders verification and inhibits cross-domain connections by collapsing logical pathways.

Method: Uses a Socratic agent guided by 200 courses to generate 3 million first-principles questions. Multiple solver models create LCoTs, which are filtered through prompt sanitization and cross-model consensus. Verified LCoTs power a Brainstorm Search Engine that retrieves derivations, feeding the Plato synthesizer to create coherent articles.

Result: SciencePedia contains 200,000 entries across six disciplines. Plato-synthesized articles show higher knowledge-point density and lower factual error rates than baseline approaches without retrieval.

Conclusion: This reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia built on verifiable LCoT knowledge bases.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational Models in cyber-physical systems introduce new error types (hallucinations, overgeneralizations, context misalignments) that lead to incorrect decisions, requiring new safety mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Cognition Envelopes as reasoning boundaries to constrain AI-generated decisions, complementing meta-cognition and traditional safety envelopes.

Result: Concept introduced but requires practical guidelines and systematic processes for definition, validation, and assurance similar to safety envelopes.

Conclusion: Cognition Envelopes are needed to address novel error types from foundational models in cyber-physical systems, requiring systematic development processes.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal masking on spatial chess board data produces stronger playing models than sequential move-based training, challenging traditional assumptions about masking in nonsequential domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether causal masking is viable for nonsequential spatial data, using chess as a test domain that supports both spatial and sequential representations.

Method: Trained language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) chess data.

Result: Models trained on spatial board states with causal masking consistently achieved stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data.

Conclusion: Applying causal masking to spatial data is viable for training unimodal LLMs and can be preferable to sequentialization in some domains.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

Motivation: Users need fine-grained control over AI reasoning effort to balance output quality versus latency/cost, but existing methods require knowing problem difficulty beforehand to set token budgets.

Result: Achieves approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance across model scales from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves.

Conclusion: The approach enables dynamic cost-accuracy trade-off control, eliminates dataset-specific tuning, and automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to task difficulty.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Implementation of a MAPE-driven data flywheel in NVIDIA's enterprise AI agent that uses human feedback to continuously improve RAG pipeline performance through targeted fine-tuning, achieving significant accuracy gains and latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise AI agents need continuous adaptation to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and align with user needs, requiring systematic approaches to address failures and enable continuous learning.

Method: Built a closed-loop MAPE-driven data flywheel system that collects negative feedback samples, analyzes failure modes (routing and query rephrasal errors), and implements targeted improvements using NVIDIA NeMo microservices for fine-tuning.

Result: Reduced routing model size by 10x (from 70B to 8B) while achieving 96% accuracy and 70% latency improvement; improved query rephrasal by 3.7% accuracy and 40% latency reduction; processed 495 negative samples over 3 months.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop feedback structured within a data flywheel transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems, providing a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive AI agents that learn from real-world usage at scale.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: LLMs can now solve most IMO problems but struggle with grading proofs accurately. The paper introduces agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and create problem-specific rubrics to improve proof grading consistency and agreement with human scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SOTA LLMs can solve most IMO problems, their ability to grade proofs - detecting errors, judging severity, and assigning fair partial credit - remains limited and poorly calibrated.

Method: Used 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on 1-4 scale with error annotations, and MathArena IMO/USAMO 2025 solutions on 0-7 scale. Introduced agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading.

Result: Models can reliably flag incorrect solutions but show calibration gaps in partial credit assignment. The proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows with problem-specific rubrics significantly improve LLM-based proof grading, addressing calibration issues and achieving better alignment with human evaluation standards.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI can autonomously design computer system mechanisms with creativity and reasoning comparable to human experts, moving beyond black-box optimization approaches.

Method: Uses large language models in a human-inspired multi-agent workflow where specialized agents handle reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback.

Result: Produced new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling in distributed GPU clusters for LLM inference that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior.

Conclusion: Combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation enables AI to produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems, suggesting a path toward autonomous system design.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured

TL;DR: This paper proposes a practical framework for System of Systems (SoS) lifecycle management that integrates MBSE, PLM, CAD-CAE, digital thread and digital twin to address challenges in networked product development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear life cycle models are inadequate for modern networked systems where interoperability, variant management, traceability, and cross-organizational governance are critical.

Method: Proposes a reference framework combining MBSE as semantic backbone, PLM for governance, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread/twin for continuous feedback. Identifies four principles: referenced architecture, end-to-end configuration sovereignty, curated models with review gates, and measurable value contributions.

Result: Developed a three-step roadmap for transitioning from product-centric to network-centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling across variants and supply chains, and organizational anchoring. Results include increased change robustness, shorter throughput times, improved reuse, and better sustainability decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework helps decision-makers manage complexity and design scalable SoS value streams by making networked system development more manageable and efficient.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a fine-grained, instance-tailored steering framework for LLM personalization that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them during forward pass, addressing limitations of existing methods in handling dynamic user patterns and data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing personalization methods (parametric adaptation, fine-tuning, reward modeling) in handling dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity scenarios due to low adaptability and data efficiency.

Method: Fine-grained steering framework with two innovations: 1) fine-grained steering component that hooks activations from attention and MLP layers to capture nuanced signals, 2) input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes signals into contextually relevant enhancements. Works as plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios (short-to-long text generation, web function calling) show significant enhancement of personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates high flexibility, data efficiency, and compatibility with existing techniques, effectively addressing challenges in dynamic user patterns and data sparsity scenarios for LLM personalization.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

TL;DR: GUI-Rise is a reasoning-enhanced framework for GUI navigation agents that integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization to improve cross-domain generalization and history utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI navigation face limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization, requiring a more systematic approach.

Conclusion: The framework effectively maintains robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks, validating the integration of structured reasoning with history-aware objectives.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

*Kristina Levina,Nikolaos Pappas,Athanasios Karapantelakis,Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces three generalizations of reward machines to address limitations in handling long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks, and presents a new compositional learning algorithm called CoRM that scales better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward machines help RL agents learn more efficiently from fewer samples for complex non-Markovian tasks, but they struggle with long-horizon problems where subtasks can be executed in any order, leading to exponential growth in learning requirements.

Method: Proposed three RM generalizations: (1) Numeric RMs for compact task expression, (2) Agenda RMs with agenda-tracking states, (3) Coupled RMs with coupled states per subtask. Introduced CoRM algorithm for compositional learning using coupled RMs.

Result: Experiments show that CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generalizations of reward machines and the CoRM algorithm effectively address the scalability limitations of traditional RMs for complex long-horizon problems involving unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

*Ali Norouzifar,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an outcome-aware process discovery approach that learns discriminative rules to separate desirable and undesirable process executions, then applies process discovery separately to each group to create focused, interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process discovery creates single models that fail to capture critical behavioral differences between desirable and undesirable executions, making them poorly suited for conformance checking and performance analysis.

Method: Learn interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features to group traces by desirability, then apply process discovery separately within each group to create focused models.

Result: The approach effectively isolates and visualizes critical process patterns, revealing drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions, and is implemented as a publicly available tool.

Conclusion: Outcome-aware process discovery with discriminative grouping produces more interpretable and focused models that better capture behavioral differences between desirable and undesirable process executions.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

TL;DR: This paper reassesses claims about LLMs contributing to mathematical discovery in bin packing problems, finding the generated heuristics are opaque and proposing simpler, more interpretable algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate recent claims that LLMs can provide meaningful contributions to mathematical discovery, specifically in online bin packing problems.

Method: Detailed analysis of LLM-generated heuristics, examination of their interpretability, and development of new tailored algorithms for specific bin packing instances.

Result: LLM-generated heuristics remain largely opaque even to experts. The authors developed simpler, more efficient, interpretable, and generalizable algorithms that outperform the LLM-generated ones.

Conclusion: Claims about LLMs' mathematical contributions rest on mistaken assumptions about problem complexity. Rigorous validation and contextualization are needed when assessing LLM-generated scientific outputs.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

TL;DR: ToolScope is an agentic framework that unifies global planning with local multimodal perception to help MLLMs flexibly use external tools for complex VQA tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning due to the complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, especially in long-horizon VQA tasks.

Method: ToolScope framework with three components: Global Navigator (strategic guidance), Agentic Executor (iterative local perception with Search, Code, and Perceive tools), and Response Synthesizer (organizing outputs).

Result: Achieved average performance improvement of +6.69% across four VQA benchmarks (VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search, MathVista), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively addresses visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA tasks by unifying global planning with local multimodal perception through specialized tool integration.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

*Yueyang Wang,Mehmet Dogar,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with visual and motor constraints outperforms existing methods for modeling pedestrian-driver interactions, producing more realistic behaviors without requiring large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pedestrian-driver interaction models lack flexibility and overlook sensory/motor constraints that shape human perception and action in interactive scenarios.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with four variants: no constraints, motor constraints only, visual constraints only, and combined constraints. Uses real-world dataset from unsignalised pedestrian crossing.

Result: Combined model with both visual and motor constraints performed best. Motor constraints produced smoother human-like movements, while visual constraints introduced perceptual uncertainty leading to more cautious behavior. Outperformed supervised behavioral cloning in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: Multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising approach for simulating realistic road user interactions, accounting for individual differences through population-level parameter distributions.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

TL;DR: Proposes Nous, an AI agent that actively probes users to resolve intent uncertainty using information theory principles, achieving efficient human-AI collaboration without human preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'intention expression gap' where humans struggle to convey complex thoughts to AI, leading to inefficient trial-and-error loops, especially problematic for users with diverse expertise levels.

Method: Train Nous using an information theory framework where information gain from dialogue serves as intrinsic reward, equivalent to reducing Shannon entropy over task space. Uses automated simulation pipeline to generate large-scale dataset for scientific diagram generation.

Result: Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, remains robust to varying user expertise, and shows generalization beyond diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving user intent uncertainty in complex human-AI collaboration, moving from passive instruction following to active Socratic collaboration.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepCompress is a framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models by adaptively adjusting reasoning path lengths based on problem difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that optimize for efficiency through SFT or RL with token-length rewards often sacrifice accuracy. LRMs suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones.

Method: Uses adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as 'Simple' or 'Hard' in real-time. Encourages shorter reasoning for simple problems and longer exploratory thought chains for hard problems through dual-reward strategy.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on challenging mathematical benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Conclusion: DeepCompress enables models to autonomously adjust CoT length, compressing reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for challenging ones, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

*Yuhao Zhang,Dingxin Hu,Tinghao Yu,Hao Liu,Yiting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFM is a novel method for synthesizing geometric data using formal languages and symbolic engines to generate diverse, high-fidelity geometric problems, significantly improving MLLMs' performance on geometric reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to scarce high-quality geometric data, and existing synthetic data generation methods produce limited, noisy data that lacks diversity and authenticity.

Method: GeoFM uses formal languages to explore condition combinations in metric space and generates geometrically correct problems through a symbolic engine, creating diverse and authentic geometric diagrams.

Result: Models trained with GeoFM data outperform GPT-4o by 18.7% on MathVista and 16.5% on GeoQA, and exceed leading open-source models by 5.7% on MathVista and 2.7% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: GeoFM effectively addresses geometric data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic data that significantly enhances MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

### [181] [Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544)
*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench is a formally verifiable diagnostic benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning through temporal trace evaluation (TTE) and temporal causal evaluation (TCE), revealing significant performance drops as reasoning complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning evaluation methods have limitations - ad-hoc datasets may contain bias and lack verifiability, while formal systems like Lean don't capture real-world agentic decision chains, creating a gap in reasoning benchmarks.

Method: TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks: TTE tests LLMs' ability to understand and simulate multi-step reasoning systems, and TCE tests multi-step causal reasoning and cause-effect relation extraction from complex systems.

Result: Models scored 65.6% on TCE-normal but only 7.5% on TCE-hard, showing that while state-of-the-art LLMs understand the task, their performance dramatically decreases as system complexity increases.

Conclusion: TempoBench provides a formally grounded framework to systematically analyze LLM reasoning capabilities, revealing significant limitations in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks despite basic understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our
\href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMA is a multi-agent framework that enhances mathematical reasoning by orchestrating specialized agents for independent reasoning, targeted searches, and knowledge synthesis, achieving 7.4% performance improvement on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented models rely on single perspectives, inflexible search strategies, and struggle to combine information from multiple sources effectively for mathematical reasoning.

Method: SIGMA uses a unified framework with specialized agents that independently reason, perform targeted searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic perspective.

Result: SIGMA consistently outperforms both open- and closed-source systems on MATH500, AIME, and GPQA benchmarks, achieving 7.4% absolute performance improvement.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InnovatorBench is a new benchmark for evaluating AI agents in realistic LLM research tasks, paired with ResearchGym environment. Experiments show frontier models struggle with algorithm tasks and long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent benchmarks are too narrow and simplified, failing to assess end-to-end scientific research capabilities needed for accelerating discovery.

Method: Created InnovatorBench with 20 research tasks across 6 categories, plus ResearchGym environment with rich action spaces and distributed execution. Tested with ReAct agent using frontier models.

Result: Frontier models show promise in code tasks but struggle with algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making. Agents take over 11 hours to achieve best performance.

Conclusion: InnovatorBench demonstrates high difficulty and potential to become the next generation code-based research benchmark for evaluating AI agents in realistic scientific settings.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

### [184] [VeriMoA: A Mixture-of-Agents Framework for Spec-to-HDL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27617)
*Heng Ping,Arijit Bhattacharjee,Peiyu Zhang,Shixuan Li,Wei Yang,Anzhe Cheng,Xiaole Zhang,Jesse Thomason,Ali Jannesari,Nesreen Ahmed,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriMoA is a training-free mixture-of-agents framework for RTL design automation that improves HDL generation through quality-guided caching and multi-path generation strategies, achieving 15-30% Pass@1 improvements without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for HDL generation face limitations in parametric knowledge and domain constraints, while existing multi-agent methods suffer from noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration.

Method: Proposes VeriMoA with two innovations: 1) quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain and rank all intermediate HDL outputs, enabling knowledge accumulation; 2) multi-path generation using C++ and Python as intermediate representations for two-stage specification-to-HDL translation.

Result: Achieves 15-30% improvements in Pass@1 across VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks, enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without training costs.

Conclusion: VeriMoA provides an effective training-free paradigm for HDL generation that enhances reasoning through collaborative multi-agent generation while promoting solution diversity and knowledge accumulation.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

### [185] [Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623)
*Qiusi Zhan,Hyeonjeong Ha,Rui Yang,Sirui Xu,Hanyang Chen,Liang-Yan Gui,Yu-Xiong Wang,Huan Zhang,Heng Ji,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAT is a framework for injecting visual backdoor attacks into MLLM-based embodied agents using environmental objects as triggers, achieving up to 80% attack success while maintaining normal task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM-based embodied agents create new security vulnerabilities through visual backdoor attacks, where agents behave normally until a visual trigger appears, then persistently execute attacker-specified malicious policies.

Method: BEAT uses a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL), which treats trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs to sharpen decision boundaries.

Result: BEAT achieves up to 80% attack success rates across various benchmarks and MLLMs, maintains strong benign task performance, and generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements. CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy by up to 39% compared to naive SFT.

Conclusion: The research exposes critical security risks in MLLM-based embodied agents and underscores the urgent need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

*Sebastian Benthall,Andrew Clark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic AI is defined as a software delivery mechanism that autonomously operates applications in complex enterprise settings, with validity being the key requirement rather than reliance on LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear definition of Agentic AI and emphasize that validation by end users is more important than the underlying foundation models like LLMs.

Method: Proposes a realist definition of Agentic AI as a software delivery mechanism comparable to SaaS, and discusses the importance of validation tools and techniques for end users.

Result: The analysis shows that with proper validation measures, simpler and more interpretable models can often replace foundation models like LLMs in Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: Validity is the primary requirement for Agentic AI systems, and LLMs are just one possible option among many that can achieve this goal.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Apollo is a human-in-the-loop sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level filtering to train LLM agents on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLM agents on long-horizon tasks are either too expensive (behavior cloning) or ineffective (outcome-driven sampling). There's a need for a more efficient approach that can handle tasks taking days or months.

Method: Apollo allows human annotators to intervene only when agents drift from promising trajectories, providing prior knowledge and strategic advice. It uses supervision control to filter sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation, enabling sustained 30+ hour interactions.

Result: When applied to train GLM-4.5 on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieved over 50% improvement over untrained baseline and 28% improvement over a variant without human interaction.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop sampling is critical for long-horizon tasks, and Apollo's design effectively handles domain-specialized challenges while reducing training costs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

TL;DR: MolChord is a novel SBDD approach that aligns protein and molecule structures with textual descriptions using NatureLM and diffusion encoders, and optimizes molecular properties through DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties in structure-based drug design.

Method: Integrates NatureLM (autoregressive model unifying text, molecules, and proteins) as molecule generator with diffusion-based structure encoder, and uses Direct Preference Optimization with property-aware dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark across key evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential as a practical tool for structure-based drug design by effectively aligning structural representations and optimizing molecular properties.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.

TL;DR: UP2D is a source-free domain adaptation framework for medical image segmentation that addresses noisy pseudo-labels and class imbalance through uncertainty-aware denoising, selective teacher updates, and entropy minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation models suffer severe performance degradation under domain shifts, especially when source images cannot be accessed due to data sharing constraints.

Method: UP2D integrates three components: Refined Prototype Filtering to suppress uninformative regions and build reliable class prototypes, Uncertainty-Guided EMA for selective teacher model updates based on boundary uncertainty, and quantile-based entropy minimization to focus learning on ambiguous regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three retinal fundus benchmarks show UP2D achieves state-of-the-art performance in both standard and open-domain settings, outperforming prior UDA and SFDA approaches with superior boundary precision.

Conclusion: UP2D's single-stage student-teacher framework progressively improves pseudo-label quality and reduces confirmation bias, making it effective for source-free domain adaptation in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models face severe performance drops under domain
shifts, especially when data sharing constraints prevent access to source
images. We present a novel Uncertainty-aware Progressive Pseudo-label Denoising
(UP2D) framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), designed to mitigate
noisy pseudo-labels and class imbalance during adaptation. UP2D integrates
three key components: (i) a Refined Prototype Filtering module that suppresses
uninformative regions and constructs reliable class prototypes to denoise
pseudo-labels, (ii) an Uncertainty-Guided EMA (UG-EMA) strategy that
selectively updates the teacher model based on spatially weighted boundary
uncertainty, and (iii) a quantile-based entropy minimization scheme that
focuses learning on ambiguous regions while avoiding overconfidence on easy
pixels. This single-stage student-teacher framework progressively improves
pseudo-label quality and reduces confirmation bias. Extensive experiments on
three challenging retinal fundus benchmarks demonstrate that UP2D achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both standard and open-domain settings,
outperforming prior UDA and SFDA approaches while maintaining superior boundary
precision.

Motivation: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance, limiting deep learning model effectiveness in clinical applications like human embryo time-lapse imaging.

Method: Systematic experiments with R3GAN using effective training strategies including full burn-in phase and low gradually increasing gamma range (5→40) for 256x256-resolution datasets.

Result: Generated samples balanced imbalanced embryo dataset, increasing recall and F1-score of t3 from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11 to 0.60 respectively without compromising other classes.

Conclusion: Tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance,
limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications.
Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work
investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for
small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images.
Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training
strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution
datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma
range (5 -> 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced
embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification
performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11
to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results
demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate
data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging
tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study presents three DDPMs for generating 3D T1-weighted MRI brain images using 80,675 volumes from 42,406 subjects across 38 datasets. The models preserve visual variability by avoiding registration and bias field correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain MRI data without skullstripping or registration, enabling generation of images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity.

Method: Three DDPMs were trained on minimally preprocessed brain MRI data. Images were not registered to common coordinates or bias field corrected. Evaluation included segmentation, FID, and qualitative inspection.

Result: All DDPMs generated coherent MR brain volumes. Velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs than sample prediction model, but all had higher FIDs than real images. Generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from real data.

Conclusion: Despite statistical differences from real data, the presented DDPMs can generate high-resolution 3D T1-weighted brain images. This represents the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain data without skullstripping or registration.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain
images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406
subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had
approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three
human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and
excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the
visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce
images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were
neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected.
Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and
qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent
MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs
than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs
compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment,
the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from
real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer
statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In
conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion
model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the
negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of
generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images. All model weights

*Mingcui Zhang,Zhigang Jia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a fragile zero-watermarking model using dual quaternion matrix decomposition for medical image copyright protection and tampering detection without modifying original images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images face risks of copyright infringement and content tampering during transmission and sharing, requiring effective protection methods that preserve image integrity.

Method: Uses dual quaternion matrix decomposition to correlate original carrier images with watermark images through operational relationships between standard and dual parts of dual quaternions.

Result: Generates zero-watermarking information that enables copyright protection and content tampering detection for medical images.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides an effective approach for protecting medical images through zero-watermarking technology while maintaining image integrity.

Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
tampering detection for medical images.

*Anssi Manninen,Janek Gröhl,Felix Lucka,Andreas Hauptmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes model-based learned iterative methods for Quantitative Photoacoustic Tomography (QPAT) that combine deep learning with iterative optimization approaches to achieve accurate reconstructions with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PAT reconstruction methods are computationally slow and require sufficient prior information, while deep learning methods need large training datasets which are often unavailable in practice.

Method: Adopts model-based learned iterative approach using gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, and Quasi-Newton methods with greedy and end-to-end training strategies.

Result: The methods are tested on both ideal simulated data and digital twin datasets that simulate scarce training data and high modeling errors.

Conclusion: Model-based learned iterative approaches provide better generalizability for QPAT with limited training data compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a medical imaging modality that can provide
high-resolution tissue images based on the optical absorption. Classical
reconstruction methods for quantifying the absorption coefficients rely on
sufficient prior information to overcome noisy and imperfect measurements. As
these methods utilize computationally expensive forward models, the computation
becomes slow, limiting their potential for time-critical applications. As an
alternative approach, deep learning-based reconstruction methods have been
established for faster and more accurate reconstructions. However, most of
these methods rely on having a large amount of training data, which is not the
case in practice. In this work, we adopt the model-based learned iterative
approach for the use in Quantitative PAT (QPAT), in which additional
information from the model is iteratively provided to the updating networks,
allowing better generalizability with scarce training data. We compare the
performance of different learned updates based on gradient descent,
Gauss-Newton, and Quasi-Newton methods. The learning tasks are formulated as
greedy, requiring iterate-wise optimality, as well as end-to-end, where all
networks are trained jointly. The implemented methods are tested with ideal
simulated data as well as against a digital twin dataset that emulates scarce
training data and high modeling error.

*Ruibo Shang,Matthew Thompson,Matthew D. Carson,Eric J. Seibel,Matthew O'Donnell,Ivan Pelivanov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Combining NIRF with fast-sweep PAUS imaging extends tumor detection depth from ~5mm to ~34mm, enabling comprehensive pre- and intra-operative guidance for wide-margin tumor excision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIRF imaging has limitations for wide-margin tumor excision due to sensitivity and resolution issues at depths beyond ~5mm in tissue.

Method: Used fast-sweep photoacoustic-ultrasound (PAUS) imaging to complement NIRF, tested with tozuleristide contrast agent in dark-red bovine muscle tissue in vitro.

Result: PAUS identified tozuleristide at 20 uM concentration from background at depths up to ~34mm, significantly extending NIRF capabilities. Laser-fluence compensation and clutter suppression improved spectroscopic accuracy and detection limits.

Conclusion: The combined NIRF-PAUS approach shows promise for comprehensive pre-operative (PA) and intra-operative (NIRF) solid tumor detection and wide-margin excision in optically guided surgery.

Abstract: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) can deliver high-contrast, video-rate,
non-contact imaging of tumor-targeted contrast agents with the potential to
guide surgeries excising solid tumors. However, it has been met with skepticism
for wide-margin excision due to sensitivity and resolution limitations at
depths larger than ~5 mm in tissue. To address this limitation, fast-sweep
photoacoustic-ultrasound (PAUS) imaging is proposed to complement NIRF. In an
exploratory in vitro feasibility study using dark-red bovine muscle tissue, we
observed that PAUS scanning can identify tozuleristide, a clinical stage
investigational imaging agent, at a concentration of 20 uM from the background
at depths of up to ~34 mm, highly extending the capabilities of NIRF alone. The
capability of spectroscopic PAUS imaging was tested by direct injection of 20
uM tozuleristide into bovine muscle tissue at a depth of ~ 8 mm. It is shown
that laser-fluence compensation and strong clutter suppression enabled by the
unique capabilities of the fast-sweep approach greatly improve spectroscopic
accuracy and the PA detection limit, and strongly reduce image artifacts. Thus,
the combined NIRF-PAUS approach can be promising for comprehensive pre- (with
PA) and intra- (with NIRF) operative solid tumor detection and wide-margin
excision in optically guided solid tumor surgery.

*Karin Olthof,Theo Ruers,Tiziano Natali,Lisanne Venix,Jasper Smit,Anne den Hartor,Niels Kok,Matteo Fusaglia,Koert Kuhlmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An ultrasound-based navigation system for open liver surgery that uses intraoperative 3D models instead of preoperative imaging registration, achieving median accuracy of 3.2mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simpler and more accurate navigation system for liver surgery that eliminates the need for registration to preoperative imaging by using intraoperative ultrasound data.

Method: Pilot study with 25 patients using electromagnetic sensor for motion compensation, intraoperative ultrasound volume acquisition, automatic vasculature segmentation, semi-automatic tumor segmentation (region-growing or deep learning), and real-time visualization of 3D models with tracked surgical instruments.

Result: Navigation successfully established in all 20 patients, median accuracy of 3.2mm [IQR: 2.8-4.8mm], R0 resection achieved in 93.8% of patients, workflow operational within 5-10 minutes.

Conclusion: Intraoperative ultrasound-based navigation is feasible and accurate for liver surgery, providing a registration-free approach that enables simpler and more accurate image guidance systems.

Abstract: Purpose: This proof-of-concept study evaluates feasibility and accuracy of an
ultrasound-based navigation system for open liver surgery. Unlike most
conventional systems that rely on registration to preoperative imaging, the
proposed system provides navigation-guided resection using 3D models generated
from intraoperative ultrasound.
  Methods: A pilot study was conducted in 25 patients undergoing resection of
liver metastases. The first five cases served to optimize the workflow.
Intraoperatively, an electromagnetic sensor compensated for organ motion, after
which an ultrasound volume was acquired. Vasculature was segmented
automatically and tumors semi-automatically using region-growing (n=15) or a
deep learning algorithm (n=5). The resulting 3D model was visualized alongside
tracked surgical instruments. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the distance
between surgical clips and tumors in the navigation software with the same
distance on a postoperative CT of the resected specimen.
  Results: Navigation was successfully established in all 20 patients. However,
four cases were excluded from accuracy assessment due to intraoperative sensor
detachment (n=3) or incorrect data recording (n=1). The complete navigation
workflow was operational within 5-10 minutes. In 16 evaluable patients, 78
clip-to-tumor distances were analyzed. The median navigation accuracy was 3.2
mm [IQR: 2.8-4.8 mm], and an R0 resection was achieved in 15/16 (93.8%)
patients and one patient had an R1 vascular resection.
  Conclusion: Navigation based solely on intra-operative ultrasound is feasible
and accurate for liver surgery. This registration-free approach paves the way
for simpler and more accurate image guidance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are unsuitable for computational imaging due to high computational cost and incompatibility with modern machine learning-based image priors.

Method: Combines Bayesian cross-validation with data fission (randomized measurement splitting) to evaluate models without ground truth. Compatible with various Bayesian imaging samplers including diffusion and plug-and-play methods.

Result: Achieves excellent model selection and misspecification detection accuracy with low computational cost across various scoring rules and types of model misspecification.

Conclusion: Provides a general, efficient methodology for unsupervised model evaluation in Bayesian imaging sciences that addresses limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.

Method: Established mathematical directivity model for uniform rectangular arrays, derived analytical expression for maximum directivity, and performed systematic analysis with numerical simulations.

Result: Directivity can be significantly enhanced through rational utilization of coupling effects, but enhancement yields diminishing returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundation for superdirective URA design and valuable guidance for holographic array optimization in next-generation communication systems.

Abstract: This paper studies the superdirectivity characteristics of uniform

analytical expression for the maximum directivity is derived. Accordingly,
systematic analysis is performed in conjunction with numerical simulations.
Results show that the directivity can be significantly enhanced via rational
utilization of coupling effects. However, this enhancement yields diminishing
returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales. This

### [198] [Joint optimization of microphone array geometry, sensor directivity pattern, and beamforming parameters for linear superarrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26822)
*Yuanhang Qian,Xueqin Luo,Jilu Jin,Gongping Huang,Jingdong Chen,Jacob Benesty*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A generalized optimization framework for linear superarrays that jointly optimizes array geometry, element directivity, and beamforming filters to minimize beampattern approximation error across frequencies and steering directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear superarrays have limited steering capability because they don't jointly optimize critical parameters like array geometry and element directivity, which are essential for beamforming performance.

Method: Uses Jacobi-Anger series expansion to approximate ideal directivity patterns and employs genetic algorithm to optimize array geometry and element directivity simultaneously with beamforming filters.

Result: The optimized array achieves lower approximation error than conventional linear superarrays across target frequency band and steering range, with more stable and improved directivity factor and white noise gain.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of array geometry, element directivity, and beamforming filters significantly improves linear superarray performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Linear superarrays (LSAs) have been proposed to address the limited steering
capability of conventional linear differential microphone arrays (LDMAs) by
integrating omnidirectional and directional microphones, enabling more flexible
beamformer designs. However, existing approaches remain limited because array
geometry and element directivity, both critical to beamforming performance, are
not jointly optimized. This paper presents a generalized LSA optimization
framework that simultaneously optimizes array geometry, element directivity,
and the beamforming filter to minimize the approximation error between the
designed beampattern and an ideal directivity pattern (IDP) over the full
frequency band and all steering directions within the region of interest. The
beamformer is derived by approximating the IDP using a Jacobi-Anger series
expansion, while the array geometry and element directivity are optimized via a
genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed optimized array
achieves lower approximation error than conventional LSAs across the target
frequency band and steering range. Additionally, its directivity factor and
white noise gain demonstrate more stable and improved performance across
frequencies and steering angles.

*Dian Chen,Yunkai Chen,Tong Lin,Sijie Chen,Xiaolin Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GeoPep is a novel framework for protein-peptide binding site prediction that uses transfer learning from ESM3 protein foundation model and integrates structural information to overcome data limitations and peptide flexibility challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods struggle with protein-peptide interactions due to peptide conformational flexibility and limited structural data availability, making direct training of structure-aware models difficult.

Method: Fine-tunes ESM3's pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding, integrates with parameter-efficient neural network architecture, and uses distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information.

Result: GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding patterns.

Conclusion: The transfer learning approach successfully addresses data limitations in protein-peptide interactions and enables accurate binding site prediction despite peptide flexibility challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have
achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However,
extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due
to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited
availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware
models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework
for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3,
a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich
pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited
availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further
integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of
learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained
using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to
enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding
site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding
patterns.

*Hao Jiang,Xiaojun Yuan,Yinuo Huang,Qinghua Guo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Blind-MIMOSC is a pilot-free MIMO semantic communication framework using DJSCC transmitter and diffusion-based blind receiver for joint channel estimation and source recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for pilots in MIMO systems and enable joint channel estimation and source recovery without complicated full-network retraining when channel conditions or datasets change.

Method: Combines DJSCC transmitter that compresses source data using structural characteristics with parallel variational diffusion (PVD) receiver that uses pre-trained score networks for channel and source priors, operating plug-and-play during inference.

Result: Achieves superior channel and source recovery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches with drastically reduced channel bandwidth ratio.

Conclusion: Presents the first fully pilot-free solution for joint channel estimation and source recovery in block-fading MIMO systems, enabling efficient adaptation to changing conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
semantic communication (SC) framework named Blind-MIMOSC that consists of a
deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) transmitter and a diffusion-based
blind receiver. The DJSCC transmitter aims to compress and map the source data
into the transmitted signal by exploiting the structural characteristics of the
source data, while the diffusion-based blind receiver employs a parallel
variational diffusion (PVD) model to simultaneously recover the channel and the
source data from the received signal without using any pilots. The PVD model
leverages two pre-trained score networks to characterize the prior information
of the channel and the source data, operating in a plug-and-play manner during
inference. This design allows only the affected network to be retrained when
channel conditions or source datasets change, avoiding the complicated
full-network retraining required by end-to-end methods. This work presents the
first fully pilot-free solution for joint channel estimation and source
recovery in block-fading MIMO systems. Extensive experiments show that
Blind-MIMOSC with PVD achieves superior channel and source recovery accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with drastically reduced channel
bandwidth ratio.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a distributed and scalable precoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO using multi-agent DRL with limited information exchange to mitigate interference while achieving high throughput with lower signaling overhead than centralized schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precoding schemes for cell-free massive MIMO are either fully centralized (not scalable) or fully distributed (high interference). Need for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that support different use cases.

Method: Multi-timescale framework combining multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with expert insights from iterative algorithm to determine precoding matrices efficiently. Uses limited information exchange among precoding agents.

Result: Achieves higher aggregate throughput than distributed RZF and WMMSE algorithms. Similar performance to centralized RZF but with lower signaling overhead. Validated through simulations with varying numbers of O-RUs, users, and transmit antennas.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed precoding framework effectively balances performance and scalability, making it suitable for next-generation wireless systems requiring decentralized, high-capacity networks.

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology
for next-generation wireless systems. The integration of cell-free massive MIMO
within the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture addresses the growing
need for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that can support
different use cases. Precoding is a crucial step in the operation of cell-free
massive MIMO, where O-RUs steer their beams towards the intended users while
mitigating interference to other users. Current precoding schemes for cell-free
massive MIMO are either fully centralized or fully distributed. Centralized
schemes are not scalable, whereas distributed schemes may lead to a high
inter-O-RU interference. In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable
precoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO that uses limited information
exchange among precoding agents to mitigate interference. We formulate an
optimization problem for precoding that maximizes the aggregate throughput
while guaranteeing the minimum data rate requirements of users. The formulated
problem is nonconvex. We propose a multi-timescale framework that combines
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with expert insights from an
iterative algorithm to determine the precoding matrices efficiently. We conduct
simulations and compare the proposed framework with the centralized precoding
and distributed precoding methods for different numbers of O-RUs, users, and
transmit antennas. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a
higher aggregate throughput than the distributed regularized zero-forcing
(D-RZF) scheme and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm.
When compared with the centralized regularized zero-forcing (C-RZF) scheme, the
proposed framework achieves similar aggregate throughput performance but with a
lower signaling overhead.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: First field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at Owens Valley Radio Observatory showing how radio telescopes can detect and identify interfering transmitters using embedded watermarks, enabling cooperative spectrum sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting radio astronomy from increasing wireless interference near protected bands, as existing coordination frameworks cannot rapidly identify or suppress specific interfering transmitters, especially at low SNR levels.

Method: A narrow-band secondary transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark into its signal, while the wide-band radio telescope passively extracts the watermark from spectrogram data to detect interference and identify the device.

Result: Interference can be reliably detected and the interfering device uniquely identified even at low SNR where conventional demodulation is infeasible.

Conclusion: Pseudonymetry enables passive scientific receivers to participate in lightweight feedback loops to trigger shutdown of harmful transmissions, serving as a complementary enforcement tool for protecting radio astronomy environments.

Abstract: Protecting radio astronomy observatories from unintended interference is
critical as wireless transmissions increases near protected bands. While
database-driven coordination frameworks and radio quiet zones exist, they
cannot rapidly identify or suppress specific interfering transmitters,
especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. This paper presents the
first over-the-air field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory (OVRO), illustrating cooperative spectrum sharing between
heterogeneous wireless systems. In our experiment, a narrow-band secondary
transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark into its signal, while the wide-band
radio telescope passively extracts the watermark from spectrogram data. Results
show that interference can be reliably detected and the interfering device
uniquely identified even at low SNR where conventional demodulation is
infeasible. These findings validate that passive scientific receivers can
participate in a lightweight feedback loop to trigger shutdown of harmful
transmissions, demonstrating the potential of Pseudonymetry as a complementary
enforcement tool for protecting radio astronomy environments.

Motivation: To enable practical high-dynamic-range multiband acquisition in scenarios previously limited by dynamic range constraints and excessive oversampling requirements.

Method: Low-complexity, single-channel acquisition setup within the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) that uses modulo-folded, pointwise samples for signal reconstruction.

Result: Achieved up to 13x dynamic range improvement in hardware experiments with up to 6 spectral bands, while also tightening the previous sampling theorem for bandpass signals.

Conclusion: The approach enables sub-Nyquist sampling under the USF paradigm, overcoming previous limitations in dynamic range and oversampling for multiband signal acquisition.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing multiband signals
from modulo-folded, pointwise samples within the Unlimited Sensing Framework

Motivation: Current OFDM waveforms suffer serious performance degradation in high-mobility scenarios due to severe Doppler spreads, creating need for Doppler-resilient solutions for next-generation ISAC applications.

Method: Proposes affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform using flexible chirp signals as subcarriers, leveraging FMCW-like characteristics for adaptive ISAC.

Result: AFDM-ISAC demonstrates great potential for high-mobility scenarios, with performance analyzed through diversity order, ambiguity function, and Cramer-Rao Bound metrics.

Conclusion: AFDM-ISAC represents an emerging field with opportunities for new sensing algorithms and applications in next-generation wireless networks operating in high-mobility environments.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of
next-generation wireless networks, enabling a wide range of emerging
applications such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), which operate in high-mobility scenarios. Notably, the wireless
channels within these applications typically exhibit severe delay and Doppler
spreads. The latter causes serious communication performance degradation in the
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform that is widely
adopted in current wireless networks. To address this challenge, the recently
proposed Doppler-resilient affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)
waveform, which uses flexible chirp signals as subcarriers, shows great
potential for achieving adaptive ISAC in high-mobility scenarios. This article
provides a comprehensive overview of AFDM-ISAC. We begin by presenting the
fundamentals of AFDM-ISAC, highlighting its inherent frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW)-like characteristics. Then, we explore its ISAC
performance limits by analyzing its diversity order, ambiguity function (AF),
and Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB). Finally, we present several effective sensing
algorithms and opportunities for AFDM-ISAC, with the aim of sparking new ideas
in this emerging field.

TL;DR: A hybrid indoor asset tracking system combining visible light communication and backscatter communication for energy-neutral IoT devices, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy without power-hungry components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide sustainable IoT location services using ubiquitous lighting infrastructure while avoiding power-hungry, complex, and expensive conventional visible light positioning receivers.

Method: Designs energy-neutral backscatter devices that harvest LED light energy and reflect ambient RF signals. Uses multi-cell VLC with frequency division multiplexing and a particle filter algorithm fusing proximity reports and backscatter signal strength.

Result: Achieves positioning errors of 0.318m at 50th percentile and 0.634m at 90th percentile, demonstrating robust performance across multiple indoor trajectories.

Conclusion: The solution enables scalable, cost-effective, and energy-neutral indoor tracking for pervasive IoT applications by eliminating complex photodetectors and active RF components.

Abstract: In next-generation wireless systems, providing location-based mobile
computing services for energy-neutral devices has become a crucial objective
for the provision of sustainable Internet of Things (IoT). Visible light
positioning (VLP) has gained great research attention as a complementary method
to radio frequency (RF) solutions since it can leverage ubiquitous lighting
infrastructure. However, conventional VLP receivers often rely on
photodetectors or cameras that are power-hungry, complex, and expensive. To
address this challenge, we propose a hybrid indoor asset tracking system that
integrates visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC)
within a simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT)
framework. We design a low-complexity and energy-neutral IoT node, namely
backscatter device (BD) which harvests energy from light-emitting diode (LED)
access points, and then modulates and reflects ambient RF carriers to indicate
its location within particular VLC cells. We present a multi-cell VLC
deployment with frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method that mitigates
interference among LED access points by assigning them distinct frequency pairs
based on a four-color map scheduling principle. We develop a lightweight
particle filter (PF) tracking algorithm at an edge RF reader, where the fusion
of proximity reports and the received backscatter signal strength are employed
to track the BD. Experimental results show that this approach achieves the
positioning error of 0.318 m at 50th percentile and 0.634 m at 90th percentile,
while avoiding the use of complex photodetectors and active RF synthesizing
components at the energy-neutral IoT node. By demonstrating robust performance
in multiple indoor trajectories, the proposed solution enables scalable,
cost-effective, and energy-neutral indoor tracking for pervasive and
edge-assisted IoT applications.

TL;DR: Proposes using stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) in full-duplex systems to reduce self-interference through wave-domain signal processing, controlled by an end-to-end learning approach that treats the metasurface as hidden layers in an electromagnetic neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To further suppress inherent self-interference in co-frequency co-time full-duplex (CCFD) systems and enhance signal processing capabilities in the wave domain.

Method: Integrates SIM into RF front-end and uses end-to-end learning-based signal processing that abstracts the real metasurface as hidden layers of a network, creating an electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to control the communication system.

Result: Simulation results show significantly reduced bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional CCFD systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of SIM's wave-domain processing capability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential applications of EMNN and SIM-assisted E2E CCFD systems in next-generation transceiver design.

Abstract: To further suppress the inherent self-interference (SI) in co-frequency and
co-time full-duplex (CCFD) systems, we propose integrating a stacked
intelligent metasurface (SIM) into the RF front-end to enhance signal
processing in the wave domain. Furthermore, an end-to-end (E2E) learning-based
signal processing method is adopted to control the metasurface. Specifically,
the real metasurface is abstracted as hidden layers of a network, thereby
constructing an electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to enable driving control
of the real communication system. Traditional communication tasks, such as
channel coding, modulation, precoding, combining, demodulation, and channel
decoding, are synchronously carried out during the electromagnetic (EM) forward
propagation through the metasurface. Simulation results show that, benefiting
from the additional wave-domain processing capability of the SIM, the
SIM-assisted CCFD system achieves significantly reduced bit error rate (BER)
compared with conventional CCFD systems. Our study fully demonstrates the
potential applications of EMNN and SIM-assisted E2E CCFD systems in
next-generation transceiver design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites move rapidly and are visible for short periods, requiring efficient beam tracking. Hybrid analog-digital architectures in ground stations need methods to handle beam steering and localization challenges.

Method: Uses variational message passing to jointly estimate satellite localization and beam tracking. Models the satellite orbit as circular and derives angles from orbit parameters.

Result: Simulations show the method is resilient to missed detections, enables reliable tracking near the horizon, and resolves ambiguities in hybrid architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses LEO satellite tracking challenges with hybrid transceivers, providing robust performance in difficult scenarios.

Abstract: Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems that use
millimeter-wave frequencies rely on large antenna arrays with hybrid
analog-digital architectures for rapid beam steering. LEO satellites are only
visible from the ground for short periods of times (a few tens of minutes) due
to their high orbital speeds. This paper presents a variational message passing
algorithm for joint localization and beam tracking of a LEO satellite from a
ground station equipped with a hybrid transceiver architecture. The algorithm
relies on estimating the parameters of the orbit, which is modelled as
circular. Angles are then obtained from the orbit in a straightforward manner.
Simulation results show that the proposed method is highly resilient to missed
detections, enables reliable satellite tracking even near the horizon, and
effectively alleviates the ambiguities inherent in hybrid architectures.

*Sagar Dutta,Banani Basu,Fazal Ahmed Talukdar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper investigates using creeping wave propagation around the human thigh to monitor leg movements for activity classification, achieving best results with SVM and DWT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for monitoring leg movements using on-body antenna propagation characteristics for activity classification applications.

Method: Used two flexible PET antennas on the thigh to measure transmission coefficient variations during six leg activities. Applied DWT for feature extraction and tested multiple classifiers including SVM, decision trees, naive Bayes, KNN, DTW, and DCNN.

Result: SVM with DWT achieved the best classification performance. SAR simulation showed compliance with FCC safety standards when antennas are placed directly on the thigh.

Conclusion: Creeping wave propagation around the thigh provides effective signatures for leg movement classification, with SVM+DWT being the optimal approach, and the system meets safety requirements.

Abstract: This article investigates how the creeping wave propagation around the human
thigh could be used to monitor the leg movements. The propagation path around
the human thigh gives information regarding leg motions that can be used for
the classification of activities. The variation of the transmission coefficient
is measured between two on-body polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible
antennas for six different leg-based activities that exhibit unique
time-varying signatures. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) along with
different classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), decision trees,
naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), is applied for feature extraction
and classification to evaluate the efficiency for classifying different
activity signals. Additional algorithms, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), have also been implemented, and in
each case, SVM with DWT outperforms the others. Simulation to evaluate a
specific absorption rate (SAR) is carried out as the antenna is positioned on
the human thigh leaving no gap. The results show that the SAR is within the
threshold as per the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standard.

*Sagar Dutta,Banani Basu,Fazal Ahmed Talukdar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a novel non-invasive fault detection method for induction motors using an antenna sensor to measure S11 reflection coefficient, achieving 98.2% classification accuracy with deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault analysis methods are expensive or require expertise for sensor installation, while early fault diagnosis can reduce economic losses from unexpected machine failures.

Method: Uses an omnidirectional antenna to measure time-varying S11 reflection coefficient, analyzes spectrograms for fault characteristics, validates with FFT analysis, and employs deep learning for fault classification using S11 magnitude and phase data.

Result: Achieved 98.2% classification accuracy using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% with magnitude only, and 92.1% with phase only. Also evaluated performance across different operating frequencies, antenna locations, and time windows.

Conclusion: The antenna-based sensor method provides a cost-efficient, non-invasive solution for bearing fault and imbalance detection in induction motors with high classification accuracy using deep learning models.

Abstract: Early fault diagnosis is imperative for the proper functioning of rotating
machines. It can reduce economic losses in the industry due to unexpected
failures. Existing fault analysis methods are either expensive or demand
expertise for the installation of the sensors. This article proposes a novel
method for the detection of bearing faults and imbalance in induction motors
using an antenna as the sensor, which is noninvasive and cost-efficient.
Time-varying S11 is measured using an omnidirectional antenna, and it is seen
that the spectrogram of S11 shows unique characteristics for different fault
conditions. The experimental setup has analytically evaluated the vibration
frequencies due to fault and validated the characteristic fault frequency by
applying FFT analysis on the captured S11 data. This article has evaluated the
average power content of the detected signals at normal and different fault
conditions. A deep learning model is used to classify the faults based on the
reflection coefficient ( S11). It is found that classification accuracy of
98.2% is achieved using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% using the
magnitude of S11 and 92.1% using the phase of S11. The classification accuracy
for different operating frequencies, antenna location, and time windows are
also investigated.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: UNILocPro is a unified localization framework that combines model-based methods and channel charting for mixed LoS/NLoS scenarios, using adaptive activation and unsupervised learning with multiple loss functions to preserve global geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address localization challenges in mixed line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight scenarios by integrating model-based and channel charting approaches for improved accuracy without requiring labeled training data.

Method: Uses LoS/NLoS identification for adaptive activation between model-based and CC methods. Employs unsupervised learning with multiple loss functions: pairwise distance loss, triplet loss (with timestamps), LoS-based loss, and optimal transport-based loss. Also proposes UNILoc as a low-complexity variant using pre-training OT transformation.

Result: Significantly improved positioning accuracy compared to both model-based and CC-based methods. UNILocPro with timestamps achieves performance comparable to fully-supervised fingerprinting without labeled data. UNILoc reduces training complexity with only marginal performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed unified frameworks effectively combine model-based and channel charting approaches for accurate localization in mixed LoS/NLoS scenarios, achieving supervised-level performance through unsupervised learning while offering complexity-reduced alternatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified localization framework (called UNILocPro)
that integrates model-based localization and channel charting (CC) for mixed
line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Specifically, based on
LoS/NLoS identification, an adaptive activation between the model-based and
CC-based methods is conducted. Aiming for unsupervised learning, information
obtained from the model-based method is utilized to train the CC model, where a
pairwise distance loss (involving a new dissimilarity metric design), a triplet
loss (if timestamps are available), a LoS-based loss, and an optimal transport
(OT)-based loss are jointly employed such that the global geometry can be well
preserved. To reduce the training complexity of UNILocPro, we propose a
low-complexity implementation (called UNILoc), where the CC model is trained
with self-generated labels produced by a single pre-training OT transformation,
which avoids iterative Sinkhorn updates involved in the OT-based loss
computation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
unified frameworks achieve significantly improved positioning accuracy compared
to both model-based and CC-based methods. Notably, UNILocPro with timestamps
attains performance on par with fully-supervised fingerprinting despite
operating without labelled training data. It is also shown that the
low-complexity UNILoc can substantially reduce training complexity with only
marginal performance degradation.

### [211] [Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27408)
*Nelson Mattié,Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa,Pablo Crespo-Peremarch,Juan-Ygnacio López-Hernández*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study develops improved methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests using various laser scanning technologies combined with machine learning approaches to support carbon emission reporting under the Paris Agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical dry forests are poorly understood but crucial for carbon sequestration under the Paris Climate Agreement, which requires accurate forest data for emission reporting. There's a need for precise methods to estimate carbon pools in these ecosystems.

Method: Used comparative analysis of AGB estimates with discrete and full-waveform laser scanning data (Airborne, Unmanned, and Space Laser Scanning) combined with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian SVM approaches. Applied machine learning techniques including variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation.

Result: Identified six key height-related variables as important for AGB estimation. AGB values ranged from 26.02 to 175.43 Mg/ha in Costa Rican plots. SVM regressions achieved 17.89% error across all systems, with Space Laser Scanning showing the lowest error (17.07%) for biomass estimation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that laser scanning technologies combined with machine learning approaches can effectively estimate aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests, supporting accurate carbon accounting required by international climate agreements.

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to
submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years
by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon
emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the
significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate
change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality
forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground
biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the
least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for
accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis
of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning
datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches
SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning
were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable
selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning
approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results
indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,
Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are
important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,
canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy
emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent
tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02
Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across
all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in
estimating total biomass per plot.

### [212] [pDANSE: Particle-based Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation from Nonlinear Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27503)
*Anubhab Ghosh,Yonina C. Eldar,Saikat Chatterjee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes pDANSE, a particle-based data-driven nonlinear state estimation method that handles model-free processes with nonlinear measurements using RNN-based Gaussian priors and reparameterization trick-based particle sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DANSE methods assume linear measurement systems for closed-form solutions, but real-world applications often involve nonlinear measurements where closed-form solutions are infeasible. There's a need for efficient state estimation for model-free processes with nonlinear measurements.

Method: Uses RNN to generate Gaussian prior parameters from previous measurements, then employs reparameterization trick-based particle sampling to estimate second-order statistics of state posterior for nonlinear measurements. Avoids computationally intensive SMC/ancestral sampling.

Result: Experimental evaluation on stochastic Lorenz-63 system shows competitive state estimation performance for four nonlinear measurement systems (cubic, camera-model, half-wave rectification, Cartesian-to-spherical) compared to particle filters with full STM knowledge.

Conclusion: pDANSE provides an efficient data-driven approach for nonlinear state estimation in model-free processes, achieving competitive performance without requiring knowledge of the underlying state transition model.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation
(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose
underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred
to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides
parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free
process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of
DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for
the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system
renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics
of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed
at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a
reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the
second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred
to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential
measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the
semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised
learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system
as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation
performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic
nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is
used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and
Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The
performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle
filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.

Conclusion: AI has significant potential to enhance GNSS security and robustness for positioning applications by addressing limitations of traditional interference management approaches.

Abstract: The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) continues to evolve in order to
meet the demands of emerging applications such as autonomous driving and smart
