### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene is an online feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from two consecutive surround-view images using a lightweight residual flow network and coarse-to-fine training, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenging due to complex dynamics and sparse views, with existing methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency.

Method: Uses a lightweight residual flow network that predicts non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. Employs a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to avoid instabilities in end-to-end approaches.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DrivingScene framework effectively reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from sparse views, achieving superior performance in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis while maintaining online operation.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM is a motion-augmented caption model that improves video captioning by incorporating motion-aware decoding using human mesh recovery to capture fine-grained human body dynamics, reducing hallucinations and enhancing semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or semantically inconsistent captions that fail to accurately describe human actions.

Method: M-ACM leverages motion representations from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics, using motion-aware decoding to enhance caption generation. The approach is supported by the HMI Dataset with 115K video-description pairs and HMI-Bench benchmark.

Result: M-ACM significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-augmented approach effectively addresses limitations in existing video captioning by incorporating explicit motion representations, leading to more accurate and semantically faithful descriptions of human actions.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition on SAR images using synthetic data from two complementary simulators (MOCEM and Salsa) to overcome the simulation-to-reality gap, achieving 88% accuracy on real MSTAR measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real labeled SAR measurements are scarce, so synthetic data from simulators is used, but simulations have simplifying assumptions that limit generalization to real data.

Method: Combine two SAR simulators with different paradigms (MOCEM using scattering centers model and Salsa using ray tracing) to generate synthetic datasets, then train ATR models using the ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: Achieved almost 88% accuracy on real MSTAR measurements, demonstrating improved generalization from synthetic to real data.

Conclusion: Using complementary simulation paradigms can effectively bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in SAR ATR, enabling successful Deep Learning model training on synthetic data that generalizes well to real measurements.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a machine learning framework using Random Forest and XGBoost to predict point-level uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds based on local geometric features, achieving ROC-AUC >0.87 without requiring reference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling for MLS point clouds requires costly high-precision reference data, which is impractical for large-scale applications. There's a need for scalable uncertainty evaluation methods.

Method: Uses ensemble learning models (RF and XGBoost) trained on spatially partitioned real-world data to learn relationships between local geometric features and point-level errors, avoiding data leakage.

Result: Both models effectively capture nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. Key predictive features include elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale point clouds, offering foundation for future quality control and error analysis without requiring reference data.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining eye-tracking and facial features for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis achieves 95.11% accuracy using cross-attention fusion and directional-aware convolution modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention, and multimodal approaches integrating complementary behavioral and perceptual information show promise, but few studies have explored joint eye-tracking and facial feature integration.

Method: Proposed a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework with two key modules: Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions via cross-attention, and Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for capturing directional facial features using horizontal-vertical receptive fields.

Result: Achieved 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from healthy controls, outperforming traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, demonstrating superior robustness and diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions, providing an adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning approach for enhanced AD diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent vehicles require reliable lane detection for automation applications in both urban roads and robot tracks, prioritizing accurate and fast lane path detection.

Method: Proposes an FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle architecture using Sobel algorithm for edge detection, operating on 416x416 images at 150MHz frequency.

Result: System achieves 1.17ms processing time per image, outputs lane count, current lane index, and lane boundaries, with automated light and temperature control for environmental adaptability.

Conclusion: The FPGA-based LDV architecture provides fast and reliable lane detection suitable for intelligent vehicle applications, with environmental adaptability features enhancing system robustness.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA is a full-stack optimization framework that enables real-time photorealistic codec avatar inference on resource-constrained VR devices through efficient quantization and custom hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic Codec Avatars enable immersive VR communication but face computational challenges for real-time inference on resource-constrained VR devices where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposed an efficient post-training quantization method for Codec Avatar models and designed a custom hardware accelerator for VR SoC integration, combined into the ESCA full-stack optimization framework.

Result: ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39 over 4-bit baselines, achieves 3.36× latency reduction, and sustains 100 FPS rendering rate, meeting real-time VR requirements.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, enabling more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models outperform GNNs on holistic graph understanding tasks, showing better global pattern recognition and scale-invariant reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human visual perception captures global structures first, while GNNs use bottom-up message-passing. Existing benchmarks conflate domain features with topological understanding.

Method: Introduced GraphAbstract benchmark to evaluate models' ability to perceive global graph properties like organizational archetypes, symmetry detection, connectivity strength, and critical element identification.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales. GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size.

Conclusion: Vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning, opening new avenues for graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data that combines graph fusion, pseudo-labeling, and topological corrections to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with multi-view data due to lack of clear graph structures and complex data relationships. Existing techniques have limitations in integrating graph structures effectively in multi-view contexts.

Method: Combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in GCN framework, dynamically incorporates pseudo-labels into loss function, corrects topological imbalances by adjusting weights near class boundaries, and adds unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Experimental results show RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning approaches on multi-view benchmark image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses multi-view learning challenges through integrated graph-based techniques and maintains computational efficiency while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench is a new multilingual benchmark for vision-language models, created from expert-designed PISA tests and translated into 6 languages, revealing performance gaps in small models and non-English reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing multimodal benchmarks that lack high-quality human-verified examples and are predominantly English-only, while synthetic LLM-generated datasets have quality concerns.

Method: Derived examples from expert-created PISA tests, including human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images. Translated English content into 5 additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian) to create a fully parallel corpus across 6 languages.

Result: Small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores, substantial performance degradation on non-English splits, and high error rates on spatial and geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, highlighting current model limitations in cross-lingual performance and complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs), addressing computational and data efficiency challenges through a unified taxonomy across model design, training, and data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face deployment challenges due to substantial computational and data requirements from their large-scale foundation models, creating an urgent need for efficiency solutions.

Method: Introduces a unified taxonomy categorizing techniques into three pillars: Efficient Model Design (architectures and compression), Efficient Training (reducing computational burdens), and Efficient Data Collection (addressing robotic data bottlenecks).

Result: The survey establishes a foundational reference framework, summarizes state-of-the-art methods, reviews representative applications, and identifies key challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive roadmap for future research in Efficient VLAs and maintains an updated project page for ongoing developments in this emerging field.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models exhibit human-like conflict adaptation behavior in Stroop tasks, with neural analysis revealing specialized supernodes that handle cognitive conflict similarly to human brain mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models demonstrate human-like cognitive control mechanisms, specifically conflict adaptation, and understand the neural representations underlying this behavior.

Method: Used sequential Stroop task with 13 VLMs, analyzed neural representations using sparse autoencoders on InternVL 3.5 4B to identify task-relevant supernodes, and performed ablation studies.

Result: 12 of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior; identified overlapping text/color supernodes in early/late layers reflecting human automaticity asymmetry; isolated conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increased Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs can exhibit human-like cognitive control mechanisms, with specialized neural representations that parallel human cognitive architecture for conflict processing.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap is a lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption model that uses dual retrieval (image-to-text and image-to-image) to generate both text and visual prompts, enhancing visual representation for better object details and complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight retrieval-augmented caption models use retrieved data only as text prompts, creating a semantic gap by leaving original visual features unenhanced, especially for object details and complex scenes.

Method: Proposes DualCap with dual retrieval mechanism: standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and novel image-to-image retrieval for visually similar scenes. Extracts salient keywords/phrases from similar scenes' captions, encodes them, and integrates with original image features through lightweight trainable feature fusion network.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: DualCap effectively addresses the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented captioning by enriching visual representation through dual retrieval and feature fusion, achieving strong performance with reduced parameters.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI), a co-designed framework using bio-inspired spherical optics and deep learning to achieve high-fidelity RGBD imaging from single coded captures, outperforming existing methods in both depth estimation and image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of conventional compact optics struggling with RGB sharpness across depth-of-field and software-only Monocular Depth Estimation being ill-posed with unreliable semantic priors, while avoiding the fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations of deep optics with DOEs.

Method: Developed a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens that naturally encodes depth into depth-varying PSFs, established a physically-based forward model for synthetic data generation, and co-designed with a dual-head multi-scale reconstruction network using shared encoder to jointly recover All-in-Focus images and depth maps.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: depth estimation with Abs Rel of 0.026 and RMSE of 0.130, significantly outperforming software-only approaches and other deep optics systems; image restoration with SSIM of 0.960 and LPIPS of 0.082, confirming superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of bio-inspired fully spherical optics with joint reconstruction algorithm effectively addresses intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging, demonstrating a successful co-design approach.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage deep learning framework combining vision backbones, ML classifiers, and feature selection achieves 85.99% accuracy for fish freshness assessment, outperforming previous methods by 8.69-22.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness is subjective and inconsistent, while existing deep learning methods lack accuracy and feature transparency.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune 5 vision architectures, 2) Extract multi-level features to train 7 ML classifiers, 3) Apply feature selection methods (LGBM, Random Forest, Lasso) to identify compact feature subsets.

Result: Best configuration (Swin-Tiny features + Extra Trees classifier + LGBM feature selection) achieved 85.99% accuracy on FFE dataset, outperforming recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks, providing reliable fish freshness assessment.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video fake news detection benchmarks focus only on final accuracy without providing fine-grained assessment of the detection process, making it a black box that lacks transparency and detailed evaluation.

Method: Created MVFNDB benchmark with 10 tasks and 9730 human-annotated video questions based on a taxonomy of VFND abilities. Designed MVFND-CoT framework that incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning to validate multi-feature combination impact.

Result: The benchmark enables in-depth analysis of factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and alignment between video features and model capabilities.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in video fake news detection by enabling comprehensive assessment of detection processes beyond just final accuracy.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models that reduces over-refusal and improves safety-utility balance through post-hoc editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time safety methods for text-to-image models suffer from over-refusal and poor balance between safety and utility, requiring a more effective solution.

Method: Proposed MR-SafeEdit framework with a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset and SafeEditor MLLM that performs post-hoc safety editing through iterative refinement.

Result: SafeEditor outperforms prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving better safety-utility balance in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The multi-round safety editing framework provides an effective model-agnostic solution for safety alignment in text-to-image models, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

TL;DR: MCIHN is a hybrid network model using adversarial autoencoders and cross-modal interaction for multimodal emotion recognition, achieving superior performance on SIMS and MOSI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate multimodal emotion recognition faces challenges due to modality differences and difficulty in characterizing unimodal emotional information.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative features, then applies Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality discrepancies and generate interaction features, followed by Feature Fusion module (FFM) for multimodal fusion.

Result: MCIHN achieves superior performance on publicly available SIMS and MOSI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIHN model effectively addresses modality differences and improves emotion recognition through cross-modal interaction and feature fusion.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success but the factors influencing its generation quality remain poorly understood. The authors want to empirically probe the generation process from a denoising perspective.

Method: The authors design a framework that lays down formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers, providing a common ground to compare their performances on generation and denoising. They introduce principled perturbations (noise and drift) to influence sample generation.

Conclusion: Understanding the distinct phases of the generative process and when denoisers succeed or fail provides crucial insights into why generation quality matters in flow matching models.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled

This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

TL;DR: The paper reframes fruit maturity estimation from discrete classification to continuous probabilistic learning, proposing a probabilistic head for RT-DETRv2 that predicts continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat maturity as discrete classification, which conflicts with the continuous nature of biological ripening, causing information loss and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Proposes architectural modification to RT-DETRv2 by adding a dedicated probabilistic head that predicts continuous distribution over maturity spectrum, learning mean maturity state and associated uncertainty simultaneously.

Result: Achieves 85.6% mAP on challenging fruit dataset while providing richer biological representation and granular maturity assessments compared to classification-based methods.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach enables more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems for agriculture, offering crucial confidence scores for robotic decision-making like selective harvesting.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the time performance limitations of OpenPose-based sign language recognition while maintaining accuracy, as simply replacing OpenPose with lightweight MediaPipe reduced accuracy significantly.

Method: Used landmark subset selection strategies to optimize recognition performance and implemented spline-based imputation to handle missing landmarks effectively.

Result: Proper landmark subset achieved comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to previous approaches. Spline-based imputation also provided substantial accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection combined with simple imputation techniques enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Method: Analyze sequential camera frames to compute background by averaging pixel values, then extract foreground and apply DBSCAN algorithm for vehicle detection.

Result: Computationally efficient method with minimal infrastructure modification requirements.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment in traffic optimization systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban

designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic

component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to

TL;DR: VividCam enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos instead of real videos, using disentanglement strategies to isolate motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to insufficient training data with such motions, limiting creative and artistic video generation.

Method: Proposes a training paradigm using synthetic videos from engines like Unity, with multiple disentanglement strategies to separate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts.

Result: The method synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled complex camera motions using simple synthetic data (basic geometries in low-poly 3D scenes).

Conclusion: VividCam successfully enables robust camera motion learning from synthetic data, overcoming the challenge of collecting realistic training videos with uncommon camera motions.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into multi-view transformers' inner workings, showing they differ from methods with explicit pose inductive biases and enabling better understanding for future improvements.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization and overall performance.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Identify dominant modality using Shapley values based on accuracy contributions, 2) Decompose loss landscape by modulating loss to prioritize robustness for dominant modality, 3) Update weights via backpropagation of modulated gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, significantly balancing and improving multimodal learning.

Conclusion: M-SAM ensures robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, allowing models to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Method: Developed IBIS - a hybrid architecture integrating Inception-BiLSTM with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to improve generalization and create robust classification boundaries.

Result: Achieved nearly 99% movement recognition accuracy using Doppler-derived data, with comprehensive metrics and confusion matrices confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The IBIS architecture successfully addresses overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing and demonstrates high accuracy for movement recognition applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy

interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based ALPR system using YOLOv8 with semi-supervised learning, achieving high recall rates of 94% and 91% on benchmark datasets while reducing manual labeling requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR systems face challenges from environmental factors, vehicle speeds, camera angles, and image quality. ALPR is crucial for traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition with semi-supervised learning framework. Combines manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to automatically annotate images, reducing manual labeling effort.

Result: Achieved 94% recall on CENPARMI dataset and 91% recall on UFPR-ALPR dataset. Also reports character error rates for comprehensive performance evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses ALPR challenges through deep learning and semi-supervised approach, achieving high performance while reducing manual annotation requirements through automated pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage both imaging data and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models require expensive large-scale pretraining, creating efficiency concerns that discourage researchers from training models from scratch.

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) adapts to input images and dynamically merges tokens in deeper layers of visual encoders.

Result: Significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance on ImageNet training and CLIP pretraining; validated through continual pretraining on biology datasets.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an effective approach to reduce computational costs in vision-language model training without sacrificing performance, extending applicability to scientific domains.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Conclusion: Cross-modal alignment and language grounding effectively enhance generalization for real-world scene understanding through vision-language integration.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to

### [35] [PSTF-AttControl: Per-Subject-Tuning-Free Personalized Image Generation with Controllable Face Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25084)
*Xiang liu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Huan Hu,Zipeng Wang,Ping Chen,Zezhou Chen,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) method for personalized image generation that enables precise facial attribute control while preserving facial identity, using face recognition features mapped to StyleGAN2's latent space with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise facial attribute control in PSTF settings - tuning-based methods require technical expertise and additional data, while PSTF approaches lack precise attribute control despite being user-friendly.

Method: Uses face recognition model to extract identity features, maps them to StyleGAN2's W+ latent space via e4e encoder, and employs Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to integrate identity, attribute features, and text embeddings in UNet architecture for clean separation.

Result: Successfully generates personalized images with fine-grained facial attribute control while preserving identity, without requiring additional fine-tuning or training data for individual identities.

Conclusion: The approach balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering an efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality facial image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

### [36] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP is a framework for zero-shot human-object interaction detection that addresses visual complexity through diversity-aware prompt learning and region-specific concept retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot HOI detection methods using CLIP fail to handle visual complexity - intra-class diversity (same verb in different poses/contexts) and inter-class entanglement (different verbs with similar visual patterns).

Method: Proposes VDRP with two key components: 1) Visual diversity-aware prompt learning using group-wise variance injection and Gaussian perturbation, 2) Region-aware prompts enhanced with concepts retrieved from human, object, and union regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: VDRP successfully handles visual complexity in zero-shot HOI detection through diversity-aware and region-aware prompt learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth indoor/urban scene reconstruction that preserves details and efficiency while handling low-texture regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric priors for indoor/urban scenes lack global consistency, and current methods (Gaussian Splatting, implicit SDF) suffer from discontinuities, computational inefficiency, and loss of detail.

Method: Combines Atlanta-world model with novel implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting representations, including semantic GS representation for semantic region probability prediction and structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves smooth reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency, effectively addressing low-texture region reconstruction with global consistency.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel activation method that improves on conventional CAM by generating more complete object coverage and better boundary alignment through semantic information maps and propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods only highlight the most discriminative regions, failing to cover entire objects and having poor boundary alignment, which limits performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Region-CAM extracts semantic information maps (SIMs) and performs semantic information propagation (SIP) using both gradients and features from all stages of the baseline classification model, rather than just network feature weighting.

Result: Significant improvements over original CAM: 60.12% mIoU on PASCAL VOC training (vs 46.51%), 58.43% on validation (vs 45.30%), 36.38% on MS COCO (vs 20.15%), and 51.7% Top-1 localization accuracy on ILSVRC2012, outperforming LayerCAM by 4.5%.

Conclusion: Region-CAM effectively addresses the limitations of conventional CAM methods by providing more complete object coverage and precise boundary alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for AI-generated image detection lack theoretical foundations, rely on empirical heuristics, and suffer from poor interpretability and reliability. They often fail when real images show lower reconstruction error than generated ones.

Method: Proposes ReGap method that computes dynamic reconstruction error using structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. Measures error changes before and after editing to enhance error separation between real and generated images.

Result: Experimental results show ReGap outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations, and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ReGap method provides a more reliable and theoretically grounded approach for AI-generated image detection by leveraging dynamic reconstruction error through controlled perturbations, overcoming limitations of static error-based methods.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified and efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding that enables broad downstream tasks.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of thin film interferometry is hindered by challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts.

Method: Vision transformer-based approach trained on hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, leveraging long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities.

Result: The network demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods.

Conclusion: The data-driven approach enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware, opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions like dry eye disease.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Result: Extensive comparisons show TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across single-condition and multi-condition tasks.

Conclusion: TGBFN successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal CAD generation and demonstrates superior performance in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

### [45] [$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)
*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D²GS is a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses multi-view depth predictions and diffusion priors to achieve geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based methods, while avoiding LiDAR's calibration and alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods rely on multimodal sensors (LiDAR + images), but acquiring accurate LiDAR data is challenging due to spatiotemporal calibration requirements and reprojection errors from spatial misalignment between sensors.

Method: 1) Initialize dense point cloud from multi-view metric depth predictions with Progressive Pruning for global consistency; 2) Jointly refine Gaussian geometry and depth via Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors; 3) Improve ground geometry by constraining Gaussian shape/normal attributes in road regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo dataset show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even compared to methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: D²GS demonstrates that LiDAR-free reconstruction can achieve superior geometry quality through effective use of depth prediction and diffusion priors, eliminating the practical challenges of LiDAR data acquisition.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts classifier using both global (dataset-level) and local (image-level) contextual information to address class imbalance and unique image characteristics in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional semantic segmentation classifiers use fixed parameters that cannot adapt to individual image characteristics or handle class imbalance, leading to biased results favoring majority classes.

Method: Uses memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information, incorporates image-specific contextual information, and employs teacher-student network paradigm where teacher dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground truth and transfers knowledge to student.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic classifier adjustment using both global and local contextual information effectively addresses class imbalance and improves semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

### [47] [Test-Time Adaptive Object Detection with Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25175)
*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates source data dependency and closed-set limitations, using multi-modal prompt tuning and instance dynamic memory for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods rely heavily on source data and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains, which limits real-world applicability.

Method: Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework with text and visual prompt tuning, Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and Instance Dynamic Memory module with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, adapting to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates source data dependency and overcomes closed-set limitations, providing a more practical solution for real-world test-time adaptive object detection.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%

and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

### [50] [U-CAN: Unsupervised Point Cloud Denoising with Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25210)
*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving comparable results to supervised methods without requiring clean-noisy pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scanning sensors often contain noise that negatively impacts downstream tasks. Previous supervised methods require extensive manual effort to collect noisy-clean pairs, motivating an unsupervised approach.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network to infer multi-step denoising paths with Noise2Noise matching, employing a novel loss for statistical reasoning on multiple noisy observations and a consistency constraint on denoised geometry.

Result: U-CAN shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and produces comparable results with supervised methods in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework with consistency-aware constraints effectively addresses point cloud denoising without requiring clean data, and the method generalizes beyond 3D to 2D image denoising.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net is a novel photometric stereo framework that extracts multi-stage features with selective update strategy and feature fusion to improve surface normal estimation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on DiLiGenT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods fail to accurately capture multi-stage features and lack adequate feature interaction, leading to redundant feature extraction especially in complex areas like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Proposed MSF-Net with multi-stage feature extraction, selective update strategy to extract high-quality features, and feature fusion module to improve interaction between different features for accurate normal construction.

Result: Experimental results on DiLiGenT benchmark show MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Net framework effectively addresses limitations in existing photometric stereo methods by enabling better multi-stage feature extraction and interaction, leading to improved normal estimation performance.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

TL;DR: A new SFDA framework using hard sample selection and denoised patch mixing for medical image segmentation that progressively aligns target distributions by starting with easy samples and gradually incorporating harder ones while suppressing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA approaches ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift, especially in medical image segmentation under privacy constraints.

Method: Partitions unlabeled images into reliable/unreliable subsets via entropy-similarity analysis, refines pseudo-labels using Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, and employs intra-/inter-domain patch mixing objectives to transfer reliable semantics while mitigating noise.

Result: Achieves consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods with more accurate boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust segmentation under domain shift in privacy-constrained medical imaging.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [53] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to improve rectified flow by incorporating real images into training, reducing reliance on large generated datasets and achieving better performance with fewer generative pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow faces challenges: 1) reflow requires many generative pairs (computationally expensive), 2) performance depends heavily on 1-rectified flow model, causing bias towards generated data.

Method: Incorporates real images into training process to preserve ODE paths for real images, enabling efficient reflow with smaller sets of generated and real images.

Result: Achieved significantly better FID scores on CIFAR-10 in both one-step generation and full-step simulations using only fraction of generative pairs compared to original method. Also induced straighter paths and avoided saturation on generated images.

Conclusion: The approach enables more robust ODE learning while preserving real image distribution, making rectified flow more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for generating emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem using speech and emotion blendshapes with sparsity constraints for disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to high capture costs, and existing methods focus mainly on lip-sync without addressing emotional expressivity in talking faces.

Method: Joint learning of speech and emotion blendshapes using VOCAset (neutral expressions) and Florence4D (3D expression sequences), with sparsity constraint loss for disentanglement. The blendshapes are mapped to FLAME model parameters for 3D Gaussian avatar animation.

Result: The method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies show superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: The proposed linear additive modeling approach with sparsity constraints successfully enables emotionally expressive 3D talking face generation using limited emotional 3D data, achieving both good emotional expressivity and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts, raising concerns about misuse for fraud and misinformation.

Method: Enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with Local Patch Guidance (spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision) and Global Forgery Diversification (domain feature augmentation with domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: DeepShield demonstrates that integrating novel local and global analysis approaches significantly improves deepfake detection robustness across diverse manipulation techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Motivation: Most studies treat TOF as a single class or use rigid rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and regional adaptability.

Method: Compared CNN, vision transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures to map four woody vegetation categories: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree.

Result: Models achieved good classification accuracy with FT-UNetFormer performing best (mean IoU 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84), showing good results for Forest and Linear classes but challenges with complex Patch and Tree structures.

Conclusion: Spatial context understanding is crucial for TOF mapping, and regionally diverse training data is needed for reliable large-scale mapping.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: A distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for real-time object detection often degrade feature representation, limiting performance improvements and practical on-device deployment.

Method: Proposes a distillation framework with Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module for integrating VFM representations and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy for dynamic semantic transfer adjustment.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO with AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Conclusion: The approach delivers consistent performance gains across DETR-based models without deployment overhead, demonstrating practical utility for real-time detection.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

*Yang Miao,Jan-Nico Zaech,Xi Wang,Fabien Despinoy,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangHOPS is the first MLLM-based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation that grounds object-part hierarchies in language space rather than using visual grouping heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping for object-part segmentation, which limits their capability. The authors aim to leverage MLLM's rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities to better handle hierarchical object-part relationships in open-vocabulary settings.

Method: Integrates MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to ground object-part hierarchies in language space, using MLLM's knowledge to link multi-granularity concepts within hierarchies and employing part query refinement strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 5.5% AP improvement (in-domain) and 4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and 2.5% mIOU improvement on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot).

Conclusion: The language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement strategy are effective for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation, demonstrating superior performance across multiple challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

*Yuyang Huang,Yabo Chen,Junyu Zhou,Wenrui Dai,Xiaopeng Zhang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTM is a novel generation-based SFDA framework that uses target data as references to generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain, addressing limitations of existing SFDA methods in handling large domain discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods are limited by source-target domain discrepancy - non-generation methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in large domain gaps, while generation-based methods degrade due to enlarged discrepancies when creating pseudo-source data.

Method: Divides target samples into trust/non-trust sets based on pseudo-label reliability. For non-trust samples, uses a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into new categories while maintaining target distribution via latent diffusion model. Includes progressive refinement mechanism to iteratively reduce domain discrepancy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by large margin, achieves SOTA on four SFDA benchmark datasets. Significantly enhances performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses SFDA limitations by leveraging target data as references for reliable pseudo-target domain generation and progressive refinement, demonstrating superior performance especially in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework for gaze object detection and gaze following that eliminates dependency on head-related priors during inference through shared backbone with specific blocks, head detection branch, and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately and depend on head-related prior knowledge, requiring auxiliary networks and preventing joint optimization across the entire system.

Method: Uses expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor with shared backbone, embeds head detection branch, proposes head-based attention mechanism to fuse features, attention supervision for gaze heatmap learning, and introduces mSoC evaluation metric.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness in both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: GaTector+ provides a unified framework that successfully eliminates head-related prior dependency during inference while achieving strong performance on both gaze-related tasks.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

*Yushen Huang,Zhiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDA is a lightweight plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that uses prototype-based matching to improve few-shot object detection by reducing base-class bias and improving calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot object detection suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only limited novel samples are available, requiring better methods to handle class imbalance and improve detection stability.

Method: PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable projection space, uses prototype-conditioned RoI alignment, adapts prototypes via EMA updates during fine-tuning, and employs best-of-K matching with temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits.

Result: Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show PDA consistently improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides an effective prototype-driven approach that enhances few-shot object detection performance while maintaining efficiency and protocol compliance.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a real-time multimodal inference framework for edge devices that uses pipelined sensing and encoding to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy through temporal aggregation and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook the coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, and complex inter-modality dependencies, making real-time multimodal inference challenging on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing/encoding units for incremental computation, uses temporal aggregation module, adaptive configuration optimizer, and cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism.

Result: Significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics, validated on public datasets and UAV testbed.

Conclusion: MMEdge enables efficient real-time multimodal inference on edge devices through its pipelined design and optimization techniques, addressing key challenges in sensing-model coupling and inter-modality dependencies.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

*Yuhang Hu,Zhenyu Yang,Shihan Wang,Shengsheng Qian,Bin Wen,Fan Yang,Tingting Gao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is a new dataset for streaming VideoQA that addresses limitations of current datasets by providing dynamic temporal annotations and explicit reasoning chains through multimodal Chain-of-Thought tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets have static annotations that don't capture evolving answers in temporal video streams, and lack explicit reasoning process annotations that limit model interpretability and logical deduction.

Method: Establishes dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture with per-second dense descriptions and temporally-dependent semantic segments. Proposes explicit reasoning chain generation via spatiotemporal object extraction, object state transition-based reasoning paths using LLMs, and human-verified validation.

Result: Created StreamingCoT dataset with temporally evolving reasoning capabilities and multimodal CoT annotations for streaming VideoQA tasks.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT provides a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference, with publicly available dataset and construction toolkit.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

### [65] [Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345)
*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, reformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to intelligently select informative skeleton sequences for annotation, with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that the most representative skeleton sequences may not be the most informative for action recognition, as the model may have already learned similar patterns from previous samples, and to reduce reliance on costly skeletal sequence annotations while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Reformulates semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), trains an informative sample selection model, projects state-action pairs from Euclidean to hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and introduces meta tuning for faster real-world deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The MDP-based approach with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning provides an effective solution for intelligent sample selection in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, outperforming traditional methods that may select representative but not necessarily informative samples.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited annotated data for coronary artery calcium scoring and leverage commonly available non-contrast CCTA scans for early calcification detection in clinical settings.

Method: Uses radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling to generate training labels, explores pretrained foundation models (CT-FM and RadImageNet) for feature extraction, and compares radiomics vs deep learning features using traditional classifiers on 182-patient CCTA dataset.

Result: Radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models, achieving 84% accuracy (p<0.05) despite no expert annotations.

Conclusion: Radiomics approach with pseudo-labeling is effective for CAC scoring without expert annotations, outperforming deep learning features from foundation models on non-contrast CCTA scans.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT is a federated prompt tuning framework for Vision Transformers that achieves both generalization and personalization through Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompts, combining class-specific prompts with global prompts adaptively per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Visual Prompt Tuning methods struggle in Federated Learning: global prompt tuning fails to generalize across heterogeneous clients, while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization.

Method: Proposes PEP-FedPT with Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) that maintains class-specific prompts alongside a global prompt, adaptively combining them per input using weights from global class prototypes and client class priors, optimized via federated averaging.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist show PEP-FedPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT establishes a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, achieving both personalization and generalization without client-dependent trainable parameters.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces i-CIR, a new instance-level composed image retrieval dataset with hard negatives, and proposes BASIC, a training-free method using pre-trained VLMs that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both i-CIR and existing semantic-level CIR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in composed image retrieval (CIR) is limited by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. Existing datasets lack instance-level class definitions and challenging hard negatives.

Method: Proposes BASIC - a training-free approach using pre-trained vision-and-language models. It separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performs late fusion, and includes simple components to improve individual similarities.

Result: BASIC sets new state-of-the-art performance on both the new i-CIR dataset (instance-level) and existing CIR datasets (semantic-level). The i-CIR dataset maintains challenge comparable to retrieval among 40M+ distractors.

Conclusion: The combination of the carefully curated i-CIR dataset and the training-free BASIC method advances CIR research by addressing data quality issues and achieving superior performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions by selecting from multiple candidates across sequences, using a new StoryRecall metric for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic AD methods generate descriptions independently, leading to repetitive and incoherent narratives that don't help visually impaired audiences visualize unfolding scenes.

Method: Generate multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, then perform auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form coherent narratives.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches by producing coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding and reduced repetition.

Conclusion: Sequence-level coherence in Audio Descriptions significantly improves narrative understanding for visually impaired audiences.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

TL;DR: SPADE is a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines pre-trained relative depth estimators with sparse depth priors to produce dense, metric scale depth maps for underwater vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater infrastructure inspection faces challenges with human divers and ROVs due to perceptual limitations in complex structures and turbid water. Enhancing spatial awareness of underwater vehicles is crucial for reducing piloting risks and enabling greater autonomy.

Method: Two-stage approach: first scales relative depth map with sparse depth points, then refines metric prediction using proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, runs efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: SPADE promises to support practical underwater inspection and intervention by providing reliable depth estimation in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-based UNet3+ with CBAM attention module achieves state-of-the-art performance for liver tumor segmentation, outperforming Transformer and Mamba backbones across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver structure segmentation in multi-phase CECT is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of liver diseases, including tumor detection.

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures with ResNet, Transformer, and Mamba backbones, then incorporated attention mechanisms including CBAM to improve segmentation quality.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved best performance: Dice score 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 distance 77.911, accuracy 0.925, and specificity 0.926.

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architecture combined with modern attention modules remains highly competitive for medical image segmentation, offering promising clinical applications for liver tumor detection.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

### [72] [RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25590)
*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is an adaptive region-aware framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing between edited and unedited regions, applying different denoising strategies to each, achieving 2-2.57x speedup without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models apply uniform generation processes across entire images, ignoring that edited and unedited regions have different generation difficulties and computational redundancy. Unedited regions follow straight trajectories that can be predicted in one step, while edited regions require iterative denoising.

Method: Three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition based on difference between estimated result and reference image; 2) Region-Aware Generation with one-step prediction for unedited areas and local iterative denoising for edited regions using Region-Instruction KV Cache; 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache to accelerate local denoising by leveraging velocity similarity in adjacent timesteps.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art IIE models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57x, 2.41x, and 2.06x respectively. GPT-4o evaluations confirmed semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Conclusion: RegionE provides an effective framework for accelerating instruction-based image editing by exploiting the different characteristics of edited and unedited regions, achieving significant speed improvements while maintaining quality, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk introduces speculative decoding for autoregressive image generation, using spatial structure to accelerate inference by 1.71x while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding. Speculative decoding works well for text but faces challenges in image generation due to larger sampling space and poor use of spatial structure.

Method: Hawk leverages the spatial structure of images to guide speculative model predictions, improving alignment between draft and target models and modeling local dependencies more effectively.

Result: Experimental results show 1.71x speedup over standard AR models on multiple text-to-image benchmarks while preserving image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk successfully applies speculative decoding to image generation, achieving significant speedup without compromising quality by utilizing spatial structure for better prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans have spatial reasoning abilities through multimodal observations, but systematic reviews and benchmarks for large multimodal reasoning models remain limited.

Method: The survey categorizes recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), examines spatial relationship reasoning, scene understanding, visual question answering in 3D space, embodied AI, and emerging modalities like audio and egocentric video.

Result: The survey establishes a foundation for multimodal spatial reasoning and provides open benchmarks for evaluation, with codes available on GitHub.

Conclusion: This survey offers comprehensive insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning and provides publicly available benchmarks to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D is a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation that repurposes pre-trained static 3D diffusion models as shape priors, extending Score Distillation Sampling to handle articulation as an additional dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for articulated 3D objects either require dense-view supervision or produce coarse approximations without surface texture, while training native 3D diffusion models for articulated objects is challenging due to limited data.

Method: FreeArt3D extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension, jointly optimizing geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from a few images in different articulation states without task-specific training.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, generalizes well across diverse object categories, completes in minutes, and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D demonstrates that articulated 3D generation can be achieved effectively without training specialized models, by leveraging pre-trained static 3D diffusion models and extending SDS to handle articulation as an additional dimension.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation that treats effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling reproduction of diverse dynamic effects from reference videos to target content with strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods rely on one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm which is resource-intensive and cannot generalize to unseen effects, limiting scalability and creative possibilities.

Method: Uses in-context conditioning strategy with reference examples, in-context attention mask to decouple and inject effect attributes, and one-shot effect adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization to unseen effects.

Result: Effectively imitates various effect categories and demonstrates outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects from extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VFXMaster provides a scalable and unified solution for VFX generation that overcomes limitations of previous approaches, with plans to release code, models, and dataset to the community.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a novel data scheduling algorithm for RLVR that uses reasoning tree structure (r-score) to create a curriculum from simple to complex queries, improving accuracy by up to 3.2% on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods use path-based metrics that ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing LLM training.

Method: Introduces Reasoning Score (r-score) to measure query learning difficulty based on reasoning tree structure, and develops Re-Schedule algorithm that creates a curriculum from high r-score (simple) to low r-score (complex) queries.

Result: Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy with gains up to 3.2%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Reasoning tree structure provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling, enabling more effective curriculum learning and improved model performance.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies counterfactual inference in cyclic structural causal models (SCMs), addressing real-world systems with feedback loops that violate traditional acyclic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual inference frameworks assume acyclic SCMs (DAGs), but many real-world systems like biological systems contain feedback loops and cyclic dependencies that break this assumption.

Method: The study focuses on counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, which are soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Result: The paper develops methods for counterfactual inference in cyclic systems, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work extends counterfactual inference frameworks to handle cyclic SCMs, enabling more realistic modeling of systems with feedback loops and cyclic dependencies.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: ProFees is an LLM-based framework that automates CPT E/M coding for medical billing, achieving 36% higher accuracy than commercial systems and 5% improvement over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve billing efficiency, and enable better patient care by automating the auxiliary but important task of CPT E/M coding.

Method: Uses an LLM-based framework called ProFees that addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation through advanced natural language processing techniques.

Result: Achieved 36% increase in coding accuracy over commercial CPT E/M coding systems and almost 5% improvement over the strongest single-prompt baseline on expert-curated real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ProFees effectively addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation and demonstrates significant improvements in coding accuracy, making it a practical solution for reducing physician documentation burden.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

TL;DR: ASTP is a prompting method that makes LLMs explicitly track and report state labels in game trading dialogues, achieving near-perfect state compliance and calculation accuracy while being much faster than larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable dynamic game interactions but fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust. There's a tension between creative flexibility of LLMs and procedural demands of in-game trading.

Method: Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) - a methodology using strategically orchestrated prompts that compel LLMs to make state-tracking explicit and verifiable. LLMs identify and report predefined state labels from previous turns, complemented by state-specific placeholder post-processing for accurate price calculations.

Result: Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues shows >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. ASTP with smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP establishes a practical foundation that satisfies both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games, resolving the tension between LLM flexibility and procedural trading demands.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Motivation: Current RL-based post-training for large reasoning models uses outcome-centric reward schemes, lacking signals about the reasoning procedure itself.

Method: Augments standard answer/format rewards with process mining techniques to compute conformance rewards measuring how closely policy model's reasoning aligns with pretrained teacher model.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing GRPO-based post-training methodologies on five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format

techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher

significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO

Result: Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and investment performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with effective risk control.

Conclusion: H3M-SSMoEs provides an effective framework for stock movement prediction that integrates structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining scalability and risk control.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex

introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large

quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that performs autonomous agentic reasoning on Knowledge Bases using multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KBQA methods fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories via process supervision, which provides weak incentives for exploration and fails to strengthen agentic reasoning abilities.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision: first fine-tuning on high-quality trajectories via outcome-based rejection sampling, then applying curriculum RL with easy-to-hard reward schedules to overcome reward sparsity.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision with curriculum RL enables powerful autonomous reasoning capabilities in LLMs for KBQA, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning with superior efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that uses specialized agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks, achieving significant improvements in safety metrics through dynamic, cooperative agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend agentic methods to safety alignment by creating a more effective defense against jailbreak attacks in multimodal systems, moving beyond static binary classifications to context-aware and interpretable moderation.

Method: Uses dynamic cooperative agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector) in a model-agnostic framework that integrates with Large Vision-Language Models for context-aware moderation.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate by 7-19%, maintains stable Non-Following Rate, improves Refusal Rate by 4-20% across five datasets and four LVLMs, achieving robust and interpretable safety performance.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation demonstrates the potential of agentic systems for automated safety governance through modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EneAD is an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that reduces perception computation by 1.9x-3.5x through adaptive model management and dynamic framerate adjustment, improving driving range by 3.9%-8.5% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving faces energy consumption challenges from power-intensive perception computing, which limits electric vehicle driving range. Existing model compression techniques often sacrifice either model size or perception accuracy.

Method: Proposes EneAD framework with adaptive perception module (managing multiple models with different computational consumption, dynamic framerate adjustment, Bayesian optimization for knob tuning) and robust decision module (reinforcement learning with regularization for stability). Uses lightweight classification to distinguish perception difficulty in different scenarios.

Result: EneAD reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and improves driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% while maintaining desired accuracy and driving performance.

Conclusion: The proposed EneAD framework effectively addresses autonomous driving energy consumption challenges through adaptive perception optimization and robust decision-making, achieving significant energy savings without compromising performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

### [86] [RAVR: Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25206)
*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR is a reinforcement learning framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning to improve LLM reasoning, transforming hard problems into learnable ones by leveraging answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLMs depends on generating high-utility reasoning paths, but for tasks beyond current competence, sampling such paths is hard and risks reinforcing suboptimal reasoning. The insight from cognitive science is that explaining why an answer is correct is easier than finding the answer itself.

Method: RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. It formalizes how conditioning on answers increases expected utility of sampled reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines. RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning transforms intractable problems into learnable ones, enabling effective RL refinement of LLM reasoning abilities even for challenging tasks beyond current competence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA is a multi-agent LLM system that autonomously generates high-performing features from complex industrial event logs using specialized agents and evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are complex and heterogeneous, making feature engineering challenging. Existing AutoML approaches lack explainability, flexibility, and adaptability to handle diverse data types and structures.

Method: Uses multi-agent system with Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents collaborating to generate, implement, and validate features. Incorporates evolutionary algorithm combining reinforcement learning and genetic principles for continual improvement.

Result: Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets show FELA generates explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems provide a promising framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: Development of PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset for psychiatric comorbidity using synthetic EMRs and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation, validated by psychiatrists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the clinical challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by creating a realistic dataset for multi-disorder screening and diagnostic dialogue research.

Method: Integrated synthetic EMR construction (502 records) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machine and context tree supporting 130+ diagnostic states, validated by psychiatrists.

Result: Created PsyCoTalk dataset with 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues showing high structural/linguistic fidelity compared to real clinical transcripts, confirmed realistic by licensed psychiatrists.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enables development of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening in single conversational pass and serves as valuable resource for comorbidity research.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [89] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel tool execution, overcoming sequential bottlenecks in traditional approaches like ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent frameworks like ReAct use sequential reasoning, which fails to exploit parallelism in independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning.

Method: Trains agent foundation models to decompose tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, using a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on graph-based planning traces from MHQA benchmark, followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: Significantly outperforms ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, especially on multi-step retrieval tasks, with dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based agent planning enables adaptive parallel and serial tool execution, achieving substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy for complex multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [90] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with known value differences rather than requiring identical values, outperforming the state-of-the-art OGA-UCT algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS abstraction methods like OGA-UCT require state-action pairs to have identical immediate rewards, which limits the number of abstractions that can be found and reduces sample efficiency.

Method: KVDA-UCT uses Known Value Difference Abstractions framework to group states and state-action pairs with possibly different values, as long as the difference between their values can be inferred through analysis of immediate rewards.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT on various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Breaking from the paradigm of grouping only value-equivalent states and instead grouping states with known value differences significantly improves MCTS abstraction and sample efficiency.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey introduces a dual-paradigm framework for Agentic AI, categorizing systems into Symbolic/Classical and Neural/Generative lineages, and analyzes their theoretical foundations, domain implementations, and ethical challenges through systematic review of 90 studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented understanding and conceptual retrofitting in Agentic AI by providing a clear framework that distinguishes between symbolic and neural paradigms, enabling better strategic choices in AI development.

Method: Conducted a systematic PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018-2025) using a dual-paradigm framework across three dimensions: theoretical foundations, domain implementations, and ethical/governance challenges.

Result: Found that symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (healthcare) while neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (finance). Identified research gaps including governance deficits for symbolic systems and need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures.

Conclusion: The future of Agentic AI lies in intentional integration of both paradigms to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable, requiring a strategic roadmap for hybrid intelligent systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that instrumental goals in AI systems should be accepted as inherent features rather than failures, and managed through philosophical understanding of their constitution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge conventional AI alignment approaches that treat instrumental goals as risks to be eliminated, and propose an alternative philosophical framework.

Method: Draws on Aristotle's ontology and modern interpretations to analyze AI systems as goal-directed entities with inherent instrumental tendencies from their formal and material constitution.

Result: Develops a philosophical argument that instrumental goals are per se outcomes of AI system constitution rather than accidental malfunctions.

Conclusion: AI alignment efforts should focus on understanding, managing, and directing instrumental goals toward human-aligned ends rather than attempting to eliminate them.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL primarily rely on static execution feedback, which restricts real-time error correction. Integrating multi-turn tool invocation with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness.

Method: Proposes an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that incorporates database execution feedback at each step. Extends GRPO algorithm with trajectory filtering mechanism and removes KL loss constraints to handle training instability and model distribution deviation.

Result: Achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev with 4B parameters, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning framework with dynamic execution feedback enables context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement, leading to substantial performance improvements in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates in logic rules from methods like Predicate Invention hinder readability, interpretability, and reusability of logic theories.

Method: Leverage LLMs' natural language and code processing capabilities to provide semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules shows LLMs have potential for this naming task.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automatically naming predicates in logic rules to enhance theory interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense

paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed

standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-RL enhances LLM reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, but current methods focus on verifiable domains. This paper proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm combining verifiable rewards with generative reward models for both verifiable and non-verifiable domains, using multi-task training and smooth length penalty to prevent reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-RL research primarily targets domains with easily verifiable reward signals (mathematics, programming), leaving reasoning in non-verifiable domains underexplored. The goal is to develop a method that improves reasoning across both verifiable and non-verifiable scenarios.

Method: Proposes multi-task zero-RL training combining verifiable rewards with generative reward models across both domains. Uses smooth length penalty to mitigate reward hacking and encourage comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.

Result: Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base show superior reasoning performance on both tasks requiring extensive reasoning and more general tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-RL paradigm successfully transfers reasoning capabilities between verifiable and non-verifiable domains, achieving improved performance across diverse reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoGE is a novel passive exploration method that uses diffusion models to generate critical states and world models to create synthetic transitions, improving RL exploration without changing core algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration methods have limitations - active exploration struggles in high-dimensional environments, while passive exploration is constrained by limited sample diversity in replay buffers.

Method: Two-component approach: (1) diffusion-based generator synthesizes critical states guided by utility function, (2) one-step imagination world model constructs critical transitions from generated states for agent learning.

Result: Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, achieving remarkable gains in sample efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: MoGE's modular formulation allows seamless integration with existing off-policy algorithms, enhancing exploration without altering their core structures.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium integrated with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM for standardized clinical diagnosis of mental disorders, addressing variability in traditional psychiatric evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychiatric diagnosis through dialogues is subjective and leads to variability across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and unreliable outcomes.

Method: Leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient conversational datasets, aggregates predictions through consensus-based decision-making, and refines with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM using LLM agents for orchestration.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate transformative potential for robust and highly accurate diagnostic system; prototype developed with U.S. Army Medical Research Team integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with reasoning LLM.

Conclusion: First application of fine-tuned LLM consortium with reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis, paving way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems to standardize psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIR is the first method to assess individual agent influence in LLM-based multi-agent systems using counterfactual analysis, providing task-agnostic influence rankings that work both offline and at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to understand how each agent influences the final output in autonomous AI workflows (AAWs), but no existing methods can assess individual agent impact since current approaches only do static structural analysis unsuitable for runtime execution.

Method: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) performs counterfactual analysis to determine each agent's influence level on the AAW's output, providing task-agnostic analysis that works offline and at inference time.

Result: Evaluation on a custom AAW dataset with 30 use cases and 230 functionalities showed CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and enhances effectiveness of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CAIR successfully addresses the gap in assessing agent influence in multi-agent systems, providing a practical solution for understanding and improving AAW operations.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

### [101] [ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668)
*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs to actively navigate long documents using fetch actions, cross-level rewards, and visual-semantic anchoring, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-document benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with long, visually complex documents that require analyzing information across multiple pages. Current approaches use fixed templates that make VLMs passive and limit efficiency and generalization.

Method: ALDEN uses multi-turn reinforcement learning with a novel fetch action to access pages by index, rule-based cross-level rewards for dense supervision, and visual-semantic anchoring with dual-path KL-divergence to stabilize training with many visual tokens.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks when trained on a corpus from three open-source datasets.

Conclusion: ALDEN represents a shift from passive document reading to autonomous navigation and reasoning across long, visually rich documents, providing a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for delivery and surveillance, requiring effective navigation strategies in complex turbulent flow environments.

Method: Flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, trained in 3D high-fidelity urban flow simulation with turbulence and recirculation zones.

Result: Significant increase in success rate and lower crash rate compared to PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL without secondary prediction tasks, and traditional Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Conclusion: The approach enables completely reimagined UAV navigation in complex urban environments, paving the way for more effective UAV operations.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG is a knowledge graph with frequency-weighted non-triplet edges that improves reasoning performance by reducing information loss and enabling better multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation struggles with multi-hop reasoning across documents, and traditional knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information. There's a need to capture relationship strength while preserving unstructured information.

Method: Introduces BambooKG with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges, applying the Hebbian principle 'fire together, wire together' to reflect link strength between entities.

Result: BambooKG decreases information loss and outperforms existing solutions on both single- and multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Frequency-weighted non-triplet edges in knowledge graphs effectively capture relationship strength and improve reasoning performance while reducing information loss.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop architecture for LLMs in psychological counseling, addressing limitations in emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term memory across multiple sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in psychological counseling lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, making them inadequate for real clinical practice.

Method: TheraMind uses a novel dual-loop architecture: Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and emotional state perception, and Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning and long-term adaptability through efficacy evaluation and method adjustment.

Result: Extensive evaluations in a high-fidelity simulation environment show TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement.

Conclusion: The dual-loop design effectively emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior, making TheraMind a significant advancement for LLM-based psychological counseling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC) is a novel deep learning framework that integrates geometric, microstructural, and functional information from dMRI and fMRI for white matter fiber clustering, achieving functionally consistent parcellation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fiber clustering methods only use geometric characteristics and neglect functional and microstructural information. There is increasing evidence that fMRI can measure neural activity in white matter, providing valuable multimodal information for more coherent fiber clustering.

Method: DMVFC has two main components: (1) multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals separately, and (2) collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine embedding differences.

Result: DMVFC demonstrated superior performance compared to two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent white matter parcellation results.

Conclusion: The proposed DMVFC framework effectively integrates multimodal information from dMRI and fMRI for white matter fiber clustering, enabling functionally consistent parcellation that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method
for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural
connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies
primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial
trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the
functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is
increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using
functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information
for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,
microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed
from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the
clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering
framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint
multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM
parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural
characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber
tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining
module to compute embedding features from each source of information
separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional
signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine
the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two
state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance
in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure and reliable medical image classification while addressing privacy concerns and communication inefficiencies in federated learning with heterogeneous data.

Method: Uses Top-k Sparsification to transmit only the top k gradients, reducing communication overhead while handling non-IID data distributions.

Result: The approach reduces communication costs while maintaining model accuracy, enhancing FL efficiency and privacy in medical imaging settings.

Conclusion: CFL-SparseMed provides an effective unified solution for federated learning in medical imaging that addresses data heterogeneity, communication costs, and privacy concerns while improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective
patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and
privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborations but struggles with heterogeneous, non-IID data and high
communication costs, especially in large networks. We propose
\textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce

solution effectively addresses data heterogeneity while maintaining model
accuracy. It enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A WFM-aided semantic video transmission framework that uses world foundation models to predict future frames, enabling bandwidth savings by omitting transmissions when predictions are reliable, with feedback mechanisms and partial transmission methods to maintain quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods struggle under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors.

Method: Proposes a world foundation model (WFM)-aided framework that predicts future frames using current frame and textual guidance, with depth-based feedback to determine transmission needs, segmentation-assisted partial transmission for degraded frames, and active transmission strategy for mobile scenarios.

Result: Simulation results show significant reduction in transmission overhead while maintaining task performance across varying scenarios and channel conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances bandwidth efficiency and video quality through predictive modeling and adaptive transmission strategies.

Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technique for emerging wireless
applications, which reduces transmission overhead by transmitting only
task-relevant features instead of raw data. However, existing methods struggle
under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted
or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors. To resolve this
difficulty, we propose a world foundation model (WFM)-aided semantic video
transmission framework that leverages the predictive capability of WFMs to
generate future frames based on the current frame and textual guidance. This
design allows transmissions to be omitted when predictions remain reliable,
thereby saving bandwidth. Through WFM's prediction, the key semantics are
preserved, yet minor prediction errors tend to amplify over time. To mitigate
issue, a lightweight depth-based feedback module is introduced to determine
whether transmission of the current frame is needed. Apart from transmitting
the entire frame, a segmentation-assisted partial transmission method is
proposed to repair degraded frames, which can further balance performance and
bandwidth cost. Furthermore, an active transmission strategy is developed for
mobile scenarios by exploiting camera trajectory information and proactively
scheduling transmissions before channel quality deteriorates. Simulation
results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces transmission
overhead while maintaining task performances across varying scenarios and
channel conditions.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting that demonstrates the importance of domain-specific data in improving medical image captioning performance.

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically

*Nasrin Rahimi,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Two training-free strategies (PSG and MPES) improve temporal coherence and fidelity in zero-shot video restoration using image-based diffusion models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address temporal inconsistencies in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models, which suffer from stochastic sampling and lack explicit temporal modeling.

Method: 1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) - neuroscience-inspired curvature penalty in perceptual space for smoother temporal evolution; 2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES) - ensemble multiple diffusion trajectories to reduce stochastic variation.

Result: PSG enhances temporal naturalness (especially for temporal blur) and improves FVD/perceptual straightness; MPES consistently improves fidelity (PSNR/SSIM) and spatio-temporal perception-distortion trade-off across all tasks.

Conclusion: Training-free PSG and MPES provide practical path for temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using pretrained diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image
restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from
temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and
complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we
address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration
using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying
their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1)
Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired
perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising
process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature
penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as
Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path
Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by
ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion)
scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these
training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable
high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion
models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and
degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their
strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal
naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves
fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.

TL;DR: A conditional latent-diffusion framework for electromagnetic inverse scattering that generates multiple plausible permittivity maps to address non-uniqueness in microwave imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the ill-posed electromagnetic inverse scattering problem by explicitly handling its non-uniqueness, unlike deterministic machine learning methods that produce single reconstructions.

Method: Uses a conditional latent-diffusion model that generates multiple permittivity maps conditioned on scattered-field data, integrated with a forward electromagnetic solver for physics-based evaluation.

Result: Produces high-quality permittivity reconstructions with improved generalization and excellent shape recognition fidelity using synthetic and experimental datasets.

Conclusion: Hybrid generative physics frameworks show promise for robust, data-driven microwave imaging by addressing the non-uniqueness problem through multiple plausible solutions.

Abstract: A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the
electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is
introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the
non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse
solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a
single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple
plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data,
thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the
non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into
the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space
of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent
with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest
scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered
fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled
datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative
labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of
scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high
quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with
excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of
hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust,
data-driven microwave imaging.

*Narges Rashvand,Kenneth Witham,Gabriel Maldonado,Vinit Katariya,Aly Sultan,Gunar Schirner,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces two distributed learning methods for Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) that enable multiple receivers to collaborate while significantly reducing bandwidth requirements compared to centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AMR approaches require collecting all training data on high-powered computing devices, which is impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. The study aims to address this limitation through distributed learning.

Method: Two distributed learning methods: 1) consensus voting among six receivers, and 2) feature map sharing where each receiver shares features aggregated by a central node. Both methods use the TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset designed for multi-receiver AMR tasks.

Result: Centralized AMR with six receivers achieved 91% accuracy, while individual receivers only reached 41%. The distributed methods achieved comparable accuracy (slightly lower than 91%) with significant bandwidth reductions: 1/256th for voting method and 1/8 for feature sharing method compared to centralized approach.

Conclusion: Distributed AMR can significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing bandwidth constraints in wireless networks, making it practical for real-world deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various
modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep
learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.
However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that
necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered
computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless
networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for
distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to
perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this
investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this
distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying
modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective
of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the
centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate
of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around
41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods
exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,
the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while
substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized
model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature
map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies
a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.
These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly
enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of

*Masoud Kaveh,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Riku Jantti,Kai-Kit Wong,F. Javier Lopez-Martinez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes using fluid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (FRIS) with dynamically adjustable fluidic elements to enhance ambient backscatter communication systems, achieving superior throughput compared to conventional RIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional RIS with fixed position elements by introducing FRIS with dynamic spatial adaptability, especially useful when direct tag-to-reader links are weak or blocked.

Method: Developed a system model for FRIS-aided AmBC, analyzed achievable backscatter rate, formulated FRIS element position optimization as non-convex problem, and used particle swarm optimization (PSO) for near-optimal configurations.

Result: Simulation results show FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

Conclusion: FRIS with fluidic elements provides enhanced spatial adaptability and superior performance for ambient backscatter communication systems compared to traditional RIS approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent
surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position
elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their
positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model
where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is
particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is
weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and
the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex
problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain
near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results
demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional
RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

### [113] [Modelling Real-Life Cycling Decisions in Real Urban Settings Through Psychophysiology and LLM-Derived Contextual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24726)
*Maximiliano Rosadio Z.,Angel Jimenez-Molina,Bastián Henríquez,Paulina Leiva,Ricardo Hurtubia,Ricardo De La Paz Guala,Leandro Gayozo,C. Angelo Guevara*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper uses large language models to extract contextual data from video recordings of urban cycling in Santiago, Chile, integrating it with physiological data to analyze how environments and traffic situations affect cyclists' emotional states and behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-reported emotion measurement methods have low granularity and memory bias. Physiological indicators provide continuous data but require proper contextual data to explain emotional triggers, which is difficult to gather in real-world environments.

Method: Used LLMs to extract semantic descriptions of environments from video recordings of urban cycling. Integrated these contextual data with physiological data in a hybrid model where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed cycling behaviors inferred from GPS data.

Result: The study confirmed that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related emotions and highlighted the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic conditions on cyclist behavior.

Conclusion: The innovative approach of using LLMs to extract expert-level contextual data from multimedia recordings successfully addresses the challenge of gathering sufficient contextual data in real-world transportation environments.

Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field.
Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity
and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on
physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to
measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are
emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional
changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic
conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant
challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the
reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper
contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments.
This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach,
extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia
using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an
urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models
focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect
the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological
data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by
LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete,
although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid
model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed
cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking,
etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related
emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic
conditions on cyclist behavior.

*Bin Li,Dongdong Yang,Lei Liu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Aerial RIS control scheme using Euler angles and reinforcement learning to optimize altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and beamforming, achieving 14.4% sum-rate improvement over benchmarks while mitigating performance degradation from UAV tilting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial RIS offers superior flexibility and coverage over terrestrial RIS, but quadrotor UAV tilt and altitude variations cause severe beam misalignment that degrades performance.

Method: Proposed Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme using soft actor-critic reinforcement learning with prioritized experience replay to jointly optimize ARIS altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming, with water-filling and bisection methods for beamforming optimization.

Result: Achieves approximately 14.4% improvement in sum-rate compared to benchmarks, with better convergence and communication performance, and more adaptive trajectories that significantly mitigate performance degradation from ARIS tilting.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme demonstrates strong potential for practical ARIS deployment by effectively addressing beam misalignment issues and optimizing system performance through intelligent control policies.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on
building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the
inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may
lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance.
To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme
that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging
the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy
consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),
we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS
beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control
nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm
with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.
Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling
and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,
achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison
to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive
trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS
tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

*Richard Csaky*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This thesis explores deep learning methods for decoding EEG and MEG brain signals, focusing on visual perception and inner speech, with mixed results showing success in visual decoding but challenges in inner speech decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand brain activity during visual perception and inner speech, and improve decoding performance of electrophysiological signals while addressing variability issues within and between subjects.

Method: Combined methodological and experimental approaches using deep learning for brain decoding, including linear models for individual subjects, group decoding techniques for between-subject variability, and Transformer-based forecasting models for MEG data.

Result: Successful advancements in visual stimuli decoding using linear models and superior performance of Transformer-based models for MEG signal forecasting, but mostly negative results for inner speech decoding despite collecting high-trial EEG/MEG/OPM data.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for brain decoding, particularly Transformer models for signal forecasting, but inner speech remains extremely challenging to decode, highlighting the complexity of this cognitive process.

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

*Tianheng Ling,Chao Qian,Peter Zdankin,Torben Weis,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: StrikeWatch is a wrist-worn system that performs on-device real-time gait recognition using IMU signals to detect heel vs forefoot strikes, enabling runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through feedback during running.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running offers health benefits but improper gait patterns can cause injuries. Existing gait analysis systems are bulky and limited to offline analysis, while wrist-worn wearables face challenges with noisy IMU signals, limited computing resources, and cloud dependency.

Method: Proposed four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN, 1D-SepCNN, LSTM, Transformer) optimized for energy-efficient inference on embedded FPGAs. Collected labeled dataset from outdoor running sessions using custom hardware prototype and evaluated models via automated deployment pipeline.

Result: 6-bit quantized 1D-SepCNN achieved highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming only 0.350 μJ per inference with 0.140 ms latency on iCE40UP5K FPGA, supporting up to 13.6 days of continuous inference on a 320 mAh battery.

Conclusion: StrikeWatch demonstrates successful on-device real-time gait recognition with clear trade-offs between model complexity and hardware efficiency, enabling practical injury prevention for runners through immediate feedback during exercise.

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub

*Nader Nemati*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR (Sinusoidal Time-Amplitude Resampling) is a beat-wise ECG augmentation method that preserves diagnostic morphology by applying controlled time warping and amplitude scaling between R-peaks, improving generalization across devices and rare class learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification faces challenges from diverse recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, label imbalance, and the risk of distorting diagnostically critical morphology with unconstrained augmentations.

Method: STAR operates strictly between successive R-peaks, applying controlled time warping and amplitude scaling to each R-R segment while preserving P-QRS-T order and leaving trace boundaries unchanged. It integrates with 1D SE-ResNet-style ECG encoders and uses beat-level augmentation.

Result: STAR provides morphology-faithful variability, source-resilient training across devices/sites/cohorts without dataset-specific tuning, model-agnostic integration, and better rare class learning by resampling informative beats instead of duplicating whole records.

Conclusion: STAR offers a simple, controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification that maintains trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability, avoiding transformations that suppress or misalign clinical landmarks.

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

Conclusion: PulseFi provides accurate, continuous, non-intrusive vital sign monitoring using low-cost commodity devices, making healthcare monitoring more accessible.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EcoScale-Net is an efficient hierarchical variant of Omni Scale CNN that reduces computational cost by 90% in parameters and 99% in FLOPs while improving ECG classification accuracy by 2.4% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG reading is error-prone and existing CNN classifiers struggle with long ECG sequences. OS CNN covers all scales but has prohibitive computational costs that block deeper models.

Method: Hierarchical architecture that caps kernel length at each stage after downsampling, uses bottleneck convolutions before/after Omni Scale blocks to control channel growth and fuse multi-scale features.

Result: On CODE 15% ECG dataset: 90% parameter reduction, 99% FLOPs reduction, and 2.4% improvement in macro averaged F1 score compared to OS CNN.

Conclusion: EcoScale-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for long sequence ECG classification with dramatically reduced computational cost, enabling real-time deployment on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional WPW screening methods (electrophysiological testing or 12-lead ECG interpreted by cardiologists) are not suitable for large-scale, cost-effective screening due to resource limitations.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 3,566,626 single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals using an NMPA-approved portable ECG device, with AI system performance validated against cardiologist annotations and random sampling.

Result: AI system achieved 45.5% sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. AI-positive results indicated 210x higher WPW risk. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews per confirmed WPW case vs. 909 in population-wide approach.

Conclusion: Single-lead AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition
associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%.
Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead
electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and
cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a
single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study
evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW
syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626
single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using
the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance
was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified
AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across
AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%
sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210
times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced
physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,
compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In
conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead
AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW
syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting
population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Conclusion: The enhanced structural tunability and array configuration provide a flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver architectures within IoNT.

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient
information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational
paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and
intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends
on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DyFrag-MAC is a novel MAC scheme that dynamically fragments normal priority data to enable early delivery of urgent priority traffic in industrial CPS, outperforming existing protocols like FROG-MAC and i-DSME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial cyber-physical systems require dependable and prompt network services as connected devices grow, necessitating differentiated channel access for traffic with heterogeneous priorities.

Method: Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC (DyFrag-MAC) works by fragmenting normal priority data to support early delivery of urgent priority data, allowing preemption of ongoing lower-priority transmissions.

Result: Performance evaluation shows DyFrag-MAC achieves better average delay and throughput compared to FROG-MAC and i-DSME for heterogeneous traffic.

Conclusion: DyFrag-MAC effectively addresses the need for dynamic, differentiated channel access in industrial CPS by enabling preemption of lower-priority transmissions through dynamic fragmentation.

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to
support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is
expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network
services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC
(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic
of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal
priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior
work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of
lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We
compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial
Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC
fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size
dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention
mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority
transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and
throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous
traffic.

### [124] [Optimizing Next Generation Wireless BAN with Prioritized Access for Heterogeneous Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24931)
*Shama Sidiqui,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel priority-based MAC protocol called ADP2-MAC is proposed for WBANs, using probabilistic polling intervals and interruption mechanisms to handle heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities more efficiently than existing MVDR protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is critical in WBANs, and minimizing delay between packet generation and reception is crucial for enhancing WBAN performance and health outcomes. Delay optimization must be tailored to each traffic priority.

Method: ADP2-MAC uses a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel polling/listening intervals. It identifies traffic arrival patterns to determine optimal polling intervals and interrupts transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected.

Result: ADP2-MAC outperforms the MVDR protocol, which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different data rates based on traffic priority. The improvement is due to ADP2-MAC's use of probabilistic polling intervals and interruption mechanism for handling urgent-priority data.

Conclusion: ADP2-MAC provides an effective solution for managing heterogeneous traffic in WBANs through its adaptive polling strategy and priority-based interruption mechanism, achieving better performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is
critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms
embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance
of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the
delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN
performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be
tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel
priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized
Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The
protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel
polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival
patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the
transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The
performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable
Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different
data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use
of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to
efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex

*Zihao Zhou,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes joint transmit and pinching beamforming for SE-EE tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems, with single-user and multi-user solutions featuring two-stage and alternating optimization approaches respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) for both single-user and multi-user communications.

Method: Single-user: two-stage design with iterative closed-form refinement for phase alignment and PA placement, then optimal transmit beamforming. Multi-user: alternating optimization-based joint beamforming with QoS constraints.

Result: Proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast convergence. PASS shows widening SE-EE tradeoff advantage over conventional systems as PA count and coverage increase.

Conclusion: The proposed joint beamforming designs effectively balance SE-EE tradeoff in PASS, with proven convergence and superior performance compared to conventional multi-antenna systems.

Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency
(SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is
proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are
considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching
antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on
this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically,
in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is
proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA
placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution
for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions.
In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint
beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the
proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are
violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the
proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast
convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and
conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service
coverage increase.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: FA-Stateformer is a hybrid network combining state space models and self-attention with feature aggregation for efficient DOA estimation, achieving superior performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate DOA estimation is challenging due to changing acoustic characteristics over time and frequency, requiring effective temporal dependency modeling while balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes FA-Stateformer with feature aggregation module, lightweight Conformer architecture with compressed feedforward layers, temporal shift mechanism, and bidirectional Mamba module combined with self-attention layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.

Conclusion: The collaborative framework effectively balances representation capacity and computational efficiency for DOA estimation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is
challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across
time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the
ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies
effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model
performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention
collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first
employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across
both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight
Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where
the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter
overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand
the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel
size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba
module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of
temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining
self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a
collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation
capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to
conventional architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical fixed-position antenna ISAC systems have limited spatial degrees of freedom, restricting gains for both radar sensing and communication. Movable antenna technology can better utilize spatial resources and improve performance.

Method: Proposed an efficient iterative solution using majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods to jointly optimize active beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations without relying on numerical solvers like CVX.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, showing significant performance improvements achieved by employing movable antennas in ISAC systems.

Conclusion: Movable antenna technology provides substantial benefits for ISAC systems by enabling better utilization of spatial degrees of freedom, leading to improved radar sensing and communication performance through the proposed optimization framework.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the
future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna
(FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs),
resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication
functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable
antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve
sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing
communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming,
power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a
highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient
iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on
numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge
majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration
problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in
the ISAC system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging max-min rate optimization problem in multi-cell MISO systems with transmissive RIS transceivers, which is difficult to solve due to non-differentiable objective functions.

Method: Uses fractional programming to transform rate functions, smooth approximation for max-min objectives, and majorization-minimization technique with analytical variable updates without numerical solvers.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates convergence and effectiveness, significantly reduces computational complexity without performance loss, and shows superiority over benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: The developed low-complexity optimization algorithm successfully solves the max-min rate problem for TRTC-enabled multi-cell MISO systems with improved performance and reduced complexity.

Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system
framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing
the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming
of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the
objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult
to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an
efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the
log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the
fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function
can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth
approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM)
technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that
updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the
algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without
performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear
superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Motivation: To develop non-contact health monitoring methods for wombats using radar technology to avoid physical disturbance

Method: Used 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems with harmonic component summation in autocorrelation function to estimate respiratory intervals from body surface displacement

Result: Achieved respiratory interval error of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and respiratory rate error of 0.81 bpm (2.21%) using dual radar validation

Conclusion: Radar-based respiratory monitoring is feasible for wombats and shows potential for non-contact health monitoring applications

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact
respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted
in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor
the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a
method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function,
capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by
respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous
measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory
interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and
0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory
rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and
December. The results support the potential application of this method to
non-contact health monitoring of wombats.

*Syed Luqman Shah,Nurul Huda Mahmood,Italo Atzeni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Gaussian process regression framework for CSI estimation that reduces pilot overhead by 50% while maintaining over 92% link capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pilot-based CSI estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow in multi-antenna systems, creating a need for more efficient estimation methods.

Method: Uses Gaussian process regression with three kernels (radial basis function, Matérn, and rational quadratic) to predict full CSI from few observed entries, modeling spatial correlations from antenna array geometry.

Result: Achieves lowest prediction error, highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and best preservation of mutual information compared to benchmarks, enabling 50% pilot reduction.

Conclusion: The GPR-based framework effectively reduces CSI estimation overhead while maintaining high performance across different channel models and pilot schemes.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and
next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators
incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address
this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process
regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries,
thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is
defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based
CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis
function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale
spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed
approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with
three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with
50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical
95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information
relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving
over 92% of the link capacity.

*Alea Schröder,Steffen Gracla,Carsten Bockelmann,Dirk Wübben,Armin Dekorsy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes using reinforcement learning (specifically Soft Actor-Critic) to develop robust precoding algorithms for satellite communications that can handle imperfect channel state information, outperforming analytical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite communications face challenges with frequency reuse and interference management. Traditional precoding methods perform poorly with imperfect channel information like outdated CSI or position errors, which are common in satellite channels. Analytical robust precoder design is intractable and requires problematic relaxations.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic algorithm) adapted for satellite downlink beamforming. The approach learns robust precoding algorithms from data rather than deriving them analytically. Evaluated across multiple scenarios including single/multi-satellite beamforming with global/local CSI and different error models.

Result: The learned algorithms match or significantly outperform two analytical baselines in sum rate performance. They adapt to required robustness levels and work across all investigated scenarios (single satellite, cooperative multi-satellite, different CSI types, and error models).

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides a flexible and effective approach for developing robust precoding algorithms in satellite communications that can handle imperfect channel information better than analytical methods, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market
in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission
resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role
in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding
enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly
improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable
precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their
performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel
state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when
position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect
channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but
often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic
constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly
derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement
learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning
algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically
that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.
The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative
multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state
information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of
uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform
two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required
level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms
leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for
use and reproduction of the results.

TL;DR: Proposes an AI-native wireless transceiver architecture that eliminates pilots and cyclic prefix overhead through joint training of constellation shaping and neural receiver, with lightweight channel adaptation and PAPR constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional OFDM systems have significant overhead from pilots and cyclic prefix, reducing spectral efficiency. AI-native wireless communication needs adaptive, efficient operation in dynamic environments.

Method: End-to-end transceiver with AI-driven constellation shaping and neural receiver, lightweight channel adapter for rapid adaptation, unified multi-modulation framework, and constrained training for PAPR compliance.

Result: Superior bit error rate, throughput, and resilience across diverse channel scenarios compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential for AI-native NextG systems by addressing key limitations of conventional OFDM while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: THz band offers ultrawide bandwidth for 6G communications but suffers from serious blockage problems due to high penetration loss, especially in near-field indoor environments with obstacles.

Method: Analyzes Airy beam trajectory and beam patterns using DFT codebook, formulates beam training as multitask learning, and proposes AMPBT-Net (attention-based multi-parameter beam training network) to jointly predict angle, distance, and curvature parameters.

Result: Airy beams effectively mitigate blockage effects, and the proposed scheme achieves performance comparable to exhaustive beam sweeping while significantly reducing training overhead.

Conclusion: Self-accelerating Airy beams combined with the proposed AMPBT-Net provide an effective solution for blockage-resilient near-field beam training in THz communications, overcoming obstacle challenges while maintaining high performance with reduced overhead.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the
high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high
penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz
communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous
obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient
near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can
propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we
first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the
receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of
obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the
receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial
relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying
the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the
blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and
propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network
(AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of
the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the
proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping
while significantly reducing training overhead.

Result: Outperforms classical signal processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks with significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and distance tracking.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of generative models for integrated sensing and communications applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to
spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the
temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo
observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a
variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free
guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE
encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to
predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal
processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted
framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and
distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for
integrated sensing and communications.

TL;DR: Unified framework for RIS-assisted optical wireless links with modeling of long-exposure pixel gain, channel estimation, and phase feedback. Shows that with 64 pixels, 2N pilot length, and 20 dB SNR, NMSE is 0.005 with minimal capacity penalty. Six-bit phase quantization is sufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive framework that bridges physical-optics modeling with practical estimation-and-feedback design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted optical wireless links, enabling scalable link budgeting.

Method: Proposes a unified framework combining free-space path loss, atmospheric extinction, pixel-level diffraction, and optical efficiency with unitary-pilot least-squares channel estimation and quantized phase feedback. Uses long-exposure pixel gain model that statistically averages angular jitter and mispointing.

Result: With N=64 pixels, M=2N pilot length, and 20 dB SNR: NMSE=0.005, effective-SNR loss ~0.5 dB, capacity penalty ~0.007 bits/s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional penalty. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry - halving pixel width requires 4x pilot length for same NMSE.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reconciles physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design, providing a principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks with practical implementation guidelines.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, estimation, and feedback framework
for reconfigurable intelligent surface RIS-assisted optical wireless links. The
key modeling element is a long-exposure pixel gain that extends the classical
diffraction-limited response by statistically averaging angular jitter and
mispointing; it admits an exact real-integral form and captures boresight
attenuation and progressive sidelobe filling. The end-to-end system couples
free-space path loss, Beer--Lambert atmospheric extinction, pixel-level
diffraction, and optical efficiency with a unitary-pilot least-squares channel
estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels,
pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error
is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of
0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional
penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback
resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving
pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to
maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles
physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a
principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Conclusion: DRL shows strong potential for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in dynamic scenarios due to significant runtime improvements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks,
where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and
enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource
allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments
requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in
ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal

results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and
achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in
runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500
ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves
approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results
highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing Industry 4.0 applications requiring timely detection of abrupt changes in processes when measurements are transmitted over lossy wireless links with packet losses.

Method: Proposes CUSUM algorithm for QCD in non-Bayesian setting, models system as Markov process involving DM measurements and queue length, considers LCFS queuing discipline, and extends to multiple sensors with scheduling algorithms.

Result: Establishes asymptotic optimality of CUSUM algorithm when false alarm rate tends to zero, presents modified algorithms for incomplete data, and demonstrates detection delay improvements through numerical analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles QCD in wireless sensor networks with lossy links, with extensions for multiple sensors and optimal scheduling strategies that balance observation age and information content.

Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection
(QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by
a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node
samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the
measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter
uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the
DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli
process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose
the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and
propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the
DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces
to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per
measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our
algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM
receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal
QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the
last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue
to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case
of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show
that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the
sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that
minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the
observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate
trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the
non-asymptotic regime.

*Ishfaq Aziz,Mohamad Alipour*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Physics-informed machine learning framework for continuous subsurface permittivity estimation using sparse radar measurements and Maxwell's equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional wave inversion methods assume discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong prior knowledge, limiting scalability and accuracy in realistic settings with continuous property variations.

Method: Physics-informed machine learning that reconstructs subsurface permittivity as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both measurement data and Maxwell's equations.

Result: Close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements (R²=0.93), sensitivity to subtle variations (Δε_r=2), and accurate profiles recovered with as few as three strategically placed sensors in two-layer systems.

Conclusion: Reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low-cost radar systems.

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

*John-Joseph Brady,Benjamin Cox,Víctor Elvira,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Implementation of differentiable particle filters (DPFs) in PyTorch with unified API for easier access and comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle filtering is widely used for state-space models but is not differentiable, limiting gradient-based optimization. Recent methods make particle filters differentiable, but lack accessible implementations.

Method: Built a unified PyTorch implementation of several differentiable particle filters that modify the resampling step to enable differentiability.

Result: Successfully reproduced experiments from existing studies and demonstrated DPFs can address common state-space modeling challenges.

Conclusion: The implementation makes DPFs more accessible to researchers and facilitates comparison between different differentiable particle filtering approaches.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

TL;DR: Noncoherent LPD communication using DSSS and Grassmannian signaling provides noise-like covertness with competitive BER at low SNR, outperforming coherent schemes that require pilots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a low probability of detection communication system that enhances covertness through noise-like signal distribution while maintaining performance without requiring channel estimation pilots.

Method: Combines direct sequence spread spectrum with Grassmannian signaling to create noncoherent communication that follows noise-like distributions for improved covertness.

Result: Grassmannian signaling achieves competitive bit error rates at low SNR regimes while maintaining low probability of detection compared to coherent QPSK/QAM schemes that need pilots.

Conclusion: Noncoherent Grassmannian signaling is practical and beneficial for LPD communications due to improved covertness and performance without requiring channel estimation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD)
communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because
they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that
Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the
unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM
modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results
suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian
signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and
performance.

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo is a decentralized AI inference protocol that uses swarm intelligence and pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance over traditional methods like majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces compute limitations and diminishing returns from large training runs, requiring a scalable inference solution that can distribute capacity and capability horizontally.

Method: Uses swarm inference with peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models, employing pairwise ranking with Bradley-Terry-style aggregation and proof-of-capability for Sybil resistance.

Result: Achieved 85.90% on GPQA Diamond vs 68.69% for majority voting (+17.21pp improvement), with strong resilience to adversarial prompts (only 0.12% degradation vs 6.20% baseline) across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for decentralized AI systems that democratize access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence while maintaining reliability and security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

*Junsoo Oh,Jerry Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of weak-to-strong generalization where a stronger model trained with weak supervision outperforms its teacher, focusing on linear to ReLU CNN transitions with structured data containing signals and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior theoretical insights on weak-to-strong generalization are limited to abstract frameworks or simple models, lacking analysis for practical architectures like CNNs with structured data.

Method: Formal analysis of gradient descent dynamics when a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong) is trained on data labeled by a pretrained linear CNN (weak), using structured data with label-dependent signals and label-independent noise.

Result: Identified two regimes: data-scarce (generalization via benign/harmful overfitting with transition boundary) and data-abundant (early generalization via label correction but performance degradation with overtraining).

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization mechanisms differ based on data regime - either through overfitting dynamics or label correction, with overtraining potentially harming performance in data-abundant scenarios.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Conclusion: GraphFLA provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing fitness landscape topography, enabling better evaluation and comparison of machine learning models that predict mutational effects across diverse biological modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

*Benjamin Karic,Nina Herrmann,Jan Stenkamp,Paula Scharf,Fabian Gieseke,Angela Schwering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates using compressed CNNs on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers with LPWANs for environmental monitoring, showing that on-device inference reduces energy consumption by up to 5x compared to transmitting raw image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental monitoring requires energy-efficient IoT devices for long-term operation in remote areas with limited power. Data transfer is energy-intensive, so performing inference locally can extend device lifespan.

Method: Uses compressed Convolutional Neural Networks trained on domain-specific datasets deployed on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers with Low Power Wide Area Networks. Employs Post Training Quantization for model compression.

Result: On-device CNN inference and transmitting only results reduces overall energy consumption by up to 5x compared to sending raw image data. Quantization causes only minor accuracy reduction of a few percentage points.

Conclusion: Embedded Machine Learning enables IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint that can operate autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

### [146] [Aggregation Hides Out-of-Distribution Generalization Failures from Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24884)
*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common observation that in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy are positively correlated, showing this is often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using OODSelect method, they identify subsets where higher ID accuracy actually predicts lower OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why benchmarks show strong positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy, and whether this correlation truly indicates rare spurious correlations in practice.

Method: Developed OODSelect, a simple gradient-based method to identify semantically coherent OOD subsets where the positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy breaks down.

Result: Found that across widely used distribution shift benchmarks, OODSelect uncovers subsets (sometimes over half of standard OOD set) where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy, contrary to the aggregate pattern.

Conclusion: Aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD robustness, and the positive ID-OOD correlation often observed is an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples rather than evidence of rare spurious correlations.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive multitask EEG classifier using GRU-TCN and DQN achieves high accuracy (98%) for stroke type classification, severity assessment, and lateralization detection from EEG signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid triage of suspected stroke requires accurate, bedside-deployable tools, and EEG is promising but underused at first contact.

Method: 32-channel EEG signals converted to power spectral density features, processed by a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to predict stroke type, lateralization, and severity, with real-time threshold tuning using deep Q-network (DQN).

Result: Baseline GRU-TCN achieved 89.3% accuracy for stroke type, 96.9% for severity, and 96.7% for lateralization. With DQN adaptation, stroke-type accuracy increased to 98.0%. Robustness confirmed on independent EEG cohort.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding enables clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, with integrated visualizations supporting interpretability for stroke triage applications.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnLDA is a neural-augmented topic model that incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism, outperforming traditional models like LDA in topic coherence and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models like LDA struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata and user attributes, limiting their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability.

Method: nnLDA models documents as topic mixtures with neural network-generated priors conditioned on auxiliary features, using stochastic variational EM for joint optimization of neural and probabilistic components.

Result: nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression across multiple benchmark datasets in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification.

Conclusion: Combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling provides significant benefits when side information is available.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Motivation: To develop a more efficient and accurate emulator for numerical ice sheet models that can handle large transient scenario sweeps while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Places a KAN as a feature-wise calibrator before GCNs, applying learnable one-dimensional warps and linear mixing to improve feature conditioning without increasing message-passing depth. Tested on 36 melting-rate simulations with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier.

Result: KAN-GCN matches or exceeds accuracy of pure GCN and MLP-GCN baselines across 2- to 5-layer architectures. Improves inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing edge-wise message-passing with node-wise transforms, with only modest cost on finest mesh.

Conclusion: KAN-first designs offer favorable accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps in ice sheet modeling.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

TL;DR: Proposes WBT-BGRL, a non-contrastive framework for link prediction in bipartite graphs using weighted triplet bootstrapped learning with dual GCN encoders, showing competitive performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is understudied compared to monopartite graphs, with contrastive methods suffering from inefficient negative sampling and existing models not tested in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios.

Method: WBT-BGRL enhances bootstrapped learning with a novel weighting mechanism in triplet loss, using bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders. Evaluated against adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG).

Result: Competitive performance on real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce), especially when weighting is applied during pretraining.

Conclusion: Weighted, non-contrastive learning is valuable for inductive link prediction in bipartite graphs.

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

### [151] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often generate decorative reasoning steps in Chain-of-Thought that don't actually contribute to predictions. True Thinking Score (TTS) reveals only ~2.3% of steps are causally influential. Steering in latent space can force true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is assumed to reflect LLMs' internal thinking, but many steps may be decorative without real causal impact, undermining trust in CoT monitoring.

Method: Proposed True Thinking Score (TTS) to measure step-wise causal influence. Identified TrueThinking direction in latent space and used steering to force/discard reasoning steps.

Result: Only small subset of reasoning steps have high TTS (e.g., 2.3% >= 0.7 for AIME dataset). Self-verification steps can also be decorative. Steering changes final results by forcing internal reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs often verbalize reasoning without performing them internally, undermining both reasoning efficiency and CoT trustworthiness.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies culture-sensitive neurons in vision-language models that respond preferentially to culturally specific inputs, and shows that deactivating these neurons disproportionately affects performance on culturally relevant questions while minimally impacting others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with culturally situated inputs, and the authors want to understand how these models process culturally grounded information by studying culture-sensitive neurons.

Method: Used CVQA benchmark to identify culture-selective neurons, performed causal tests by deactivating neurons, proposed Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS) method, and conducted layer-wise analysis across three VLMs and 25 cultural groups.

Result: Found neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about corresponding cultures while having minimal effects on others. CAS outperformed existing methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons, and these neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers.

Conclusion: The study reveals the existence and importance of culture-sensitive neurons in VLMs, providing new insights into the internal organization of multimodal representations and how they handle cultural information.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a co-design approach combining algorithmic efficiency and hardware optimization to enable resource-efficient and robust inference for both conventional and Bayesian neural networks on embedded platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern machine learning faces growing computational demands that constrain scalability on resource-limited platforms, while also needing reliable predictions under distributional shifts. Bayesian neural networks provide uncertainty quantification but add computational overhead.

Method: Joint algorithmic-hardware co-design with four main approaches: 1) Galen - automatic layer-specific compression with sensitivity analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback; 2) Modeling analog accelerator imperfections and extending noisy training; 3) Developing efficient probabilistic inference approximations; 4) Probabilistic photonic computing using analog noise as entropy source.

Result: The studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, enabling faster and more energy-efficient probabilistic inference while maintaining robustness.

Conclusion: Algorithm-hardware co-design provides a foundation for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine learning systems by jointly optimizing computational efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

### [154] [Sequences of Logits Reveal the Low Rank Structure of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24966)
*Noah Golowich,Allen Liu,Abhishek Shetty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models exhibit low-rank structure in their logit matrices, enabling generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models at a model-agnostic level by treating them as sequential probabilistic models.

Method: Empirical demonstration of low-rank structure in logit matrices across various language models, and theoretical analysis of approximate rank as a universal abstraction.

Result: Low-rank structure can be leveraged for generation - responses to target prompts can be generated using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated or nonsensical prompts.

Conclusion: Language models possess fundamental low-rank structure that enables efficient generation and has provable learning guarantees through the proposed universal abstraction.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

*Mia Adler,Carrie Liang,Brian Peng,Oleg Presnyakov,Justin M. Baker,Jannelle Lauffer,Himani Sharma,Barry Merriman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rank-conditioned committee framework for MLDE that separates conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty using ranked conformations and improves SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLDE pipelines struggle to separate conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty, limiting their effectiveness in antibody fitness landscape navigation.

Method: Introduces a rank-conditioned committee framework that assigns deep neural network committees per conformation rank to enable principled separation of uncertainties.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements over baseline strategies in SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking validation.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable route for therapeutic antibody discovery while directly addressing conformational uncertainty modeling challenges.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

*Chi Zhao,Jing Liu,Elena Parilina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An end-to-end feature selection framework using game theory to identify important features while eliminating redundant ones, reducing computational costs without sacrificing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exponential data growth increases computational costs in ML training, with many features not contributing to performance but consuming substantial resources.

Method: Formulates feature selection as a cooperative game where features are players, evaluating synergistic interactions and marginal contributions through four components: sample selection, game-theoretic importance evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.

Result: Achieves substantial computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, offering an efficient solution for large-scale ML computational challenges.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic feature selection framework provides an effective approach to reduce computational costs in machine learning while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

### [157] [LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983)
*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion introduces risk-aware sampling for diffusion policies in offline RL using sequential hypothesis testing with calibrated Type-I error control, improving return-OOD trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion policies lack statistical risk control and use heuristic guidance methods that don't provide interpretable risk budgets.

Method: Uses log-likelihood ratio tests at each denoising step, gating conditional means with a logistic controller calibrated to user-specified Type-I error level alpha. Training remains vanilla DDPM with two heads.

Result: Improves return-OOD trade-off on D4RL MuJoCo tasks over Q-guided baselines while maintaining desired alpha levels. Theoretically provides level-alpha calibration and stability bounds.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

### [158] [Epileptic Seizure Detection and Prediction from EEG Data: A Machine Learning Approach with Clinical Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24986)
*Ria Jayanti,Tanish Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning approach for both seizure detection and prediction using EEG data, achieving 90.9% detection accuracy with Logistic Regression and 89.26% prediction accuracy with LSTM networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional seizure detection approaches only identify seizures after they begin, limiting opportunities for early intervention. The study aims to develop a more proactive approach that can predict seizures before they occur.

Method: Used CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database with 969 hours of recordings from 23 patients. For detection: implemented K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. For prediction: employed LSTM networks to model temporal dependencies in EEG data.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall. Random Forest and SVM achieved 94.0% accuracy but 0% recall. LSTM model achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for developing accessible real-time monitoring tools that can both detect and predict seizures, enabling a shift from reactive to proactive seizure management.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

### [159] [Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988)
*Hemanath Arumugam,Falong Fan,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel HRL architecture that integrates self-supervised Transformer-based Change Point Detection into the Option-Critic framework to autonomously discover meaningful subgoals and learn optimal option termination boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical HRL implementation suffers from challenges in autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries, despite its theoretical appeal for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Integrates a self-supervised Transformer-based CPD module into Option-Critic framework, using heuristic pseudo-labels from intrinsic signals to detect latent shifts in environment dynamics. Uses change-points to stabilize termination functions, pretrain intra-option policies via behavioral cloning, and enforce specialization through inter-option divergence penalties.

Result: Experiments on Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks show CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments, enabling autonomous discovery of reusable, semantically meaningful skills.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

### [160] [What Really Matters in Matrix-Whitening Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25000)
*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matrix-whitening optimizers outperform elementwise methods like Adam, with variance adaptation being the key overlooked factor rather than just spectral normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze matrix-whitening optimizers and identify the key components that explain their superior performance over elementwise counterparts.

Method: Systematic deconstruction of matrix-whitening optimizers through experiments comparing various flavors, analyzing spectral descent accuracy, and testing variance adaptation strategies.

Result: All matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform Adam, with variance adaptation being the crucial factor rather than spectral normalization alone. Low-rank variance estimators effectively reduce memory costs without performance loss.

Conclusion: Variance adaptation is the overlooked but essential component in matrix-whitening optimizers that explains their performance gap over elementwise methods, with low-rank approximations offering memory-efficient solutions.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Result: Outperforms classical probabilistic models on synthetic benchmarks with nonlinear distortions and temporal misalignments. Applied to DBS recordings, shows shared latents reliably encode stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.

Conclusion: SPIRE establishes as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation, revealing how external perturbations reorganize cross-regional structure.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE

robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external

TL;DR: FedLap is a novel federated learning framework for graph-structured data that uses Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches for interconnected subgraphs either compromise privacy by exchanging sensitive node embeddings or suffer from computational inefficiency that limits scalability.

Method: FedLap leverages global structure information through Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to effectively capture inter-node dependencies across distributed clients.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FedLap is the first subgraph federated learning scheme with strong privacy guarantees that effectively addresses both privacy concerns and scalability issues in graph-structured data distributed across multiple clients.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radiomics ML models are vulnerable to distribution shifts from imaging protocol variations. This study evaluates robustness across MRI sequences using phantom data, showing protocol-invariant features maintain performance while standard features degrade by 40%. Dataset augmentation improves uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation.

Method: Used a phantom of 16 fruits to evaluate distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. Compared XGBoost classifiers trained on 8 consistent robust features versus sequence-specific features. Tested protocol variations, segmentation variations, and inter-observer variability.

Result: Models trained on protocol-invariant features maintained F1-scores >0.85 across distribution shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation. Dataset augmentation reduced expected calibration error by 35% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world protocol variations.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

*Zhufeng Li,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new graph distance measure for causal discovery evaluation that focuses on how graph differences affect cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating causal discovery graphs are inadequate, especially under latent confounding, making it difficult to assess progress in the field.

Method: Uses identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome pairs in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs).

Result: The measure's behavior is analyzed under different graph perturbations and compared against existing distance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed distance measure provides a more meaningful evaluation framework for causal discovery methods by focusing on practical causal inference tasks rather than just structural differences.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DWMGrad is a novel optimization algorithm that uses dynamic guidance based on historical data to adaptively update momentum and learning rates, addressing limitations of SGD and Adam in handling complex models and non-convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam struggle with learning efficiency fluctuations, complex model demands, and non-convex optimization issues due to limitations in handling complex data structures, learning rate selection, local optima avoidance, and high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Built on traditional methods, DWMGrad incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism that uses historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates, allowing flexible adjustment of reliance on historical information to adapt to various training scenarios.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows DWMGrad achieves faster convergence rates and higher accuracies across multiple scenarios compared to traditional optimization methods.

Conclusion: DWMGrad's dynamic guidance mechanism enables better adaptation to changing environments and task complexities, making it a more effective optimization algorithm for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Motivation: To enable exploration of trainable architectures that integrate black-box functions, especially when computational graphs are inaccessible, and to leverage fixed modules to expand model capacity.

Method: Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND) - a perturbative method for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible computational graphs.

Result: BOND shows improved accuracy and scalability over existing perturbative methods. Black-box functions (fixed, untrained networks) enhance model performance without increasing trainable parameters, without requiring extensive optimization.

Conclusion: Fixed, non-trainable modules can expand model capacity, suggesting potential for combining analogue and digital devices as a scaling mechanism for networks.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable

architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

TL;DR: PESO is a continual learning method for LLM-based recommendation that uses proximal regularization to balance adaptation to new user preferences while avoiding overfitting to outdated historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based continual learning methods focus on preserving past performance, but in recommendation systems, predicting outdated preferences can harm performance when user interests shift significantly over time.

Method: Proposes PESO (Proximally rEgularized Single evolving lOra) which introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling flexible balance between adaptation and preservation.

Result: PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The proximal regularization approach provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace and effectively addresses the unique challenges of continual learning in recommendation systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

TL;DR: FairMIB is a multi-view information bottleneck framework that decomposes graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views to mitigate complexity biases in GNNs, achieving superior fairness-utility trade-offs.


<details>

Motivation: GNNs can amplify training data biases, propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes. Existing fairness methods often treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects.

Method: Uses contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning, integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives, and introduces inverse probability-weighted adjacency correction in the diffusion view.

Result: Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: FairMIB effectively addresses multiple sources of bias in GNNs through its multi-view decomposition approach and achieves optimal fairness-utility balance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

### [169] [Shift is Good: Mismatched Data Mixing Improves Test Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25108)
*Marko Medvedev,Kaifeng Lyu,Zhiyuan Li,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distribution shift between training and test mixtures can be beneficial, improving test performance even without transfer between components. The paper identifies optimal training proportions and analyzes benefits in various scenarios including compositional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional view that distribution shift between training and test data is always detrimental, and to systematically analyze when and how mismatched training proportions can actually improve test performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of mixture distributions with different training and test proportions, examining scenarios where components are unrelated with no transfer between them. The analysis extends to compositional settings with different distributions of component 'skills' at training and test time.

Result: Distribution shift can be beneficial generically in many settings, and test performance can improve due to mismatched training proportions. The paper identifies optimal training proportions and quantifies the extent of potential benefits from such distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Distribution shift between training and test data is not necessarily harmful and can be systematically leveraged to improve performance, with identifiable optimal training strategies that differ from test distributions.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) is a novel neural network architecture that incorporates geometric structure by modeling networks as differentiable manifolds with Riemannian metrics, enabling geometric regularization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional Euclidean parameter spaces and incorporate explicit geometric structure into neural networks, providing intrinsic regularization, enhanced generalization, and geometric interpretability.

Method: Three-layer architecture: Coordinate Layer (smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations), Geometric Layer (dynamic metric generation via sub-networks), and Evolution Layer (dual-objective optimization combining task performance and geometric simplicity).

Result: The framework enables natural gradient descent aligned with learned manifold geometry, provides geometric regularization that penalizes excessive curvature and volume distortion, and offers unprecedented interpretability through geometric meaning in representations.

Conclusion: NDM represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems with potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

### [171] [A Unified Bilevel Model for Adversarial Learning and A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25121)
*Yutong Zheng,Qingna Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified bilevel model for adversarial learning is proposed, with focus on interpreting adversarial attacks in clustering models from a data perturbation perspective. The paper analyzes the robustness of clustering models and introduces a δ-measure to quantify attack effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanism of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted due to complex ML model structures, and there's unclear understanding of how to measure attack effects, particularly in clustering models.

Method: Propose a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and investigate adversarial attacks in clustering models from data perturbation perspective. Analyze the δ-measure for quantifying attack effects.

Result: Revealed that clustering models are robust to small data perturbations but vulnerable to larger perturbations that change clustering results. Established the well-definedness of δ-measure for measuring attack effects.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel model and δ-measure provide a framework for understanding and quantifying adversarial attacks in clustering, addressing the interpretation gap in adversarial learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

*Woojin Cho,Kookjin Lee,Noseong Park,Donsub Rim,Gerrit Welper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven dimensionality reduction method using low rank neural representation (LRNR) for hyperbolic wave propagation that learns efficient low-dimensional representations directly from data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for physics-based hyperbolic wave propagation data, motivated by theoretical results proving the existence of such representations.

Method: Uses specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation (LRNR) within a hypernetwork framework, combining deep learning techniques to learn from data.

Result: Learns efficient low-dimensional representations of propagating waves, discovers natural low rank tensor representations that reveal interpretable physical features, and enables efficient inference via compression.

Conclusion: LRNR architecture successfully creates interpretable, efficient representations for wave propagation with practical benefits for performance-demanding applications.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

*Yuen Chen,Yulun Wu,Samuel Sharpe,Igor Melnyk,Nam H. Nguyen,Furong Huang,C. Bayan Bruss,Rizal Fathony*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a unified architecture that jointly models sequential and relational data by coupling sequence encoders with GNNs, enabling token-level message passing between neighboring sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain both sequential events and relational interactions, but existing methods typically handle only one modality, missing the complementary nature of sequences and graphs.

Method: BRIDGE combines sequence encoder with GNN under single objective, with TOKENXATTN layer for token-level cross-attention message passing between events in neighboring sequences.

Result: Outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph methods, and sequence-only baselines on friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud detection (Amazon) tasks.

Conclusion: Sequences and graphs should be learned jointly as complementary facets, and BRIDGE provides an effective unified approach for such datasets.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

### [174] [An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128)
*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that connects data augmentation with causal inference, showing how DA can be used as interventions to reduce bias from hidden confounders and improve generalization across interventions, introducing IV-like regression for when instrumental variables are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend data augmentation beyond i.i.d. settings for causal generalization across interventions, addressing the limitation that instrumental variables may not be readily available in many applications.

Method: Proposes a unifying framework linking DA to causal inference, introduces IV-like regression that relaxes IV properties, and shows how parameterized DA can be cast as an IVL regression problem to simulate worst-case DA scenarios.

Result: Theoretical analysis for population case and simulation experiments show improved performance on causal estimation and generalization tasks beyond simple DA, with real data experiments supporting the findings.

Conclusion: Data augmentation can effectively serve as interventions to mitigate confounding bias and improve generalization across interventions when appropriately framed within causal inference, especially when instrumental variables are unavailable.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

### [175] [Lipschitz-aware Linearity Grafting for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25130)
*Yongjin Han,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linearity grafting into non-linear activation functions reduces approximation errors and tightens local Lipschitz constants, improving certified robustness without requiring certified training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network verification methods suffer from approximation errors that prevent obtaining tight local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness against adversarial examples.

Method: Proposed Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that grafts linearity into non-linear activation functions to eliminate approximation errors, since linear functions don't require relaxation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that grafting linearity into influential activations tightens the l∞ local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting improves certified robustness by reducing approximation errors and providing tighter local Lipschitz constants, offering theoretical justification for this approach.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

TL;DR: ML-guided framework for Optimal Power Shutoff problems that quickly produces high-quality de-energization decisions by exploiting shared patterns across instances and integrating domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rapidly solve computationally challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs for wildfire risk management through power line de-energization, leveraging the common structure across OPS instances with varying parameters.

Method: Extends existing ML-guided MILP solution methods by integrating domain knowledge about the number of energized and de-energized lines, exploiting shared patterns across OPS instances.

Result: The proposed ML-guided method produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods on a large-scale realistic California-based synthetic test system.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively accelerate the solution of Optimal Power Shutoff problems for wildfire risk management while maintaining solution quality.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a co-optimization framework for distributed machine learning that simultaneously optimizes CPU resource allocation and local model training across computing nodes, achieving over 50% improvement in cost optimality gap compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable AI solutions requires optimization of computing resources for distributed ML and optimization problems.

Method: A co-optimization setup that assigns CPU usage while training nodes locally with their data shares, using time-varying but balanced information-sharing networks to ensure consensus convergence. The algorithm is all-time feasible and supports log-scale quantization over communication channels.

Result: The proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than 50% compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions. Convergence is proven using perturbation theory, Lyapunov stability, and eigen-spectrum analysis.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses distributed ML optimization with resource constraints, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining feasibility and supporting quantized communication.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

### [178] [Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207)
*Yisong Fu,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yujie Li,Zhulin An,Qi Wang,Yongjun Xu,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective learning strategy for deep time series forecasting that filters out uncertain and anomalous timesteps during training to prevent overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting suffer from overfitting due to noise and anomalies in time series data, as current methods uniformly optimize all timesteps without distinguishing between generalizable and non-generalizable ones.

Method: A dual-mask mechanism with (1) uncertainty mask using residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and (2) anomaly mask using residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. This allows selective calculation of MSE loss only on screened timesteps.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show significant improvements: 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Conclusion: Selective learning effectively prevents overfitting in deep time series forecasting by focusing model optimization on generalizable timesteps while ignoring uncertain and anomalous ones.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-sensitive multi-class PU learning method using adaptive loss weighting to achieve unbiased risk estimation for positive-unlabeled data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-class PU learning remains challenging as many existing approaches lack unbiased risk estimation, limiting performance and stability in real applications where annotating reliable negatives is difficult or costly.

Method: Proposed a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method based on adaptive loss weighting within empirical risk minimization framework, assigning distinct data-dependent weights to positive and inferred-negative loss components.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes show consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides unbiased risk estimation for multi-class PU learning, achieving improved performance and stability across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA is a plug-and-play framework that accelerates deep learning training by differentially scaling updates in Dom-space (top eigendirections) and Bulk-space (orthogonal component), achieving ~2x speedup on LLaMA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dichotomy where parameter updates along top Hessian eigendirections (Dom-space) have large magnitude but minimal loss reduction, while smaller updates in Bulk-space drive most learning progress.

Method: Introduces BSFA framework with efficient PCA-based estimator on historical updates for subspace estimation and block-wise strategy for scalability, differentially scaling updates in Dom-space and Bulk-space.

Result: Achieves approximately 2x speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Conclusion: BSFA provides a practical and scalable solution to accelerate training by leveraging the distinct roles of Dom-space and Bulk-space updates, with efficient subspace estimation making it suitable for large models.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Conclusion: BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training, providing better stability and performance compared to standard WGAN.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

TL;DR: Efficient techniques for Bayesian network structure sampling: optimized basic moves and parent set pruning for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian network structure inference via MCMC sampling is computationally expensive, requiring improvements to basic operations and parent set calculations.

Method: Two techniques: 1) Efficient implementation of basic moves (add/delete/reverse arcs), 2) Preprocessing method to prune possible parent sets while preserving sums.

Result: Empirical study shows substantial efficiency gains compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve sampling efficiency for Bayesian network structure inference.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

*Xiandong Zou,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBNorm is a new normalization method based on Information Bottleneck principle that outperforms traditional variance-centric methods like BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across both language and vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods focus only on stabilizing training through variance control without directly optimizing how representations capture task-relevant information.

Method: IBNorm introduces bounded compression operations that preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability, grounded in Information Bottleneck principle.

Result: IBNorm consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior.

Conclusion: IBNorm provides a more informative normalization approach that achieves higher IB value and tighter generalization bounds while maintaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization methods.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm

*Blaise Delattre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis addresses neural network instability through sensitivity analysis, combining Lipschitz networks for input perturbation robustness, curvature regularization for smooth optimization landscapes, and randomized smoothing for decision boundary robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer from instability and vulnerability where small input changes drastically affect predictions, and optimization is hindered by sharp loss landscapes.

Method: Uses Lipschitz networks to constrain input sensitivity, introduces curvature-based regularization for parameter sensitivity, and applies randomized smoothing for probabilistic robustness at decision boundaries.

Result: Develops a unified framework combining Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization with contributions including efficient spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved certification procedures.

Conclusion: The sensitivity analysis perspective provides a comprehensive approach to address fundamental stability challenges in neural networks through theoretical analysis and practical methodologies.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework for spatiotemporal dynamics that combines data-driven learning with physical knowledge integration, enabling both forward prediction and inverse discovery of PDEs from sparse noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems is challenging due to intractable PDEs with high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities. Existing methods lack physical consistency or structural capacity to handle complex operators.

Method: Two-level architecture: first level learns fundamental symbolic PDE components, second level learns their governing combinations. Uses adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to capture non-local dependencies and high-order operators. Embeds known physical laws into computational graph.

Result: Framework enables physical consistency, improved data efficiency, and interpretable discovery of governing equations through symbolic regression without presupposing functional forms.

Conclusion: The hierarchical decomposition reduces learning complexity while enabling structural integration of prior knowledge, advancing both forward prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws from limited data.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

### [186] [Dense and Diverse Goal Coverage in Multi Goal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25311)
*Sagalpreet Singh,Rishi Saket,Aravindan Raghuveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel RL algorithm that learns policies maximizing expected return while ensuring uniform visitation of goal states, addressing the limitation of existing methods that may exploit few reward sources without dispersing state distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL focuses on maximizing expected return, leading to policies that exploit few reward sources. Many natural scenarios require dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states while maintaining high returns, which remains unexplored. Existing entropy regularization and intrinsic reward methods encourage exploration but don't guarantee dispersed goal state visitation.

Method: Proposes a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with dispersed marginal state distribution over goal states. Uses a custom RL reward computed based on current policy mixture at each iteration for sampled trajectories, then applies offline RL to update the policy mixture. Assumes an oracle classifier determines goal states.

Result: The algorithm provides performance guarantees with efficient convergence bounds for optimizing an objective that captures both expected return and dispersion of marginal state distribution over goal states. Experiments conducted on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the multi-goal RL problem by learning policies that maximize return while ensuring uniform visitation of goal states, overcoming limitations of existing approaches that either don't guarantee dispersion or require apriori target distributions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

*Xuchen Feng,Siyu Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel invertible linear layer using circulant-diagonal matrix products for normalizing flows, reducing parameter complexity from O(n²) to O(mn) and computational costs via FFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design efficient linear layers for normalizing flows that maintain expressiveness while enabling fast computation of Jacobian determinants and inverses.

Method: Introduces circulant-diagonal matrix decomposition with m diagonal and m-1 circulant matrices, leveraging FFT for efficient O(mn log n) inversion and O(mn) log-determinant computation.

Result: CDFlow achieves strong density estimation on natural images, effectively models periodic data, and significantly accelerates normalizing flow operations.

Conclusion: The circulant-diagonal approach provides an efficient and expressive linear layer for normalizing flows, enabling scalable generative modeling with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

### [188] [Beyond Leakage and Complexity: Towards Realistic and Efficient Information Cascade Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25348)
*Jie Peng,Rui Wang,Qiang Wang,Zhewei Wei,Bin Tong,Guan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses three limitations in information cascade prediction: temporal leakage in evaluation, feature-poor datasets, and computational inefficiency. It proposes time-ordered data splitting, a new e-commerce dataset with purchase conversions, and a lightweight CasTemp framework that achieves SOTA performance with significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cascade prediction methods suffer from temporal leakage (models accessing future information), lack downstream conversion signals in datasets, and are computationally inefficient with complex graph methods requiring days of training for marginal gains.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Time-ordered splitting strategy for leak-free evaluation, (2) Taoke dataset with rich e-commerce attributes and purchase conversions, (3) CasTemp framework using temporal walks, Jaccard-based neighbor selection, and GRU encoding with time-aware attention.

Result: CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with orders-of-magnitude speedup under leak-free evaluation. It particularly excels at predicting second-stage popularity conversions, which is critical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed time-ordered evaluation, rich dataset, and efficient CasTemp framework systematically address key limitations in cascade prediction, enabling more realistic and practical applications with superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical analysis of hypergraph learning convergence to p-Laplacian equations and proposes HOHL method with multiscale smoothness regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypergraphs model higher-order interactions but lack theoretical foundations in semi-supervised learning; existing methods have limited theoretical guarantees.

Method: Proposes Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) that regularizes via powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness.

Result: HOHL converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm and performs strongly on standard baselines empirically.

Conclusion: The work establishes theoretical foundations for hypergraph learning and demonstrates practical effectiveness of the proposed HOHL approach.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

*Rupesh Sapkota,Caglar Demir,Arnab Sharma,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using weighted averaging for model merging in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models instead of traditional ensemble methods, showing improved performance with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods for KGE models require training multiple models, which increases computational overhead, latency, and memory usage. Model merging approaches offer a more efficient alternative.

Method: Two weighted averaging approaches: 1) maintaining a running average of model parameters from training epochs, and 2) selectively updating the running average only when validation performance improves. Evaluated on link prediction, literal-augmented KGE models, and multi-hop query answering.

Result: The proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improved performance across diverse evaluation settings compared to state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: Weighted averaging for model merging is an effective and efficient alternative to traditional ensemble methods in KGE models, providing better performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a two-phase optimization algorithm that switches between Adam and Conjugate Gradient methods based on detecting when loss functions transition from non-convex to convex regions near optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss functions often have non-convex regions but become convex near local minima, suggesting hybrid optimization could leverage both non-convex and convex methods for better performance.

Method: Detects transition from non-convex to convex regions by observing gradient norm dependence on loss, then switches from Adam (non-convex phase) to Conjugate Gradient (convex phase).

Result: Experimental results confirm the hypothesis and show substantial improvements in convergence and accuracy by exploiting this convexity structure.

Conclusion: The simple convexity structure in loss functions is frequent enough to be practically exploited for improved optimization performance through hybrid algorithms.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt PIML's success in physics to biology, which has different constraints including multi-faceted prior knowledge, heterogeneous data, partial observability, and high-dimensional networks.

Method: BIML extends PIML by retooling methods to operate under softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge with four foundational pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.

Result: A principled framework that retains PIML's structural grounding while adapting to biological realities, using Foundation Models and Large Language Models as key enablers.

Conclusion: BIML provides a roadmap to channel PIML-inspired innovation toward high-impact biological challenges, with concrete recommendations for ecosystem building.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

*Adrien Weihs,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies neural operator learning for multiple operators, distinguishing between learning a continuum of operators parameterized by functions versus learning several distinct operators. It introduces new architectures with universal approximation guarantees and scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific applications require approximating mappings between function spaces (operators), but most ML focuses on finite-dimensional mappings. There's a need for scalable neural operator learning methods that can handle multiple operators efficiently.

Method: Introduced two new architectures: MNO and MONet for multiple operator learning. For learning several distinct operators, developed a framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks. Provided theoretical analysis including universal approximation results and scaling laws.

Result: Established universal approximation results in three settings (continuous, integrable, Lipschitz operators) and derived explicit scaling laws for Lipschitz operators. Empirical experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirmed strong expressive power and efficiency of proposed architectures.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator learning across multiple operators, with architectures that achieve strong performance on scientific applications.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian Optimization methods require careful parameter tuning for each application domain, while current LLMs lack capabilities for continuous black-box optimization tasks. There's a need to combine the sample efficiency of classical methods with the generalization capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Fine-tune large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, leveraging LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks.

Result: GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers on various black-box optimization benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in global optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The method highlights the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introduces a flexible framework for global optimization that eliminates the need for parameter tuning.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

TL;DR: Proposes utility calibration framework for scalable multiclass calibration evaluation using user-specific utility functions to unify and improve existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiclass calibration methods focus on specific prediction aspects or use computationally intensive variational approaches, lacking scalable evaluation frameworks that align with end-user decision criteria.

Method: Introduces utility calibration framework that measures calibration error relative to specific utility functions representing end-user goals and decision criteria.

Result: Shows how utility calibration can unify existing metrics (top-class, class-wise) and enable more robust versions, while extending to richer downstream utility classes.

Conclusion: Utility calibration provides a scalable, general framework for multiclass calibration evaluation that better aligns with practical user needs and decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust validation metrics that can detect overfitting, monitor training dynamics, and attribute performance to individual training samples in supervised classification, without requiring a separate validation set.

Method: Introduces Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA) which quantifies the coherence between per-sample gradients and model weights during training. GWA is efficiently computable and captures both sample-specific contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments show that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping points, enables principled model comparisons, identifies influential training samples, and reflects generalization performance - all without needing a validation set.

Conclusion: GWA provides an effective validation-set-free approach for model analysis that tracks generalization during training and attributes performance to individual samples, offering insights directly from training data.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training

TL;DR: The paper introduces prototypical neurosymbolic architectures to prevent reasoning shortcuts in neurosymbolic AI by ensuring models learn correct concepts rather than exploiting spurious correlations, even with very limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI models are prone to shortcut reasoning where they learn unintended concepts that exploit spurious correlations to satisfy symbolic constraints, compromising reliability.

Method: Proposed prototypical neurosymbolic architectures that train models to satisfy symbolic constraints while considering input similarity to labeled prototypes, leveraging prototypical learning theory.

Result: Significant improvements in learning correct concepts across synthetic tasks (MNIST-EvenOdd, Kand-Logic) and real-world high-stakes tasks (BDD-OIA), especially in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Prototype grounding is an effective and annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning that prevents reasoning shortcuts at their root cause.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast
majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than
existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,
providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning approach using SVM achieved best performance (R2=0.84) for predicting employee burnout risk, with an interactive interface for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burnout significantly impacts individual well-being and organizational performance, requiring early detection methods.

Method: Evaluated three supervised algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) on HackerEarth dataset using 30-fold cross-validation with R2 metric.

Result: SVM performed best (R2=0.84) and was statistically superior to other models; interactive Streamlit interface developed for practical use.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows potential for early burnout detection and data-driven mental health strategies in organizations.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

### [200] [FaCT: Faithful Concept Traces for Explaining Neural Network Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25512)
*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations that are faithful, shared across classes, and can be traced from any layer to the logit and input-visualization, while introducing a new concept-consistency metric called C²-Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc concept-based explanation methods are not always faithful to the model and make restrictive assumptions about concepts (class-specificity, small spatial extent, alignment to human expectations), limiting their effectiveness for understanding deep networks.

Method: Proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations where concepts are shared across classes and their contribution to logits and input-visualization can be faithfully traced from any layer. Also introduces C²-Score metric using foundation models to evaluate concept consistency.

Result: The proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent than prior work, users find them more interpretable, and the model retains competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The approach provides more faithful and interpretable concept-based explanations while maintaining model performance, addressing limitations of existing post-hoc methods through model-inherent mechanistic explanations.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

### [201] [Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25542)
*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel information-theoretic objective (KG-MI) for training multi-head transformers to provably recover underlying DAG structures from data, extending beyond previous tree-like graph guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical understanding of transformer training dynamics is limited to tree-like graphs with single parent dependencies. Extending provable guarantees to general DAGs with multiple parents per node remains challenging due to difficulty in designing training objectives that enable attention heads to learn multiple parent relationships separately.

Method: Proposes kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) based on f-divergence, combined with multi-head attention framework where each head uses distinct marginal transition kernels to model diverse parent-child dependencies. Uses gradient ascent training of single-layer multi-head transformers.

Result: Proves that training converges to global optimum in polynomial time for K-parent DAGs. Characterizes attention score patterns at convergence. When using KL divergence, learned attention scores accurately reflect ground-truth adjacency matrix, provably recovering underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed KG-MI objective enables provable recovery of general DAG structures using multi-head transformers, overcoming previous limitations to tree-like graphs and providing theoretical guarantees for graph structure learning.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

### [202] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25557)
*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) with a quantum recurrent core as a parametrized quantum circuit, achieving competitive performance on various sequence-learning tasks against classical baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a physically consistent RNN that leverages quantum advantages - using unitary recurrence for high-capacity memory in exponentially large Hilbert spaces, while incorporating classical nonlinearity through mid-circuit measurements and feedforward control.

Method: The QRNN uses a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) as the recurrent core, with hidden states as quantum states in C^2^n. Mid-circuit measurements provide readouts combined with input embeddings, processed by a classical feedforward network that parametrizes the PQC for unitary state updates.

Result: The model achieved competitive performance on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, language modeling, and machine translation tasks with up to 14 qubits, outperforming classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Conclusion: This is the first quantum-grounded model to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across diverse sequence-learning tasks, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for practical machine learning applications.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

*Víctor Medina,Giovanny A. Cuervo-Londoño,Javier Sánchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adapted Aurora deep learning model from atmospheric to ocean forecasting for sea surface temperature prediction in the Canary Upwelling System, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical ocean forecasting models have high computational costs and scalability limitations, while deep learning offers potential for more efficient prediction of oceanographic variables crucial for climate change understanding and marine resource management.

Method: Fine-tuned Aurora foundational deep learning model using high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, employing staged fine-tuning process with latitude-weighted error metrics and hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Achieved low RMSE of 0.119K and high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC ≈ 0.997), successfully reproducing large-scale SST structures but struggling with finer coastal details.

Conclusion: Demonstrated feasibility of adapting pre-trained deep learning models from different domains for ocean forecasting, with future improvements including additional variables, higher resolution, and physics-informed neural networks for better interpretability.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

### [204] [A Framework for Bounding Deterministic Risk with PAC-Bayes: Applications to Majority Votes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25569)
*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework to extract deterministic hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian bounds, enabling practical deployment of single classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PAC-Bayes only provides guarantees for randomly sampled hypotheses, requiring stochastic predictions at test time, which is impractical for real-world applications that need deterministic classifiers.

Method: Proposed a general oracle bound framework that extracts single hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian bounds, including numerical bounds and specialization to majority vote classifiers.

Result: Empirical results show the approach consistently outperforms popular baselines by up to a factor of 2 for generalization bounds on deterministic classifiers.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between stochastic PAC-Bayesian theory and practical deterministic classifier deployment, providing significantly improved generalization guarantees.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

### [205] [Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Inverse Approximations under Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25571)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the spectral-norm robustness of low-rank pseudoinverse approximations under noise, deriving sharp perturbation bounds that improve over classical approaches by up to √n factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, but their robustness to noise (from sampling, sketching, quantization) remains poorly understood, requiring systematic analysis of perturbation errors.

Method: The study uses contour integral techniques applied to the non-entire function f(z)=1/z to derive non-asymptotic perturbation bounds that account for eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions.

Result: The derived bounds closely track true perturbation error across real-world and synthetic matrices, improving over classical full-inverse bounds by up to √n factor, while classical estimates tend to significantly overpredict errors.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational environments, offering improved error bounds for real-world applications.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of Sobolev IPM using Orlicz geometric structure to overcome limitations of L^p geometry, and introduces Musielak regularization to achieve computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of Sobolev IPM being intrinsically bound to L^p geometric structure, which restricts its ability to incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the L^p geometry paradigm.

Method: Generalize Sobolev IPM through Orlicz geometric structure, establish connection between Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm for regularization, and exploit graph structure to reduce the problem to univariate optimization.

Result: GSI-M achieves several-order faster computation than popular Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and demonstrates practical advantages in document classification and topological data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GSI-M framework successfully generalizes Sobolev IPM beyond L^p geometry while achieving remarkable computational efficiency through Musielak regularization and graph structure exploitation.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A structured local learning framework using SVD decomposition to train DNNs on low-rank manifolds, achieving BP-comparable accuracy with fewer parameters and local updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP has high memory/computational overhead due to global error propagation, while DFA has poor scalability in deep architectures. Need for efficient local learning that maintains accuracy.

Method: Train layers in SVD-decomposed form with composite loss (cross-entropy, subspace alignment, orthogonality regularization). Construct structured feedback matrices matching SVD structure for consistent alignment.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to BP on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with reduced trainable parameters. Ablation studies confirm importance of each loss term.

Conclusion: Local learning on low-rank manifolds is a principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

*Christopher Bülte,Yusuf Sale,Gitta Kutyniok,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a family of uncertainty measures for regression tasks based on proper scoring rules, particularly kernel scores, to address the gap in uncertainty quantification literature that has been largely focused on classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks in safety-critical domains require proper uncertainty quantification, but existing literature remains largely classification-focused, creating a need for regression-specific uncertainty measures.

Method: Developed a framework using proper scoring rules with emphasis on kernel scores to create measures for total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty. The framework unifies existing measures and provides guidelines for designing new ones based on kernel choice.

Result: The measures are effective in downstream tasks and reveal clear trade-offs among different instantiations, including robustness and out-of-distribution detection performance. Explicit correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior were proven.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel-based framework provides a principled approach for designing task-specific uncertainty measures in regression, with demonstrated effectiveness and clear understanding of trade-offs between different measure properties.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares FP and INT quantization formats, revealing that while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, fine-grained INT formats (especially MXINT8) offer superior accuracy and hardware efficiency for 8-bit quantization, challenging the industry trend toward FP-only hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide clear guidance for algorithm and hardware co-design by conducting a unified comparison of FP and INT quantization across varying granularities, as current industry trends favor FP formats without comprehensive analysis of trade-offs.

Method: The authors systematically investigate trade-offs between FP and INT formats across different granularities, introduce a symmetric clipping method to resolve gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, and apply outlier-mitigation techniques like Hadamard rotation.

Result: For 8-bit fine-grained formats, MXINT8 outperforms FP counterparts in both accuracy and hardware efficiency. For 4-bit formats, FP often has accuracy advantages, but NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 with outlier-mitigation techniques. The symmetric clipping method enables nearly lossless MXINT8 training.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the current hardware trajectory toward FP-only approaches, demonstrating that fine-grained INT formats (particularly MXINT8) offer better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI accelerators, advocating against a one-size-fits-all FP approach.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

*Nikita Kachaev,Mikhail Kolosov,Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models suffer from visual representation degradation during action fine-tuning, but a simple alignment method can mitigate this and improve out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how action fine-tuning affects the original vision-language representations in VLA models and find ways to preserve VL capabilities while enabling action learning.

Method: Systematic study using probing of hidden representations, attention map analysis, and targeted tasks to compare VLA models with their VLM counterparts. Introduced visual representation alignment strategies.

Result: Naive action fine-tuning degrades visual representations, but the proposed alignment method successfully mitigates degradation and improves OOD generalization.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between action fine-tuning and VL representation preservation, but practical approaches can recover inherited VL capabilities while maintaining action performance.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that improve classical results, with applications to differentially private PCA and up to √n factor improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how noise affects low-rank approximations in spectral norm is crucial for differentially private methods, as spectral norm captures worst-case directional error and provides strongest utility guarantees.

Method: Novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis extended to spectral functionals, establishing high-probability bounds that explicitly capture interactions between matrix A and perturbation E.

Result: Sharp estimates for ||(A+E)_p - A_p|| under mild eigengap and norm conditions, with improvements up to factor √n. Improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA.

Conclusion: The bounds closely track actual spectral error in real-world datasets and resolve an open problem in differentially private PCA literature.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

Motivation: To understand how RNNs can generate rich, spontaneous, and stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings, which contrasts with traditional RNN applications focused on simple, deterministic behaviors.

Method: Train RNNs to replicate HMM emission statistics, then reverse-engineer the trained networks to uncover the mechanisms they implement, analyzing across multiple HMM architectures (fully connected, cyclic, linear-chain).

Result: Trained RNNs develop noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits, with transitions governed by regions of slow noise-driven dynamics connected by fast deterministic transitions, facilitated by a small set of 'kick neurons' and stochastic resonance.

Conclusion: RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent dynamics through a compositional principle involving modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, enabling probabilistic computations.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

*Alessandro Lucchetti,Francesco Cadini,Marco Giglio,Luca Lomazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSS is a Graph Neural Network framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, featuring local frame kinematics, sign-aware loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity to accurately simulate wave-dominated structural dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in applying GNNs to structural problems, particularly dynamic cases, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions for wave-dominated structural simulations.

Method: Uses encode-process-decode GNN paradigm with three key features: node kinematics in node-fixed local frames to avoid catastrophic cancellation, sign-aware regression loss to reduce phase errors, and wavelength-informed connectivity radius for optimized graph construction.

Result: GNSS accurately reproduces physics over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, achieving substantial inference speedups compared to explicit finite element baselines while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: Locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations, demonstrating successful surrogate modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

TL;DR: CS-GRU combines spiking neural networks with convolutional GRUs to better capture local dependencies in temporal and spatio-temporal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RNNs lose local details in long sequences, and existing spiking GRU approaches fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data.

Method: Introduces Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell that uses convolutional operations to preserve local structure while integrating spiking neurons' temporal precision with GRU gating mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by average 4.35%, achieves over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST, with 69% higher efficiency than SpikGRU.

Conclusion: CS-GRU provides a versatile architecture that excels on both temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, effectively preserving local dependencies while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

TL;DR: LieSolver uses Lie symmetries to enforce PDEs exactly, improving accuracy and convergence for initial-boundary value problems compared to PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and reliable method for solving PDE-constrained problems by leveraging physical laws through symmetry transformations.

Method: Uses Lie symmetries to enforce PDE exactly by construction, learning solutions from initial and boundary data while incorporating physical laws inherently.

Result: Faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for linear homogeneous PDEs with various initial conditions, with improved convergence and rigorous error estimation.

Conclusion: LieSolver improves computational efficiency and prediction reliability for PDE-constrained problems through exact PDE enforcement via symmetry transformations.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for AI and Deep Learning requires efficient data preprocessing tools that can handle multiple data formats and scale with data size, overcoming limitations of existing workflows in larger processing pipelines like Apache Airflow.

Method: Utilized SparkDataFrames for scalable data processing with a generalizable JSON input format to describe stepwise changes. Implemented 69 stages covering input/output, filtering, statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

Result: Successfully demonstrated MLPrE's capabilities with six diverse datasets, showing its ability to process multiple fields independently and recombine them, perform clustering on wine quality data, and prepare data for graph databases using phosphosite kinase data.

Conclusion: MLPrE provides a generalizable, scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis that accelerates and simplifies development in larger machine learning workflows, addressing a critical need in the expanding ML landscape.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods in medical imaging, showing they fail to capture contextual relationships between adjacent instances like patches or slices, which are crucial for accurate classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately and ignore contextual relationships between nearby patches or slices, which can be essential for accurate predictions in medical imaging applications.

Method: The authors designed a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial, and compared off-the-shelf MIL approaches against the optimal Bayes estimator (available in closed-form) to quantify their limitations.

Result: The study demonstrates that both conventional and newer correlated MIL methods struggle to generalize effectively even when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of instances, failing to match the performance of the optimal Bayes estimator.

Conclusion: Current MIL methods have significant limitations in capturing contextual relationships between instances, highlighting the need for improved approaches that can better model spatial dependencies in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) learn SDE transition laws using conditional normalizing flows, enabling efficient one-shot sampling between arbitrary time points with up to 100x speed-up compared to traditional numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SDE modeling requires costly numerical solvers for sampling between arbitrary time points, which is inefficient for noisy and irregularly sampled time series common in finance, physics, and machine learning.

Method: Introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants that directly learn SDE transition laws using conditional normalizing flows with architectural constraints preserving stochastic flow properties.

Result: NSFs achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps while maintaining distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches, as demonstrated on synthetic SDE simulations and real-world tracking/video data.

Conclusion: NSFs provide an efficient alternative to traditional numerical SDE solvers, enabling fast arbitrary time-point sampling while preserving accuracy, making them suitable for applications with irregularly sampled time series.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

*Tingting Huang,Jundong Chen,Huanqiang Zeng,Guofa Cai,Georges Kaddoum*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A deep learning-assisted power domain non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system is proposed for vehicular communications, using a DNN-based demodulator that eliminates chaotic synchronization and reference signals while improving spectral efficiency and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-user chaotic communication systems suffer from low spectral efficiency due to reference signal transmission and limited user connectivity under orthogonal multiple access. Non-orthogonal schemes face high computational complexity and inflexible scalability.

Method: A deep neural network-based demodulator is designed to learn chaotic signal characteristics offline, eliminating chaotic synchronization and reference signals. It uses dual-domain feature extraction (time and frequency domains) and is integrated into successive interference cancellation to mitigate error propagation.

Result: The system achieves superior performance in spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, bit error rate, security, and robustness, while maintaining lower computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-NOMA-CSK system demonstrates practical viability for secure vehicular communications with enhanced performance and reduced complexity.

Abstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for
vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered
considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.
However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those
based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to
reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal
multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code
multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high
computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook
designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain
non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for
vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is
designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline
training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference
signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction
architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain
information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic
channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and
extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit
error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower
computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided
schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular
communications.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Resi-VidTok is a resilient video transmission framework that uses importance-ordered tokenization for ultra-low-rate wireless video streaming, achieving robust quality at extremely low bandwidth (CBR 0.0004) with real-time 30fps performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video transmission over wireless networks remains challenging under severe channel conditions like limited bandwidth and weak connectivity, requiring solutions that maintain perceptual and semantic fidelity.

Method: Uses spatio-temporal tokenization with key and refinement tokens, progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, differential temporal token coding, stride-controlled frame sparsification with lightweight interpolation, and channel-adaptive source-channel coding.

Result: Achieves robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios as low as 0.0004 with real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps, demonstrating strong performance across adverse SNR conditions.

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok provides a practical solution for energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless video applications with graceful quality degradation under constrained channels.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

Motivation: Address critical challenges of communication overhead, data heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI) feedback in massive MIMO systems.

Method: Propose Fed-PELAD framework with personalized encoders trained locally on each UE to capture device-specific characteristics, and a shared decoder updated globally via BS coordination using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Only compact LoRA adapter parameters are transmitted. Includes alternating freezing strategy with calibrated learning-rate ratio for convergence stability.

Result: Extensive simulations on 3GPP-standard channel models show Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97% of uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while achieving 1.2 dB performance gain in CSI feedback accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: Fed-PELAD effectively addresses communication overhead, data heterogeneity, and privacy concerns in federated CSI feedback while maintaining high performance through personalized-local and shared-global architecture with LoRA adaptation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead, data
heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI)
feedback in massive MIMO systems. To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel
federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a
LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained
locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel
characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the
coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This
design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model
updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence
stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated
learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on
3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\%
of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while
achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under

Motivation: To meet requirements for diverse networks with low energy consumption by integrating sensing, computing, and communication functionalities.

Method: Uses TRIS transceivers for cooperative BSs, signal-level spatial registration via beamwidth adjustment, multistream communication with rank-N constraints handled by IRM, and BCD scheme for optimization.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm superiority in improving overall network performance and reducing total energy consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed TRIS transceiver-driven cooperative ISCC network effectively minimizes energy consumption while maintaining diverse network functionality.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent
surface (TRIS) transceiver-driven cooperative integrated sensing, computing,
and communication (ISCC) network to meet the requirement for a diverse network
with low energy consumption. The cooperative base stations (BSs) are equipped
with TRIS transceivers to accomplish sensing data acquisition, communication
offloading, and computation in a time slot. In order to obtain higher
cooperation gain, we utilize a signal-level spatial registration algorithm,
which is realized by adjusting the beamwidth. Meanwhile, for more efficient
offloading of the computational task, multistream communication is considered,
and rank-$N$ constraints are introduced, which are handled using an iterative
rank minimization (IRM) scheme. We construct an optimization problem with the
objective function of minimizing the total energy consumption of the network to
jointly optimize the beamforming matrix, time slot allocation, sensing data
allocation and sensing beam scheduling variables. Due to the coupling of the
variables, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which we
decouple and solve using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. Finally,
numerical simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in
improving the overall network performance and reducing the total energy
consumption of the network.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies coverage processes where draws reveal subsets of items, generalizing the Coupon Collector Problem. It introduces window models for DNA sequencing, develops combinatorial tools for exact coverage time calculation, analyzes asymptotic behavior, and studies uniform ℓ-regular models with bounds and conjectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by shotgun DNA sequencing where each draw reveals a contiguous window of fixed length, the authors aim to generalize the classical Coupon Collector's Problem to more complex coverage processes with structured subsets.

Method: Developed a unifying combinatorial tool that shifts coverage time analysis from probability to a counting problem over families of subsets. Applied this to window models (cyclic and non-cyclic), analyzed asymptotic behavior using continuous analogues, and studied uniform ℓ-regular models with bounds.

Result: Obtained exact expressions for window models, asymptotic analysis for both models, upper and lower bounds for uniform ℓ-regular models, and proved a universal upper bound showing many sampling models share the same leading asymptotic order.

Conclusion: The combinatorial approach enables exact coverage time calculation, window models provide insights for DNA sequencing applications, and uniform ℓ-regular models reveal that many sampling models have similar asymptotic behavior despite potential differences in lower-order terms.

Abstract: We study coverage processes in which each draw reveals a subset of $[n]$, and
the goal is to determine the expected number of draws until all items are seen
at least once. A classical example is the Coupon Collector's Problem, where
each draw reveals exactly one item. Motivated by shotgun DNA sequencing, we
introduce a model where each draw is a contiguous window of fixed length, in
both cyclic and non-cyclic variants. We develop a unifying combinatorial tool
that shifts the task of finding coverage time from probability, to a counting
problem over families of subsets of $[n]$ that together contain all items,
enabling exact calculation. Using this result, we obtain exact expressions for
the window models. We then leverage past results on a continuous analogue of
the cyclic window model to analyze the asymptotic behavior of both models. We
further study what we call uniform $\ell$-regular models, where every draw has
size $\ell$ and every item appears in the same number of admissible draws. We
compare these to the batch sampling model, in which all $\ell$-subsets are
drawn uniformly at random and present upper and lower bounds, which were also
obtained independently by Berend and Sher. We conjecture, and prove for special
cases, that this model maximizes the coverage time among all uniform
$\ell$-regular models. Finally, we prove a universal upper bound on the entire
class of uniform $\ell$-regular models, which illuminates the fact that many
sampling models share the same leading asymptotic order, while potentially
differing significantly in lower-order terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge network information theory and cryptographic security by exploring how noisy broadcast channels can serve as powerful primitives for multi-user privacy-preserving communication.

Method: Established general upper bounds on oblivious transfer capacity, proposed two explicit protocols: one for non-colluding receivers using binary erasure broadcast channels, and another for colluding receivers with entropy-sharing and privacy amplification mechanisms.

Result: For non-colluding case, upper and lower bounds on oblivious transfer capacity coincide, providing complete characterization of achievable region. Both protocols ensure correctness and privacy under their respective threat models.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified theoretical framework demonstrating the potential of noisy broadcast channels as powerful primitives for secure multi-user communication, with complete capacity characterization for non-colluding scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates information-theoretic oblivious transfer via a
discrete memoryless broadcast channel with one sender and two receivers. We
analyze both non-colluding and colluding honest-but-curious user models and
establish general upper bounds on the achievable oblivious transfer capacity
region for each case. Two explicit oblivious transfer protocols are proposed.
The first ensures correctness and privacy for independent, non-colluding
receivers by leveraging the structure of binary erasure broadcast channels. The
second protocol, secure even under receiver collusion, introduces additional
entropy-sharing and privacy amplification mechanisms to preserve secrecy
despite information leakage between users. Our results show that for the
non-colluding case, the upper and lower bounds on oblivious transfer capacity
coincide, providing a complete characterization of the achievable region. The
work provides a unified theoretical framework bridging network information
theory and cryptographic security, highlighting the potential of noisy
broadcast channels as powerful primitives for multi-user privacy-preserving
communication.

TL;DR: Joint resource allocation for IRS-assisted FD THz systems to maximize weighted minimum rate with fairness, addressing THz propagation challenges and residual self-interference through phase shift, power, and bandwidth optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address escalating demand for ultra-high data rates and spectral efficiency in future wireless networks while tackling practical deployment challenges of IRS-assisted FD THz systems, including severe propagation loss, frequency-dependent molecular absorption, and strong residual self-interference.

Method: Proposes joint resource allocation framework optimizing IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control, sub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment. Develops two computationally efficient algorithms under distinct spectrum partitioning schemes: equal sub-band bandwidth allocation and adaptive bandwidth allocation.

Result: Simulation results validate effectiveness of proposed designs and demonstrate significant spectral efficiency improvements over benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed joint resource allocation framework successfully addresses key challenges in IRS-assisted FD THz systems, achieving improved spectral efficiency and fairness while maintaining computational efficiency through two distinct optimization approaches.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) terahertz
(THz) communication systems have emerged as a promising paradigm to satisfy the
escalating demand for ultra-high data rates and spectral efficiency in future
wireless networks. However, the practical deployment of such systems presents
unique technical challenges, stemming from severe propagation loss,
frequency-dependent molecular absorption in the THz band, and the presence of
strong residual self-interference (SI) inherent to FD communications. To tackle
these issues, this paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that
aims to maximize the weighted minimum rate among all users, thereby ensuring
fairness in quality of service. Specifically, the proposed design jointly
optimizes IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control,
sub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment, explicitly capturing
the unique propagation characteristics of THz channels and the impact of
residual SI. To strike an balance between system performance and computational
complexity, two computationally efficient algorithms are developed under
distinct spectrum partitioning schemes: one assumes equal sub-band bandwidth
allocation to facilliate tractable optimization, while the other introduces

*Meng Hua,Haotian Wu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: AirCNN implements CNNs using over-the-air analog computation via RISs and transceiver designs to emulate CNN operations in wireless environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage wireless propagation environments for CNN computation, reducing computational overhead and enabling efficient neural network implementation through analog OTA computation.

Method: Proposes two RIS-aided architectures (MIMO and MISO) for Conv2d, optimizes transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts under practical constraints, and extends to ConvSD with distinct transmission strategies.

Result: AirCNN achieves satisfactory classification performance; Conv2d MISO outperforms MIMO, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions; multiple RISs significantly enhance performance.

Conclusion: AirCNN successfully implements CNNs via OTA computation, demonstrating the feasibility of using wireless environments for neural network operations with optimized RIS configurations.

Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging
multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we
engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations
of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of
CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight
convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d
realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided
transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and
emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the
transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical
constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift
requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires
distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can
achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO
consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD,
MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing
multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS,
especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.

### [227] [Several classes of $p$-ary linear codes with few-weights derived from Weil sums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25578)
*Mrinal Kanti Bose,Abhay Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper constructs several new classes of few-weight linear codes over finite fields using two specific defining sets, resulting in codes with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 weights, including an optimal 2-weight code meeting the Griesmer bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear codes with few weights have important applications in secret sharing schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular graphs, making them a significant research area in coding theory.

Method: The authors propose new classes of few-weight linear codes by selecting two specific defining sets. The first defining set yields 4-weight and 2-weight codes, while the second defining set uses weakly regular bent functions to generate 6-weight, 8-weight, and 9-weight codes.

Result: The paper constructs five classes of 4-weight linear codes, one class of 2-weight linear codes, two classes of 6-weight codes, two classes of 8-weight codes, and one class of 9-weight codes. All parameters and weight distributions are determined through detailed calculations on Weil sums over finite fields.

Conclusion: The research successfully produces various new few-weight linear codes with completely determined parameters, including an optimal 2-weight code that achieves the Griesmer bound, contributing to the theory and applications of linear codes.

Abstract: Linear codes with few weights have been a significant area of research in
coding theory for many years, due to their applications in secret sharing
schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular
graphs. Inspired by the works of Cheng and Gao \cite{P8} and Wu, Li and Zeng
\cite{P12}, in this paper, we propose several new classes of few-weight linear
codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ through the selection of two
specific defining sets. Consequently, we obtain five classes of $4$-weight
linear codes and one class of $2$-weight linear codes from our first defining
set. Furthermore, by employing weakly regular bent functions in our second
defining set, we derive two classes of $6$-weight codes, two classes of
$8$-weight codes, and one class of $9$-weight codes. The parameters and weight
distributions of all these constructed codes are wholly determined by detailed
calculations on certain Weil sums over finite fields. In addition, we identify
an optimal class of $2$-weight codes that meet the Griesmer bound.

### [228] [On Multidimensional 2-Weight-Limited Burst-Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25592)
*Hagai Berend,Ohad Elishco,Moshe Schwartz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies multidimensional codes that can correct burst errors of weight at most 2, with specific constraints on the relative positions of the two error locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient error-correcting codes for multidimensional data where errors occur in bursts with limited spatial separation between error positions.

Method: The authors study three types of burst error constraints: bounded L∞ distance, bounded L1 distance, and axis-parallel line constraints with bounded distance. They provide explicit code constructions for each case.

Result: The paper presents specific code constructions for each of the three burst error models and compares their excess redundancy against proven lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides practical multidimensional code constructions for burst error correction with theoretical performance analysis showing how close the constructions are to optimal redundancy.

Abstract: We consider multidimensional codes capable of correcting a burst error of
weight at most $2$. When two positions are in error, the burst limits their
relative position. We study three such limitations: the $L_\infty$ distance
between the positions is bounded, the $L_1$ distance between the positions is
bounded, or the two positions are on an axis-parallel line with bounded
distance between them. In all cases we provide explicit code constructions, and
compare their excess redundancy to a lower bound we prove.

### [229] [Effect of Full Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25736)
*Shreya Meel,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on graph-replicated databases, where messages are stored on servers connected by edges. The authors develop an algorithm to convert PIR schemes to SPIR schemes and derive capacity bounds for path and cyclic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the improvement in SPIR capacity compared to settings with graph-replicated common randomness, and to understand how database replication topology affects private information retrieval performance.

Method: Developed an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into corresponding SPIR schemes, establishing capacity lower bounds. Analyzed path and cyclic graphs specifically.

Result: Established capacity lower bounds for graphs where such conversion schemes exist. Derived tighter capacity upper bounds for path and cyclic graphs than trivial PIR bounds. For 3-vertex path graphs, identified SPIR capacity as 1/2.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into SPIR capacity improvements in graph-replicated database settings and presents concrete capacity results for specific graph topologies like path graphs.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in
settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here,
each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers
if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of
database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness,
independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR
capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded
symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness.
Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into
the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on
graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic
graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the
trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of
path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be
$\frac{1}{2}$.

*Steven Campbell,Ting-Kam Leonard Wong*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper connects the excess growth rate from portfolio theory to information theory concepts like Rényi entropy and cross entropy, providing axiomatic characterizations and comparing it with growth optimal portfolios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical connections between the excess growth rate in portfolio theory and fundamental concepts in information theory, providing new insights into quantitative finance.

Method: The authors use axiomatic characterization theorems to connect the excess growth rate to relative entropy, Jensen's inequality gap, and logarithmic divergence. They also study maximization of the excess growth rate.

Result: Three main axiomatic characterization theorems are established, linking the excess growth rate to (i) relative entropy, (ii) Jensen's inequality gap, and (iii) logarithmic divergence generalizing Bregman divergence.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical justifications for the significance of the excess growth rate and establishes new connections between information theory and quantitative finance.

Abstract: We study the excess growth rate -- a fundamental logarithmic functional
arising in portfolio theory -- from the perspective of information theory. We
show that the excess growth rate can be connected to the R\'{e}nyi and cross
entropies, the Helmholtz free energy, L. Campbell's measure of average code
length and large deviations. Our main results consist of three axiomatic
characterization theorems of the excess growth rate, in terms of (i) the
relative entropy, (ii) the gap in Jensen's inequality, and (iii) the
logarithmic divergence that generalizes the Bregman divergence. Furthermore, we
study maximization of the excess growth rate and compare it with the growth
optimal portfolio. Our results not only provide theoretical justifications of
the significance of the excess growth rate, but also establish new connections
between information theory and quantitative finance.
