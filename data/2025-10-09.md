### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a route-specific, milestone-based approach for railway automation vision systems to address data limitations and improve real-time decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision systems in railway automation face challenges due to limited high-quality sequential data and lack of spatio-temporal context, while alternative solutions suffer from realism and applicability issues.

Method: The approach focuses on route-specific, contextually relevant cues to generate rich sequential datasets, using milestone determination to develop targeted rule-based models that simplify learning by focusing on critical decision points rather than generalized dynamic component recognition.

Result: The method enables generation of datasets that align closely with real-world operational logic and provides a practical framework for training vision agents.

Conclusion: This milestone-based approach facilitates safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation by enabling training in controlled, predictable environments.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CML-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating movie script quality in LLMs, focusing on dialogue coherence, character consistency, and plot reasonableness. It also proposes CML-Instruction to improve LLM-generated scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate structurally organized texts but lack the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth required for compelling movie scripts, failing to capture the 'soul' of cinema.

Method: Created CML-Dataset with (summary, content) pairs from high-quality movie scripts, analyzed narrative structures, developed CML-Bench with three quality dimensions, and introduced CML-Instruction prompting strategy.

Result: CML-Bench effectively identifies weaknesses in LLM-generated scripts and assigns high scores to human-written scripts. CML-Instruction helps LLMs generate higher-quality screenplays aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and instruction strategy successfully address LLMs' deficiencies in cinematic script generation, enabling better evaluation and improvement of movie script quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVSD is a spammer detection model that treats user behavior as video frames, using pixelization and video classification techniques to identify spammers with improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by video classification technology, viewing user behavior subspace as frame images and consecutive behaviors as videos to develop a novel spammer detection approach.

Method: Proposes UVSD model with three main components: user2piexl algorithm for pixelizing users (stance as RGB values), behavior2image algorithm for transforming behavior subspace into frame images using representation learning and diffusion algorithms, and constructing user behavior videos based on temporal features combined with video classification.

Result: Experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets show UVSD model outperforms state-of-the-art spammer detection methods.

Conclusion: The video-based approach to spammer detection through user behavior videoization proves effective and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study integrates Monte Carlo Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model for surface landmine/UXO classification to quantify prediction uncertainty, demonstrating improved reliability under adversarial and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic neural networks for landmine detection are vulnerable to noise and adversarial attacks, potentially leading to dangerous missed detections or misclassifications in humanitarian demining operations.

Method: Used Monte Carlo Dropout integrated into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, tested on simulated datasets under clean, adversarial, and noisy conditions.

Result: The model successfully flagged unreliable predictions under challenging conditions, providing additional reliability metrics through uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about neural network vulnerabilities to adversarial threats, and emphasizes developing more robust models for practical applications.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars is an open toolkit for deterministic fusion of intravascular imaging and CCTA data, enabling multi-state coronary analysis with high performance and pipeline integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack open, flexible tools for multi-state coronary analysis that combine high-resolution intravascular imaging with 3D CCTA geometry while ensuring deterministic behavior and reproducibility.

Method: Uses deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centered data model, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable performance. Accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including AIVUS-CAA formats.

Result: Provides a toolkit that enables reliable 3D coronary model building by fusing complementary imaging modalities with deterministic behavior and high performance.

Conclusion: multimodars fills the gap for open, flexible multi-state coronary analysis tools that offer reproducibility, scalability, and easy pipeline integration.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show strong visual perception but weak physical dynamics understanding, with fragmented skills that don't combine into causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark VLMs' ability to understand and predict physical dynamics, as current models show strong perception but unclear physics reasoning capabilities.

Method: Benchmarked 6 frontier VLMs on 3 physical simulation datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) with diagnostic subtests isolating perception from physics reasoning.

Result: Weak correlations found between diagnostic performance and evaluation accuracy - models excelling at perception or physics reasoning don't consistently perform better on predictive/counterfactual tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fragmented perceptual and physics skills that fail to combine into causal understanding, highlighting the need for architectures that better bind perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced self-distillation framework for SNNs that reduces training complexity while achieving high performance by projecting SNN firing rates onto lightweight ANN branches and using reliable self-generated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SNN training methods based on surrogate gradients and BPTT lag behind ANNs in performance while incurring significant computational and memory overheads that grow linearly with temporal dimension.

Method: Joint optimization of enhanced self-distillation with rate-based backpropagation, projecting SNN firing rates onto lightweight ANN branches, and decoupling teacher signals into reliable/unreliable components to ensure only reliable knowledge guides optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate reduced training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables high-performance SNN training under limited computational resources by addressing the limitations of traditional self-distillation and conventional SNN training approaches.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified AI framework for dermatological diagnostics combining heterogeneous neural network ensembles with integrated language models to improve diagnostic reliability and patient communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current dermatological AI systems including inter-observer variability, dataset biases, fragmented approaches, and lack of integrated clinical communication.

Method: Two synergistic innovations: 1) Heterogeneous ensemble of diverse CNNs with uncertainty mechanisms for specialist referral, 2) Direct integration of LLMs into diagnostic workflow to generate structured clinical reports and patient education.

Result: Created a cohesive system that bridges diagnostic reliability and communication gaps, generating clinically meaningful assessments with precise lesion characterization and actionable guidance.

Conclusion: The framework represents significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while supporting continuum of care from detection through patient education, improving early intervention rates.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Online Generic Event Boundary Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06855)
*Hyungrok Jung,Daneul Kim,Seunggyun Lim,Jeany Son,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD) for real-time event boundary detection in streaming videos, proposing Estimator framework inspired by human event segmentation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEBD methods require complete video frames unlike human online processing, creating a gap between computational methods and human perception of events.

Method: Proposes Estimator framework with Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) to predict future frames and Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) to measure prediction errors and adaptively detect boundaries using statistical tests.

Result: Outperforms baselines from online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to offline-GEBD methods on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD framework successfully bridges the gap between offline processing and human-like online event boundary detection in streaming videos.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

### [10] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data into 22 existing classes plus 2 new classes from O3a run, achieving 92.26% classification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient noise in LIGO data hinders gravitational wave detection, and with the O3 run adding two new noise classes, new models are needed for effective classification.

Method: Train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset of Gravity Spy dataset with two additional classes from LIGO O3a run.

Result: Achieved 92.26% classification efficiency, demonstrating ViT's potential to improve gravitational wave detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer effectively distinguishes transient noise and can improve gravitational wave detection by accurately classifying glitches.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

### [11] [General and Efficient Visual Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning using Object-Agnostic Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06277)
*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based goal representation system for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that enables object-agnostic visual learning, achieving high accuracy without positional information and demonstrating successful sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal representation methods like target state images, 3D coordinates, and one-hot vectors suffer from poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and dependency on special cameras.

Method: Proposed a mask-based goal representation that provides object-agnostic visual cues, processed to generate dense rewards without distance calculations. Uses ground truth masks in simulation and pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation in real-world applications.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects. Successfully performed pick-up tasks with high accuracy without positional information. Demonstrated learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer using two physical robots.

Conclusion: Mask-based goal representation enables efficient learning, superior generalization, and practical real-world deployment without the limitations of traditional goal representation methods.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [12] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAN-based super-resolution approach enhances low-resolution Hα solar images from GONG to match high-resolution BBSO/GST quality, recovering fine details in sunspots, filaments and fibrils.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale dynamic features, but current full-disk Hα images have limited spatial resolution that cannot resolve small-scale structures like filaments and fibrils.

Method: Used Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and relativistic discriminator on carefully aligned GONG-GST image pairs for super-resolution enhancement.

Result: Model effectively recovers fine details in sunspot penumbrae and resolves filaments/fibrils with MSE 467.15, RMSE 21.59, and cross-correlation 0.7794.

Conclusion: Approach successfully enhances solar image resolution, though slight misalignments limit quantitative performance; future work will address alignment issues and expand dataset for better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [13] [SDQM: Synthetic Data Quality Metric for Object Detection Dataset Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06596)
*Ayush Zenith,Arnold Zumbrun,Neel Raut,Jing Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDQM, a new metric for evaluating synthetic dataset quality in object detection tasks without requiring model training, showing strong correlation with mAP scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets and the need for effective evaluation metrics for synthetic data in object detection tasks.

Method: Proposes Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) that assesses data quality without requiring model training convergence.

Result: SDQM demonstrated strong correlation with YOLOv11 mAP scores, outperforming previous metrics that showed only moderate or weak correlations.

Conclusion: SDQM provides an efficient, scalable metric for synthetic data evaluation that enables better dataset generation and selection while reducing costly iterative training.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

### [14] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method that reduces relation hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by using multi-perspective questions and interleaved chains of images and text to guide progressive relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion among three categories of hallucinations in LVLMs but have received the least attention, hindering model reliability.

Method: ChainMPQ extracts subject/object keywords to enhance image regions, constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on subject, object, and relation components, and uses sequential input with accumulated textual/visual memories to form interleaved chains for progressive reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Conclusion: ChainMPQ effectively addresses relation hallucinations in LVLMs through its training-free approach using multi-perspective questioning and interleaved memory chains.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

### [15] [Efficient High-Resolution Image Editing with Hallucination-Aware Loss and Adaptive Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06295)
*Young D. Kwon,Abhinav Mehrotra,Malcolm Chadwick,Alberto Gil Ramos,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso enables efficient 4K image editing on mobile devices using a three-stage approach with hallucination-aware loss, latent projection, and adaptive tiling, achieving significant speed-up and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image editing face memory and quality challenges on resource-constrained mobile devices, especially at high resolutions like 4K.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) image editing at standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (2) latent projection to avoid pixel space conversion, (3) upscaling with adaptive context-preserving tiling.

Result: 18-48% image quality improvement, 14-51% reduction in hallucinations, up to 55.8× speed-up with only 9% memory increase. On-device runtime faster than server-based A100 GPU model.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso successfully enables efficient high-resolution image editing on mobile devices with superior performance and minimal resource overhead.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Implementation of AI-based Gaze Tracking using RGBD images with Transformer feature fusion, achieving competitive results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored combination of RGBD input images and Transformers for gaze tracking, and create a new dataset since existing ones lack depth information or suitable labels for Gaze Angle Estimation.

Method: Uses RGBD images with Transformer architecture for feature fusion, based on Lian et al.'s GAN approach. Created new dataset and tested various configurations including Transformer vs MLP modules.

Result: Transformer model achieved 55.3mm mean Euclidean error on ShanghaiTechGaze+, but removing pre-trained GAN improved to 30.1mm. MLP replacement further improved to 26.9mm. On ETH-XGaze, Transformer achieved 3.59° vs 3.26° without Transformer, while state-of-the-art achieved 2.04°.

Conclusion: While Transformers show promise for feature fusion in gaze tracking, simpler MLP architectures can achieve better performance. The combination of RGBD images with appropriate feature fusion methods is effective for gaze estimation tasks.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework fusing GEDI lidar with SAR data to create global, high-resolution forest structural complexity maps at 25m resolution with high accuracy (R²=0.82).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEDI lidar provides forest structural complexity metrics but has sparse sampling, limiting continuous high-resolution mapping. There's a need for wall-to-wall global mapping to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

Method: Adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on 130+ million GEDI footprints, fused with multimodal SAR datasets. Uses transfer learning for additional forest variables with minimal computational cost.

Result: Achieved global R²=0.82 with <400,000 parameters. Produced global multi-temporal dataset (2015-2022) with calibrated uncertainty estimates across biomes, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns.

Conclusion: This scalable framework enables continuous multi-temporal monitoring of global forest structural dynamics, providing accessible tools for conservation and management in changing climate conditions.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA is a lightweight, annotation-free framework for face image recognizability assessment that uses embedding space geometry to define recognizability via class-center similarity and angular separation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external labels or backbone-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition in unconstrained environments faces extreme variations in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict recognizability. Existing FIQA methods rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or intensive generative pipelines, leaving predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry.

Method: TransFIRA uses transfer learning to ground recognizability directly in embedding space through class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS). It employs a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C datasets, nearly doubles correlation with true recognizability, and shows strong performance on body recognition with robustness under cross-dataset shifts.

Conclusion: TransFIRA establishes a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment that is encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities, significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning models using CNN and random forests trained on 22,000 labeled camera images to automatically classify road surface conditions for NYSDOT, achieving 81.5% accuracy on unseen cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NYSDOT needs to evaluate road conditions during winter weather through labor-intensive manual observation of cameras and road driving. Machine learning can provide automated support for critical operational decisions.

Method: Trained convolutional neural networks and random forests on ~22,000 hand-labeled camera images classified into six road surface conditions (severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, obstructed) combined with weather data.

Result: The weather-related road surface condition model achieved 81.5% accuracy on completely unseen cameras, prioritizing model generalizability for operational needs.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can successfully automate road condition classification with high accuracy, providing valuable support for transportation departments' winter weather decision-making.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDiff is a patch-based diffusion framework for thermal image restoration that addresses low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and other localized degradations in low-cost thermal cameras by training on small patches and restoring full-resolution images through denoising and spatial blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images from low-cost cameras suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations, while available thermal imaging datasets are limited in size and diversity, creating challenges for effective restoration methods.

Method: A patch-based diffusion framework that trains on small thermal patches to leverage the local nature of distortions, then restores full-resolution images by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing.

Result: Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong performance on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing the method as a unified restoration pipeline.

Conclusion: TDiff represents the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks, effectively addressing the challenges of low-cost thermal imaging.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches in multi-subject identity-preserved generation by enabling unified guidance through structural and spatial constraints at different precision levels.

Method: Introduces SIGMA-SET27K dataset with identity, structure, and spatial information for 100k+ subjects across 27k images, and develops a framework supporting user guidance from coarse boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image generation quality, and speed through extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN provides an effective unified solution for multi-identity preserving image generation with flexible user guidance capabilities.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both

boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIGRID is a new superpixel-based data structure that encodes color and shape information while reducing input dimensionality, achieving comparable or better performance than pixel-level representations in segmentation tasks with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superpixels offer computational benefits but their irregular distribution has limited their use in deep learning, requiring specialized architectures that undermine their original efficiency advantages.

Method: Developed SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid) using classical shape descriptors to encode superpixel color and shape information, creating a structured representation that reduces input dimensionality for segmentation tasks.

Result: Evaluation on four benchmark datasets with two convolutional segmentation architectures showed SIGRIDs match or surpass pixel-level performance while significantly accelerating model training.

Conclusion: SIGRIDs successfully balance accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that superpixel-based representations can be effectively integrated into standard deep learning architectures without performance loss.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Text2Interact framework generates realistic human-human interactions from text using scalable data synthesis and fine-grained spatiotemporal coordination, addressing limitations in training data and text-to-interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modeling human-human interactions due to limited two-person training data and coarse text conditioning that collapses rich prompts into single embeddings, hindering realistic spatiotemporal coupling.

Method: Proposes InterCompose for scalable interaction data synthesis by composing LLM-generated descriptions with single-person motions, and InterActor with word-level conditioning and adaptive interaction loss for fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including successful performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and positive user study results.

Conclusion: Text2Interact framework effectively addresses key limitations in human-human interaction modeling through scalable data synthesis and fine-grained text conditioning, enabling realistic and text-aligned interaction generation.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Motivation: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of informative frames from long videos to reduce computational costs while retaining semantic and contextual information.

Method: Proposes KeyScore framework that jointly leverages captions and visual context to estimate frame importance, combining semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact. Also introduces STACFP for generating compact and diverse frame proposals for long videos.

Result: Achieves up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperforms standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo datasets for retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding without explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and

TL;DR: LogSTOP is a scoring function that efficiently computes temporal property scores over sequences using local detectors like YOLO and HuBERT, outperforming large language models and other baselines in query matching and ranked retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifting local detection scores (e.g., object detection in videos, emotion detection in audio) to temporal properties over sequences is useful for downstream applications like query matching and ranked retrieval, but existing methods struggle with noisy local predictors.

Method: Proposed LogSTOP scoring function that efficiently computes scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic, using potentially noisy local property predictors like YOLO, HuBERT, Grounding DINO, and SlowR50.

Result: LogSTOP outperforms Large Vision/Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech. On ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP achieves at least 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines.

Conclusion: LogSTOP provides an effective method for scoring temporal properties over sequences using local detectors, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches for temporal query matching and ranked retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle electron tomography suffers from missing-wedge artifacts, and existing deep learning methods require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth that are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy.

Method: Proposed TEMDiff, a 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework trained on volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series. The method operates directly on 3D volumes and implicitly enforces consistency across slices without additional regularization.

Result: TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage. It generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts under different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments without retraining.

Conclusion: TEMDiff effectively addresses the missing-wedge problem in limited-angle electron tomography by leveraging diffusion models and simulated training data, achieving superior reconstruction quality and strong generalization to real-world TEM data without requiring clean ground truth.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: VUGEN is a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models' pretrained visual understanding for efficient image generation without complex bridging mechanisms or autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for adding image generation to VLMs rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations or architectural complexity.

Method: VUGEN transforms the VLM's high-dimensional latent space into a lower-dimensional distribution, trains the VLM to sample within this reduced space, and uses a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to map generated latents back to image space.

Result: VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages VLM's visual understanding priors for high-quality image generation with improved performance metrics and preserved understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding

### [29] [Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06541)
*Nicholas M. Kroeger,Vincent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cluster paths is a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents inputs as sequences of cluster IDs, providing human-readable explanations for neural network decisions while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep neural networks are opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. There is a need for interpretability methods that can explain model decisions in human-readable ways.

Method: Cluster activations at selected layers and represent each input as its sequence of cluster IDs (cluster paths). For Vision Transformers, extend to concept paths using large language models on minimal path divergences. Evaluate using four metrics: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement.

Result: In spurious-cue CIFAR-10, cluster paths identified color-based shortcuts and collapsed when cue was removed. On CelebA hair-color task: 90% faithfulness, 96% agreement under noise without accuracy loss. Successfully scaled to ImageNet-pretrained Vision Transformers. Also effective as OOD detector, flagging anomalies before over-confident predictions.

Conclusion: Cluster paths uncover visual concepts at multiple network depths, scale to large vision models, and generate concise human-readable explanations while maintaining model performance and providing reliable interpretability.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

*Qiongyang Hu,Wenyang Liu,Wenbin Zou,Yuejiao Su,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSNet is a novel graph-based framework for image super-resolution that decomposes global graphs into manageable sub-components to achieve computational efficiency while maintaining high reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution suffer from structural inflexibility (CNNs/attention) or excessive computational complexity (graph-based methods), creating a need for a solution that balances representational adaptability with computational feasibility.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet) with three key components: Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) generates diverse complementary subgraphs capturing heterogeneous characteristics; Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates representations through adaptive weighting and fusion; Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) selectively retains salient features to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HSNet successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by efficiently leveraging graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility, achieving superior performance in image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

*Fei Zhang,Rob Chancia,Josie Clapp,Amirhossein Hassanzadeh,Dimah Dera,Richard MacKenzie,Jan van Aardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-automated pipeline for semantic segmentation of TLS point clouds that reduces manual annotation effort through uncertainty-aware ensemble learning, spherical projection, and targeted annotation guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is costly and time-consuming, limiting the scalability of semantic segmentation for ecological monitoring applications like mangrove forest analysis.

Method: Projects 3D points to 2D spherical grid, enriches with multi-source features, trains ensemble of segmentation networks to generate pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, then back-projects to 3D with visualization tools for targeted annotation.

Result: Performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans with mIoU plateauing at 0.76; geometric features contribute most; compact nine-channel feature stacks capture nearly all discriminative power; method generalizes to other datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable, high-quality TLS segmentation with reduced annotation effort, supported by the new Mangrove3D dataset and empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

### [32] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation using DANN maintains CT image classification accuracy on new ring artifacts without requiring labeled artifact data, outperforming baseline and traditional augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models fail on CT images with new artifacts not seen during training, and labeling new artifact distributions is costly. Domain adaptation offers a more accessible solution.

Method: Simulated ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space, evaluated DANN against baseline and augmentation approaches on OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset.

Result: DANN maintained high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data, comparable to models trained with labeled artifacts, and showed unexpected generalization to uniform noise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation effectively addresses distribution shift in medical imaging without expensive expert labeling, making it promising for clinical deployment where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MingTok introduces continuous latent space visual tokenizers to unify vision understanding and generation under autoregressive paradigm, addressing quantization limitations of discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete visual tokenizers suffer from quantization errors that limit semantic expressiveness and degrade vision-language understanding capabilities.

Method: Three-stage sequential architecture with low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction; Ming-UniVision unifies tasks under single autoregressive prediction paradigm.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across both understanding and generation domains by reconciling competing requirements through unified continuous visual representation.

Conclusion: Continuous visual tokenization successfully unifies vision understanding and generation, supporting multi-round in-context tasks like iterative understanding, generation and editing.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trainable color normalization model based on Beer-Lambert law physics that addresses domain shift in digital pathology by extracting stain-invariant structural information through unrolled NMF, outperforming existing stain normalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color variability in digital pathology due to different staining protocols and imaging conditions reduces deep learning model performance when deployed on data from different domains (domain shift problem). Existing color normalization methods have drawbacks like introducing artifacts or requiring careful template selection.

Method: Proposed BeerLaNet - a trainable color normalization model integrated with backbone networks. Based on Beer-Lambert law physics, uses algorithmic unrolling of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract stain-invariant structural information from pathology images.

Result: Evaluated on public pathology datasets and internal malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification. Outperformed many state-of-the-art stain normalization methods.

Conclusion: The proposed trainable color normalization model effectively addresses domain shift in digital pathology by extracting stain-invariant features through physics-based unrolled NMF approach, showing superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

*Jingran Xu,Yuanyuan Liu,Yanjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnrollINR is a zero-shot self-supervised framework for fast MRI reconstruction that combines physics-guided unrolled iterative architecture with Implicit Neural Representation as regularization prior, achieving superior performance without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scan times are prolonged, limiting clinical application. While deep learning methods show promise, fully sampled data for supervised training is often difficult to obtain, necessitating self-supervised approaches.

Method: Proposes UnrollINR framework with physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture using Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as regularization prior to constrain solution space, combining deep unrolled structure with INR's implicit representation capability.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance even at high acceleration rate of 10, outperforming supervised learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot self-supervised UnrollINR framework effectively enables scan-specific MRI reconstruction without external training data, demonstrating enhanced interpretability and performance through the combination of unrolled architecture and INR regularization.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: MuEx is a multilingual talking face synthesis framework that uses phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio and video modalities, achieving lifelike facial animations across multiple languages with effective zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFS models perform well in English but poorly in non-English languages due to English-dominated training datasets and lack of cross-language generalization abilities, producing wrong mouth shapes and rigid facial expressions.

Method: Proposes Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that extracts audio and video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, and introduces Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) to establish robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across all 12 languages in the Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) and effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Conclusion: MuEx successfully addresses multilingual TFS challenges by using phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries, achieving lifelike facial animations across diverse languages with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

TL;DR: MSITrack is the largest multispectral single object tracking dataset with 300 videos, 129k+ frames, 55 object categories, and 300 natural scenes, designed to address limitations of RGB-based trackers through enhanced spectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based trackers struggle with real-world challenges like occlusion, similar object interference, and complex backgrounds. Limited availability of multispectral tracking datasets restricts development of more robust trackers.

Method: Created MSITrack dataset with 300 videos containing over 129k multispectral frames across 55 object categories and 300 natural scenes. Used meticulous manual labeling and multi-stage verification for annotation precision.

Result: Extensive evaluations show multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves tracking performance over RGB-only baselines, demonstrating enhanced target discriminability in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: MSITrack addresses the scarcity of multispectral tracking datasets and provides a comprehensive benchmark that can drive future advancements in multispectral object tracking research.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral

highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications in implicit-knowledge KVQA, leading to poor generalization after standard supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision, using only one open-source MLLM without external retrievers or knowledge bases.

Result: Achieves up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA effectively supervises structured reasoning traces to make reasoning transparent and verifiable, demonstrating strong performance in implicit-knowledge visual question answering without external knowledge sources.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

TL;DR: AutoNAD is an automated neural architecture design framework for industrial surface defect detection that searches over convolutions, transformers, and MLPs to address intraclass difference and interclass similarity challenges while optimizing for runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial surface defect detection faces challenges with intraclass difference (same defect type appearing differently) and interclass similarity (different defects looking similar). Existing manual design methods require extensive trial and error and struggle to address both challenges effectively.

Method: Proposes AutoNAD framework that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons in a hybrid design. Uses cross weight sharing strategy for efficient training and searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) for multi-scale feature learning. Incorporates latency-aware prior for efficient architecture selection.

Result: Validated on three industrial defect datasets and applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. The framework addresses both intraclass difference and interclass similarity challenges while reducing manual network design costs.

Conclusion: AutoNAD provides an effective automated solution for industrial surface defect detection that captures both local variations and long-range context, achieving good detection accuracy while maintaining runtime efficiency for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based editing relies only on text which fails to capture specific details, while subject-driven generation is limited to concrete objects and ignores abstract concepts - both are inadequate for practical user needs.

Method: Proposes data synthesis pipeline with feature mixing for concept extraction, multimodal instruction training data generation, and framework with index/position encoding to handle multi-image inputs plus joint VLM training for complex instructions.

Result: DreamOmni2 achieved impressive results on comprehensive benchmarks created for the new multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by supporting multimodal inputs and handling both concrete and abstract concepts, enhancing practical applications in image editing and generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

### [43] [Semantic Segmentation Algorithm Based on Light Field and LiDAR Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06687)
*Jie Luo,Yuxuan Jiang,Xin Jin,Mingyu Liu,Yihui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal semantic segmentation method that fuses light field and LiDAR point cloud data using feature completion and depth perception modules to improve segmentation accuracy, especially for occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation faces challenges under complex conditions like occlusion. Light field and LiDAR provide complementary visual and spatial cues, but their integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and modality discrepancies.

Method: Proposed Mlpfseg network with two key modules: feature completion module addresses density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels through differential reconstruction, and depth perception module improves occlusion awareness by reinforcing attention scores.

Result: Outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 mIoU and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion approach effectively integrates light field and LiDAR data, improving semantic segmentation performance particularly for occluded objects through feature completion and enhanced depth perception.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; how- ever, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential re- construction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image- only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: SCas4D is a cascaded optimization framework that uses hierarchical deformation patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes, achieving fast convergence and comparable results with significantly fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent dynamic scene modeling faces challenges in capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency, as real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns.

Method: A cascaded optimization framework that progressively refines deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level using structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. Effective in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking.

Conclusion: SCas4D provides an efficient and effective approach for dynamic scene modeling by leveraging hierarchical deformation patterns, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents an evaluation framework for LLM-based OCR in historical document digitization, addressing temporal biases and period-specific errors that traditional metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital humanities scholars lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR, as traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation.

Method: Developed an evaluation methodology using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, introducing novel metrics (HCPR and AIR) with protocols for contamination control and stability testing, evaluating 12 multimodal LLMs.

Result: Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR but exhibit over-historicization by inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance.

Conclusion: The methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba integrates frequency-aware state-space modeling and multi-directional convolution for superior image deraining with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba-based models have limitations in capturing fine-grained details and lack frequency-domain awareness, restricting further improvements in image deraining performance.

Method: Proposes DeRainMamba with Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) using Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from details, and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) to restore local structures through anisotropic gradient features.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework is effective for single image deraining.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

*Junhan Zhu,Hesong Wang,Mingluo Su,Zefang Wang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OBS-Diff is a one-shot pruning framework that compresses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models without training, using adapted Optimal Brain Surgeon with timestep-aware Hessian construction and group-wise sequential pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models suffer from prohibitive computational costs, and existing one-shot pruning methods cannot handle their iterative denoising nature.

Method: Revitalizes Optimal Brain Surgeon for diffusion model architectures, proposes timestep-aware Hessian with logarithmic-decrease weighting for earlier timesteps, and uses group-wise sequential pruning to amortize calibration costs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff successfully bridges the gap between one-shot pruning methods and diffusion models, enabling efficient compression while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

### [48] [Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a Single Denoiser for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06757)
*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A histogram matching approach transforms arbitrary noise to Gaussian distribution, enabling a single Gaussian denoiser to handle various out-of-distribution noises through a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Gaussian denoisers have limited generalization for out-of-distribution noise due to diverse noise characteristics across different types.

Method: Proposes histogram matching to transform arbitrary noise to target Gaussian distribution, with specific techniques: local histogram matching for signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation for channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching with pixel-shuffle down-sampling for spatial correlation.

Result: The method enables a single Gaussian denoiser to handle various out-of-distribution noises including Poisson, salt-and-pepper, repeating pattern noises, and complex real-world noises with superior generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed histogram matching approach with mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising significantly enhances the generalization capability of Gaussian denoisers for diverse noise types.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

### [49] [A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Deep Multiple Instance Learning method for training high-resolution land-cover classifiers using weak low-resolution labels, with flexible pooling layers and Positive-Unlabeled Learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of limited high-quality training labels for land-cover mapping by leveraging abundant but low-resolution reference data like MODIS products.

Method: Uses flexible pooling layers to link pixel-level semantics to patch-level labels, reframing MIL in multi-class and multi-label settings with Positive-Unlabeled Learning for cases where low-resolution labels only indicate presence.

Result: Experimental results on IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate effectiveness compared to standard training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully trains pixel-level classifiers using weak supervision from low-resolution data, enabling high-resolution land-cover mapping without direct high-resolution labels.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

*Akshit Singh,Shyam Marjit,Wei Lin,Paul Gavrikov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,M. Jehanzeb Mirza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV enhances vision language models through test-time reinforcement learning without labeled data, using frequency-based rewards and entropy control to improve object recognition and VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods require labeled data and training splits, which contrasts with human learning from the environment. The goal is to enable models to adapt at inference time without labeled data.

Method: Enhances GRPO framework with frequency-based rewards from base model outputs and entropy control for output diversity. Uses multiple inferences per test sample and adapts on the fly during inference.

Result: Achieved up to 52.4% improvement in object recognition and 29.8% in VQA, with average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpassed GPT-4o by 2.3% on image recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: Test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed proprietary models, works even in data-constrained scenarios with single unlabeled examples, and demonstrates practical viability for vision language models.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a heatmap-based extreme amodal face detector that uses contextual cues from single images to efficiently predict unseen faces outside the frame, outperforming generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and privacy applications by detecting objects not visible in the input image but present in an expanded field-of-view, focusing on face detection as a motivating class.

Method: A heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector with selective coarse-to-fine decoder that uses contextual cues from single images to efficiently predict unseen regions without sampling.

Result: The method establishes strong results for extreme amodal detection, outperforming less efficient generative approaches on the single-image task.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-free approach effectively addresses extreme amodal detection using contextual cues from single images, providing an efficient alternative to generative methods.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables ultrasound foundation models to provide real-time probe guidance for junior sonographers to acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, addressing the shortage of skilled personnel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of highly skilled sonographers for cardiac ultrasound due to high operational difficulty, which prevents patients from receiving timely examinations. High-quality ultrasound images are essential for accurate diagnosis using foundation models.

Method: The authors design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables foundation models' image encoders to encode vision-action sequences, allowing the model to learn probe adjustment strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance models in providing operational recommendations for acquiring high-quality ultrasound images.

Conclusion: The VA-Adapter successfully adapts medical knowledge from foundation models to probe guidance tasks, enabling junior sonographers to obtain high-quality cardiac ultrasound images through real-time operational recommendations.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

*Mitchell Keren Taraday,Shahaf Wagner,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDJE is an efficient vision-language reranker that precomputes and compresses visual tokens offline, enabling high-throughput inference while maintaining strong retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language rerankers like BLIP are bottlenecked by expensive visual feature extraction, preventing practical deployment at scale. There's a lack of efficient joint encoders comparable to text retrieval rerankers.

Method: Precompute vision tokens offline and compress them via a lightweight attention-based adapter. Online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus text.

Result: EDJE processes 50k image-text pairs/second with 49kB storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval.

Conclusion: EDJE enables practical deployment of vision-language rerankers at scale by drastically reducing storage and online compute while preserving strong retrieval performance.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

### [54] [StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06827)
*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce content leakage in visual prompting for text-to-image generation by extending classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention and introducing negative visual query guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual prompting methods in text-to-image generation suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements from visual style prompts are transferred along with the intended style.

Method: 1) Extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) with swapping self-attention, and 2) propose negative visual query guidance (NVQG) that uses negative scores by simulating content leakage scenarios through query swapping in self-attention layers.

Result: The method significantly reduces content leakage and demonstrates superiority over existing approaches across various styles and text prompts, effectively reflecting reference styles while matching text prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed NVQG method provides a simple yet effective solution to content leakage in visual prompting, enabling better control over style transfer in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a high-resolution event-based camera, achieving higher accuracy than existing methods without needing frame cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras efficiently capture geometric features but current methods either rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates from modern high-resolution sensors.

Method: A lattice-allocated pipeline with velocity-invariant event representation, line segment detection using fitting scores, and line segment tracking through endpoint perturbation.

Result: Demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines on both custom and public datasets.

Conclusion: Enables fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings without requiring additional frame cameras.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual AQA (CAQA) to handle evolving quality distributions in action assessment, proposes MAGR++ method with adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting while enabling effective representation learning, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on new CAQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world Action Quality Assessment scenarios and the limited generalization ability of conventional methods, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings.

Method: Proposes MAGR++ with adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization: full-parameter fine-tuning for representation learning, manifold projector to translate historical features, and graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. Stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over strongest baselines. Constructed four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: MAGR++ effectively addresses the challenges of continual learning in AQA by balancing representation learning with forgetting mitigation through manifold alignment and graph regularization, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

*Adrien Dorise,Marjorie Bellizzi,Adrien Girard,Benjamin Francesconi,Stéphane May*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using raw satellite sensor data for onboard AI object detection, finding that while performance is similar to preprocessed data at lower confidence levels, raw data models struggle with object boundaries at high confidence thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing satellite processing power, deploying AI models directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible, but current approaches mainly use preprocessed ground-based products rather than raw sensor data.

Method: Introduced a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, trained two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) on both raw and L1 datasets, and compared performance using standard detection metrics and explainability tools.

Result: Both models performed similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, but the model trained on raw data struggled with object boundary identification at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

### [58] [HARP-NeXt: High-Speed and Accurate Range-Point Fusion Network for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06876)
*Samir Abou Haidar,Alexandre Chariot,Mehdi Darouich,Cyril Joly,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt is a high-speed LiDAR semantic segmentation network that achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off through novel pre-processing, efficient feature extraction, and multi-scale fusion, running 24x faster than top methods without TTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR segmentation methods face accuracy-speed trade-offs: point-based/sparse convolution methods are accurate but slow, while projection-based methods are faster but lose geometric information. Pre-processing overhead and TTA usage further slow inference on embedded systems.

Method: Proposes novel pre-processing to reduce computational overhead, Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction blocks for efficient representation capture without deep stacking, and multi-scale range-point fusion backbone to preserve geometric details at multiple abstraction levels.

Result: Achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, comparable to top-ranked PTv3 while running 24x faster, without using ensemble models or test-time augmentation.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt demonstrates that high accuracy and real-time performance in LiDAR semantic segmentation can be achieved simultaneously through optimized pre-processing, efficient feature extraction, and multi-scale fusion, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

TL;DR: A novel AI method for lung infection severity prediction from CT scans and chest X-rays using Transformer architecture with cross-gated attention and custom data augmentation to handle dataset imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung infections like pneumonia pose serious health risks that require timely clinical decisions. Accurate AI-based severity prediction from medical imaging is essential to optimize patient outcomes, especially during pandemics.

Method: Proposes QCross-Att-PVT (Transformer-based architecture with parallel encoders, cross-gated attention, and feature aggregator) and Conditional Online TransMix (custom data augmentation strategy for handling dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image patches).

Result: Outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models on two benchmark datasets (RALO CXR and Per-COVID-19 CT), demonstrating improved robustness and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool for clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning, emphasizing the importance of data augmentation and gated attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical
diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning. The source

### [60] [Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual exemplar learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06926)
*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel active learning approach for change detection that selects the most critical unlabeled samples (virtual exemplars) using an invertible graph convnet to improve label efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods heavily depend on hand-labeled training data, which is costly and subjective. The paper aims to reduce labeling effort through active learning.

Method: Uses an invertible graph convnet to generate virtual exemplars by optimizing an adversarial loss that considers representativity, diversity, and ambiguity to challenge current change detection criteria.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the positive impact of the label-efficient learning model compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning framework effectively reduces labeling requirements while maintaining change detection performance by focusing on the most informative samples.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

### [61] [IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928)
*Ran Yi,Teng Hu,Zihan Su,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAR2 is an advanced autoregressive framework that improves image generation through hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis using a dual codebook system and progressive conditional guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous autoregressive models that overlook structural properties of visual data, and to address constraints of rigid pre-trained codebooks and inaccurate hard clustering in the prior IAR approach.

Method: Uses Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook to decouple image representations into semantic and detail components, Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme with Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head, and Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG for conditional generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with FID of 1.50 on ImageNet, surpassing previous methods while demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IAR2's structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy effectively enhances autoregressive image generation through hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis and adaptive conditional guidance.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

*Bing Li,Wuqi Wang,Yanan Zhang,Jingzheng Li,Haigen Min,Wei Feng,Xingyu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-3D adversarial generation method (Phy3DAdvGen) that creates physically realizable 3D pedestrians invisible to LiDAR detectors by optimizing text prompts and constraining generation to real object combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D adversarial attacks rarely cause complete object disappearance and are difficult to implement physically. There's a need for effective attacks to test LiDAR-based 3D object detectors in autonomous driving for safety.

Method: Systematically investigate detection vulnerability factors through topology, connectivity, and intensity manipulation. Propose Phy3DAdvGen that iteratively refines text prompts (verbs, objects, poses) and constrains generation to combinations of 13 real 3D objects for physical realizability.

Result: Generated 3D pedestrians successfully evade six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively exposes vulnerabilities in safety-critical LiDAR detection systems and enables physically realizable adversarial attacks.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

*Huanning Dong,Fan Li,Ping Kuang,Jianwen Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectGaussian is a novel Text-to-3D method that generates 3D object surfaces using surfels with 2D Gaussian splatting, incorporating multi-view normal/texture priors and curvature constraints for geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-3D methods struggle with complex geometric shapes in natural objects - either using 2D diffusion priors or training on specific 3D representations, which limits their effectiveness in generating realistic 3D content.

Method: Uses surfels to represent 3D object surfaces, employs conditional text generation models with 2D Gaussian splatting for rendering, incorporates multi-view normal and texture priors, and adds curvature constraints during optimization for geometric consistency.

Result: The framework achieves diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian provides an effective approach for Text-to-3D modeling that handles complex geometric shapes while maintaining multi-view consistency through surface-based representation and curvature constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

*Shoumeng Qiu,Xinrun Li,Yang Long,Xiangyang Xue,Varun Ojha,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapGR introduces global representation learning for HD map construction, addressing limitations of local query perspectives in DETR-based methods through synergistic modules for global alignment and contextual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based HD map construction methods rely on independent object queries with local perspectives, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps.

Method: Proposes MapGR with two modules: Global Representation Learning (GRL) that aligns query distribution with global map via holistic segmentation, and Global Representation Guidance (GRG) that provides explicit global-level contextual information to individual queries.

Result: Substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: Learning and utilizing global representations from queries significantly enhances HD map construction performance.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RICE is a novel video captioning method that leverages LVLMs' inherent ID-Matching capabilities to improve identity tracking in long videos, achieving significant improvements in precision (50% to 90%) and recall (15% to 80%) for ID-Matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video captioning faces the ID-Matching problem - accurately recognizing same individuals across different frames. Previous approaches have limited generalization and use point-wise matching, which limits effectiveness.

Method: Built upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. Proposed RICE method that improves ID-Matching through: 1) enhancing image information usage, and 2) increasing quantity of individual descriptions. Created a new benchmark for assessing ID-Matching capabilities.

Result: RICE significantly improves ID-Matching performance on GPT-4o: precision increased from 50% to 90%, recall increased from 15% to 80%. Enables continuous tracking of different individuals in long video captions.

Conclusion: The proposed RICE method successfully unlocks LVLMs' inherent ID-Matching capabilities, making continuous identity tracking in long video captions possible and demonstrating superior performance in both caption quality and ID-Matching.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

TL;DR: A Reinforcement Learning-based post-training framework that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without requiring motion ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for human motion generation require costly retraining with additional motion capture data to adapt to unseen actions or styles, which is difficult to scale.

Method: Uses a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as reward signal and optimizes diffusion policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, shifting the generative distribution toward target domains without paired motion data.

Result: Consistently improves quality and diversity of generated motions in cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, while preserving original distribution performance.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation that works with both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve temporal consistency in yearly land-cover maps for better modeling of land cover evolution and change over time.

Method: Uses HMMs integrated with Transformer Encoder-based DNNs to capture temporal correlations in yearly satellite image time series and multiyear crop type patterns.

Result: Validation on 47 crop types over 6 years shows HMMs enhance overall performance and F1 scores, demonstrating importance of temporal consistency modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves temporal consistency in land-cover classification through combined deep learning and Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

TL;DR: U-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities, introducing U-Score metric and model selection guidance for medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite U-Net's dominance in medical image segmentation, there has been no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate performance and utility due to insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization.

Method: U-Bench evaluates models along three dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. It introduces U-Score metric and provides systematic analysis of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms.

Result: The benchmark exposes gaps in previous evaluations and provides a foundation for fair, reproducible benchmarking. It offers model selection guidance and makes all code, models, protocols, and weights publicly available.

Conclusion: U-Bench establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models, enabling better model selection and evaluation standards.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for retrieving images that share central concepts rather than just visual or semantic similarity, using bimodal Gaussian distribution modeling of embedding neighborhoods to identify underlying narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond conventional image retrieval methods by capturing the central concepts and underlying narrative of images, rather than just visual or semantic similarity.

Method: Proposes a novel approach based on two key observations: (1) neighbors in embedding space share at least one concept with query but not necessarily with each other, (2) modeling neighborhood with bimodal Gaussian distribution reveals meaningful structure for concept identification.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method successfully retrieves images sharing central concepts and captures underlying narratives, outperforming conventional retrieval methods that focus only on visual or semantic similarity.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

TL;DR: DADO is a novel self-supervised model that combines attention mechanisms and depth models for unsupervised object discovery, using dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize features based on image characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery remains a significant challenge in computer vision, as it requires identifying and localizing objects in images without human-annotated labels.

Method: DADO combines attention mechanism and depth model with dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on global image characteristics, addressing challenges like noisy attention maps and complex scenes with varying depth planes.

Result: DADO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks in object discovery accuracy and robustness without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed DADO model effectively addresses unsupervised object discovery challenges by combining attention and depth features with adaptive weighting, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

*Rémi Kazmierczak,Steve Azzolin,Eloïse Berthier,Goran Frehse,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies concept hallucination in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models and proposes CHILI to mitigate this issue by localizing concepts in images for more faithful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of concept hallucination in CLIP-based explainable AI systems, where CLIP incorrectly predicts concept presence/absence, undermining explanation faithfulness.

Method: Introduces CHILI (Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability), which disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts to reduce hallucination.

Result: The approach successfully mitigates concept hallucination and supports generation of more interpretable saliency-based explanations.

Conclusion: CHILI provides an effective solution to improve faithfulness in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models by localizing concepts and reducing hallucination issues.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

### [72] [MoRe: Monocular Geometry Refinement via Graph Optimization for Cross-View Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07119)
*Dongki Jung,Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRe is a training-free monocular geometry refinement method that improves cross-view consistency and scale alignment in 3D vision using graph-based optimization with feature matching and local planar approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D foundation models provide extensible solutions for perception tasks but suffer from scale ambiguity and cross-view inconsistency, limiting their broader applications in 3D vision.

Method: The method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences, then uses a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using estimated 3D points and surface normals from monocular foundation models.

Result: MoRe enhances both 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, particularly improving performance in sparse view rendering scenarios by addressing scale ambiguity while preserving underlying 3D structure.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free refinement method effectively improves geometric consistency and scale alignment in monocular 3D vision applications without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

### [73] [Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07126)
*Jan Fiszer,Dominika Ciupek,Maciej Malawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning shows resilience to non-IID MRI data caused by different intensity normalization methods, achieving 92% Dice score for brain tumor segmentation comparable to centralized training while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in medical imaging faces challenges with data privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning addresses these but may be affected by non-IID data distribution, particularly from different MRI intensity normalization methods.

Method: Simulated non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets for brain tumor segmentation. Trained and tested models using federated learning approach.

Result: FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data, achieving 92% 3D Dice score comparable to centralized model performance.

Conclusion: Federated learning is an effective solution for training high-performing medical imaging models without violating data privacy, even with heterogeneous data from different normalization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

*Sarah Cechnicka,Matthew Baugh,Weitong Zhang,Mischa Dombrowski,Zhe Li,Johannes C. Paetzold,Candice Roufosse,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion using graph-based object-level representations to enable fine-grained control in medical image generation, particularly for histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) operate in noisy latent spaces lacking semantic structure, making controlled generation challenging in sensitive medical imaging where structural consistency is critical for diagnosis.

Method: Uses graph-based object-level representations where nodes correspond to major structures in images, processed by transformer modules and integrated into diffusion models via text-conditioning mechanisms.

Result: The approach successfully generates medical images that can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks for histopathology use cases.

Conclusion: Graph-conditioned diffusion provides effective fine-grained control over medical image generation while maintaining structural integrity critical for diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

### [75] [Few-Shot Adaptation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07135)
*Karim El Khoury,Maxime Zanella,Christophe De Vleeschouwer,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs), revealing that models with similar zero-shot performance can behave very differently under few-shot conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RSVLMs show strong zero-shot performance, their generalization in low-data regimes like few-shot learning remains insufficiently explored, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets using five few-shot adaptation strategies on three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones.

Result: Models with similar zero-shot performance exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. No clear winner among existing methods was found.

Conclusion: There is a need for developing more robust few-shot adaptation methods specifically tailored to remote sensing, and the authors provide a reproducible benchmarking framework to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

### [76] [Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07143)
*Chenfei Liao,Wensong Wang,Zichen Wen,Xu Zheng,Yiyu Wang,Haocong He,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Lutao Jiang,Xin Zou,Yuqian Fu,Bin Ren,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for evaluating visual token compression in MLLMs suffer from task mismatch, and simple image downsampling often outperforms advanced methods. The authors propose VTC-Bench with data filtering to enable fairer evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks designed for MLLM perception/reasoning assessment are unsuitable for evaluating visual token compression methods, creating a task mismatch that leads to inaccurate comparisons.

Method: Extensive experiments showing image downsampling outperforms advanced compression methods, leading to the development of VTC-Bench - an evaluation framework with data filtering to denoise existing benchmarks.

Result: Found that current benchmarks are noisy for visual token compression tasks, and downsampling can serve as a data filter to evaluate sample difficulty. Simple downsampling consistently beats sophisticated compression methods.

Conclusion: VTC-Bench provides a fairer assessment framework for visual token compression methods by incorporating data filtering to address the task mismatch issue in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

*Yihao Zhi,Chenghong Li,Hongjie Liao,Xihe Yang,Zhengwentai Sun,Jiahao Chang,Xiaodong Cun,Wensen Feng,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-Performer is a framework for generating synchronized 360-degree novel view videos from monocular human captures using camera-dependent normal maps and multi-view video diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with 360-degree viewpoint changes and primarily focus on front-view camera trajectory redirection, limiting their application in human-centric scenarios.

Method: Uses MVHumanNet dataset with camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds, and a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints information.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness in human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: MV-Performer sets a strong benchmark for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis with robust inference for in-the-wild videos.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

### [78] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 SSL model with 512x512 resolution and ConvNeXt-B backbone provides optimal performance for chest radiography, outperforming DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization, with greatest benefits for detecting subtle abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether DINOv3's SSL improvements translate to better performance in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across 7 datasets (n>814,000) using ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B backbones at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 resolutions, plus frozen features from 7B model.

Result: At 512x512 resolution, DINOv3 consistently outperformed DINOv2 and ImageNet. ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16 across all settings. Scaling to 1024x1024 provided no further gains. Resolution benefits were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities.

Conclusion: 512x512 resolution with DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provides optimal chest radiograph interpretation, with greatest gains for detecting subtle lesions in emergency and critical care settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore is a new OOD detection method that uses the eigenvalue spectrum of diffusion model posterior covariance to detect distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness in near-OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is critical for safe ML deployment in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have shown promise for OOD detection, but existing methods often fail in near-OOD scenarios.

Method: Leverages the eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance from diffusion models, using a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate leading eigenvalues with only forward evaluations of the denoiser.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 5% AUROC improvement over best baselines. Notably robust in near-OOD settings like CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 where existing diffusion-based methods often fail.

Conclusion: Posterior covariance provides a consistent signal for distribution shift, and EigenScore effectively leverages this spectral signature for reliable OOD detection with improved robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

TL;DR: GenPilot is a plug-and-play multi-agent system for test-time prompt optimization that improves text-to-image synthesis by analyzing errors, exploring alternatives, and iteratively refining prompts to enhance semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex and lengthy prompts, leading to semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Current solutions like fine-tuning are model-specific and require training, while automatic prompt optimization approaches lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies.

Method: Proposed GenPilot system with multi-agent architecture including error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and memory module for iterative optimization. It operates directly on input text and is model-agnostic.

Result: Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval show improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% in text-image consistency and structural coherence. The approach effectively handles long and complex prompts.

Conclusion: GenPilot provides a flexible, efficient, and interpretable test-time prompt optimization strategy that enhances text-to-image generation quality while being model-agnostic and suitable for complex prompts.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, lacking diversity in camera angles and multi-shot scenarios needed for realistic speech video generation.

Method: Created TalkCuts dataset with 164k clips, detailed annotations, and introduced Orator framework using LLM as director to orchestrate camera transitions, gestures, and vocal modulation through integrated multi-modal generation.

Result: Training on TalkCuts significantly improves cinematographic coherence and visual appeal in both pose-guided and audio-driven multi-shot speech video generation.

Conclusion: TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for controllable multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning, addressing limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (RETFound, FLAIR) don't consistently outperform fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 for Diabetic Macular Edema detection, suggesting lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DME causes vision loss in diabetic patients, but deep learning faces data scarcity challenges. Foundation Models offer an alternative, but their effectiveness for fine-grained DME detection is unclear.

Method: Systematic comparison of FM (RETFound, FLAIR) vs EfficientNet-B0 across different training regimes and evaluation settings using IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images datasets.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in most settings for ROC/PR curves. RETFound showed promise only in OEFI. FLAIR demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance with appropriate prompting.

Conclusion: Foundation Models may not be suitable for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection even after fine-tuning, with lightweight CNNs remaining strong baselines in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard is a robust invisible image watermarking method that embeds messages in hidden convolution layers using spectral projection in the frequency domain, achieving superior performance against various attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods lack robustness against transformations like distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbations, creating real-world challenges for authenticity verification.

Method: Embed messages in hidden convolution layers by converting spatial domain to frequency domain using spectral projection with wavelet decomposition. Uses Fast Fourier Transform approximation and strength factor for resilience against attacks. Decoder leverages Parseval's theorem for watermark extraction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SpecGuard outperforms state-of-the-art models in watermark invisibility, capacity, and robustness against diverse attacks including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions.

Conclusion: SpecGuard provides an effective solution for robust and invisible image watermarking, with code released on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how video diffusion transformers (DiTs) represent interactions, introduces MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions, proposes MATRIX regularization to improve interaction modeling, and creates InterGenEval evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video DiTs struggle to model multi-instance or subject-object interactions, raising questions about how these models internally represent interactions.

Method: Curated MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Analyzed semantic grounding (video-to-text attention) and semantic propagation (video-to-video attention). Introduced MATRIX regularization to align attention with multi-instance mask tracks.

Result: Found interaction effects concentrate in a small subset of layers. MATRIX improves interaction fidelity, semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination.

Conclusion: MATRIX regularization effectively enhances video DiTs' ability to model interactions through targeted attention alignment in specific layers.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

### [85] [WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313)
*Zezhong Qian,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Shizun Wang,Zhiyuan Qin,Xiaozhu Ju,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WristWorld is a 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos from anchor views alone, bridging the gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views in manipulation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation performance, but large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, creating a substantial gap between anchor views and wrist views.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Reconstruction stage extends VGGT with Spatial Projection Consistency Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (2) Generation stage uses video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda datasets. Improves VLA performance by raising average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld successfully bridges the anchor-wrist view gap by generating wrist-view videos from anchor views alone, enhancing manipulation performance in VLA models through better hand-object interaction modeling.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

### [86] [Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07316)
*Gangwei Xu,Haotong Lin,Hongcheng Luo,Xianqi Wang,Jingfeng Yao,Lianghui Zhu,Yuechuan Pu,Cheng Chi,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye,Sida Peng,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel-Perfect Depth is a monocular depth estimation model using pixel-space diffusion generation to produce high-quality, flying-pixel-free depth maps and point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative depth estimation models using Stable Diffusion require VAE compression which introduces flying pixels at edges and details, degrading quality.

Method: Uses pixel-space diffusion generation with two key designs: Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) that incorporate semantic representations to preserve global consistency, and Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases tokens for efficiency.

Result: Achieves best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Conclusion: Pixel-space diffusion generation with semantic prompting and cascade design effectively eliminates flying pixels and produces superior depth estimation quality compared to latent-space approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Method: The survey reviews QeCV methodologies compatible with quantum hardware, covering two main quantum computational paradigms: gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. It also elaborates on operational principles of quantum computers and available tools.

Result: A comprehensive introduction to QeCV that serves as a quantum computing reference for the computer vision community, covering specifics, methodologies, tools, and learning materials.

Conclusion: QeCV has high potential to transform visual signal processing, but requires development of specialized quantum algorithms and faces open challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Tenet, a framework that decomposes RVOS into referring, video, and segmentation factors, using temporal prompts and prompt preference learning to adapt image-based foundation models for efficient video object segmentation without dense mask annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which is computation-consuming and less scalable. The authors aim to investigate the key to this task and enable efficient adaptation of foundation models.

Method: Decompose RVOS into three factors, use object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts, propose Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate prompt quality, and leverage image-based foundation segmentation models for mask generation.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework in producing high-quality masks for referred objects.

Conclusion: The Tenet framework enables efficient adaptation of foundation segmentation models to RVOS by addressing referring and video factors through temporal prompts and preference learning, achieving competitive performance without dense annotation requirements.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

*Mehdi Rabiee,Sergio Greco,Reza Shahbazian,Irina Trubitsyna*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A new framework for segmenting Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) in 3D brain MRI using transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with a novel loss function combining Dice loss and anisotropic Total Variation to improve segmentation accuracy and reduce false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCD is difficult to detect in MRI due to subtle lesions, limited annotated datasets, small lesion size, weak contrast, and the need for smooth, anatomically consistent outputs that standard loss functions don't address.

Method: Transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with a novel loss function combining Dice loss and anisotropic Total Variation term to encourage spatial smoothness and reduce false positive clusters without post-processing.

Result: 11.9% improvement in Dice coefficient, 13.3% higher precision over baseline, and 61.6% reduction in false positive clusters on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with TV loss demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency for FCD detection in 3D brain MRI, addressing key challenges in this medical imaging task.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy
and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to
the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD
regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical
planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to
the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size
and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal
inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is
often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents
a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt
state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and
introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total
Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and
reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The
framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and
demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to
standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\%
improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the
baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by
61.6%

*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SER-Diff is a novel framework that combines diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning for brain tumor segmentation, using synthetic error replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting without requiring generative replay or auxiliary storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in incremental brain tumor segmentation models, which lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new clinical data without retraining on all prior data.

Method: Uses a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, replayed during new task training. Employs dual-loss formulation with Dice loss for new data and knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on BraTS datasets with highest Dice scores (95.8%, 94.9%, 94.6%) and lowest HD95 values (4.4mm, 4.7mm, 4.9mm) across BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023.

Conclusion: SER-Diff effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while delivering more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets, demonstrating the successful unification of diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning.

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt
to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However,
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge,
remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge
distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative
replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective
for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental
learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the
first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental
learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate
synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new
tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge
distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.
Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff
consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of
95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7
mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only
mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and
anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction for accelerated MRI reconstruction, embedding measurement models directly into reverse diffusion steps and using paired supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition time is a critical limitation in clinical scenarios. Undersampling accelerates acquisition but causes artifacts. Existing diffusion models either lack paired supervision or apply data consistency only as post-processing.

Method: Conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction that embeds MRI measurement model directly into every reverse diffusion step, trained on paired undersampled-ground truth data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion methods on fastMRI dataset in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully.

Conclusion: Integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism for robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical
diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation,
especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies
can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and
degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing
high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors;
however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score
functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a
post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising
diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs
from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every
reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground
truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit
enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that
our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning
and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing
perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that
integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields
substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism,
establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI
reconstruction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents an end-to-end deep neural network that generates patient-specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D CT images to overcome labor-intensive manual segmentation barriers in thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a leading cause of death in adults, and current patient-specific anatomical modeling relies on manual segmentation which is time-consuming and difficult to scale for large patient populations, limiting clinical adoption of computational biomechanical risk assessment tools.

Method: The authors developed an end-to-end deep neural network that directly generates patient-specific finite element meshes of the aorta from 3D CT images, building on their previous work with PyTorch FEA library and FEA-DNN integration framework that reduced computation times significantly.

Result: The approach successfully overcomes the first major barrier (labor-intensive 3D reconstruction) by automating mesh generation, complementing their previous achievement of reducing FEA-based stress computation from resource-intensive traditional methods to just a few seconds per case.

Conclusion: This work enables scalable, automated patient-specific thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture risk assessment by eliminating manual segmentation barriers, making computational biomechanical analysis clinically feasible for large patient populations.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in
the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal
bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.
From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on
the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be
obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite
Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be
calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure
model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture
risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited
due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient
specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it
time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and
computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and
incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was
successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA
library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA
functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static
determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately
three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the
PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to
only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier
through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of
generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D
CT images.

*Duncan Stothers,Sophia Xu,Carlie Reeves,Lia Gracey*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fitzpatrick thresholding to improve psoriasis segmentation performance across different skin tones, particularly for darker skin types, without requiring model retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current psoriasis segmentation models perform significantly worse on darker skin tones, which can lead to inequitable healthcare outcomes. Accurate BSA estimation is crucial for treatment assessment and selection.

Method: Used a psoriasis dataset from six public atlases with Fitzpatrick skin type annotations and segmentation masks. Trained U-Net, ResU-Net, and SETR-small models without tone information, then applied Fitzpatrick-specific decision thresholds selected from tuning split optima.

Result: Fitzpatrick thresholding improved segmentation for darkest skin (Fitz VI) by up to +31% bIoU and +24% Dice on U-Net, with consistent gains for other models (+25% bIoU on ResU-Net, +17% bIoU on SETR-small).

Conclusion: Fitzpatrick thresholding is a simple, model-agnostic approach that dramatically improves segmentation fairness across skin tones without retraining costs, making it a viable fairness baseline for medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the body surface area (BSA) involved by a rash, such
as psoriasis, is critical for assessing rash severity, selecting an initial
treatment regimen, and following clinical treatment response. Attempts at
segmentation of inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis perform markedly
worse on darker skin tones, potentially impeding equitable care. We assembled a
psoriasis dataset sourced from six public atlases, annotated for Fitzpatrick
skin type, and added detailed segmentation masks for every image. Reference
models based on U-Net, ResU-Net, and SETR-small are trained without tone
information. On the tuning split we sweep decision thresholds and select (i)
global optima and (ii) per Fitzpatrick skin tone optima for Dice and binary
IoU. Adapting Fitzpatrick specific thresholds lifted segmentation performance
for the darkest subgroup (Fitz VI) by up to +31 % bIoU and +24 % Dice on UNet,
with consistent, though smaller, gains in the same direction for ResU-Net (+25
% bIoU, +18 % Dice) and SETR-small (+17 % bIoU, +11 % Dice). Because
Fitzpatrick skin tone classifiers trained on Fitzpatrick-17k now exceed 95 %
accuracy, the cost of skin tone labeling required for this technique has fallen
dramatically. Fitzpatrick thresholding is simple, model-agnostic, requires no
architectural changes, no re-training, and is virtually cost free. We
demonstrate the inclusion of Fitzpatrick thresholding as a potential future
fairness baseline.

### [95] [Content-Adaptive Inference for State-of-the-art Learned Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07283)
*Ahmet Bilican,M. Akın Yılmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed a model-agnostic framework to improve learned video codec performance on videos with complex motions by adaptively downsampling frames to match training motion vector ranges, achieving up to 41% BD-rate improvement on individual videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned video codecs perform well on average but struggle with videos containing complex/large motions due to inability to generalize to unseen motion vector ranges, causing performance degradation in flow estimation and compression.

Method: A generic framework that controls motion vector scale during inference by adaptively downsampling frames to match test and training video motion vector ranges, enabling better flow estimation and more efficient flow compression.

Result: The framework improved BD-rate performance of state-of-the-art low-delay video codec DCVC-FM by up to 41% on individual videos without model fine-tuning. Ablation studies showed motion and scene complexity measures can predict framework effectiveness.

Conclusion: Content-adaptive inference through frame downsampling effectively addresses learned video codec limitations with complex motions, providing significant performance improvements without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: While the BD-rate performance of recent learned video codec models in both
low-delay and random-access modes exceed that of respective modes of
traditional codecs on average over common benchmarks, the performance
improvements for individual videos with complex/large motions is much smaller
compared to scenes with simple motion. This is related to the inability of a
learned encoder model to generalize to motion vector ranges that have not been
seen in the training set, which causes loss of performance in both coding of
flow fields as well as frame prediction and coding. As a remedy, we propose a
generic (model-agnostic) framework to control the scale of motion vectors in a
scene during inference (encoding) to approximately match the range of motion
vectors in the test and training videos by adaptively downsampling frames. This
results in down-scaled motion vectors enabling: i) better flow estimation;
hence, frame prediction and ii) more efficient flow compression. We show that
the proposed framework for content-adaptive inference improves the BD-rate
performance of already state-of-the-art low-delay video codec DCVC-FM by up to
41\% on individual videos without any model fine tuning. We present ablation
studies to show measures of motion and scene complexity can be used to predict
the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [96] [A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06342)
*Ludovico Lami*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: General Chernoff-Stein lemma for composite hypotheses with genuine correlations, extending beyond i.i.d. settings to correlated distributions with convexity and weak permutational symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize hypothesis testing theory beyond simple i.i.d. cases to composite hypotheses with genuine correlations, overcoming limitations of prior work that mostly handled convex combinations of product distributions.

Method: Refined blurring technique applied symbol by symbol, building on generalized quantum Stein's lemma approach, enabling analysis without requiring full permutational symmetry.

Result: Established general Chernoff-Stein lemma that strictly subsumes most prior work, applicable to composite correlated hypotheses with convexity and weak symmetry conditions.

Conclusion: Provides unified framework for hypothesis testing with correlated composite hypotheses, with applications to discrimination problems and constrained de Finetti reductions, extending to quantum settings.

Abstract: Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating
between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task
in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent,
i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a
vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and
i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative
entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of
this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings
where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but
rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components
taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that
applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely
correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both
hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either
hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved
using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the
generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this
refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both
stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The
second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter
formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad
families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying
alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction'
statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to
quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].

### [97] [$α$-leakage Interpretation of Rényi Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06622)
*Ni Ding,Farhad Farokhi,Tao Guo,Yinfei Xu,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper provides new interpretations of Sibson mutual information as α-leakage averaged over adversary's relative information gain, proposes Y-elementary α-leakage extending pointwise maximal leakage, and connects Rényi capacity to maximal information leakage with alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and interpret information leakage measures, particularly Sibson mutual information and Rényi capacity, in the context of privacy and security against adversarial inference.

Method: Mathematical analysis showing Sibson mutual information as averaged α-leakage, proposal of Y-elementary α-leakage concept, derivation of sufficient conditions for δ-approximation, and interpretation of Rényi capacity as maximal information leakage.

Result: Established connections between Sibson mutual information and α-leakage, extended pointwise maximal leakage to full Rényi order range, showed Rényi divergence emerges from maximizing Y-elementary leakage, and proposed alternating max-max implementation for Blahut-Arimoto method.

Conclusion: The paper provides novel interpretations of information-theoretic leakage measures that connect Sibson mutual information, Rényi divergence, and Rényi capacity to adversarial inference scenarios, offering new computational approaches for privacy analysis.

Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper shows that
the Sibson mutual information is an $\alpha$-leakage averaged over the
adversary's $\tilde{f}$-mean relative information gain (on the secret) at
elementary event of channel output $Y$ as well as the joint occurrence of
elementary channel input $X$ and output $Y$. This interpretation is used to
derive a sufficient condition that achieves a $\delta$-approximation of
$\epsilon$-upper bounded $\alpha$-leakage. A $Y$-elementary $\alpha$-leakage is
proposed, extending the existing pointwise maximal leakage to the overall
R\'{e}nyi order range $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$. Maximizing this $Y$-elementary
leakage over all attributes $U$ of channel input $X$ gives the R\'{e}nyi
divergence. Further, the R\'{e}nyi capacity is interpreted as the maximal
$\tilde{f}$-mean information leakage over both the adversary's malicious
inference decision and the channel input $X$ (represents the adversary's prior
belief). This suggests an alternating max-max implementation of the existing
generalized Blahut-Arimoto method.

*Fabian Göttsch,Max Franke,Arash Pourdamghani,Giuseppe Caire,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Analysis of spectral efficiency and fronthaul load in scalable user-centric cell-free massive MIMO systems with optimized quantization and routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between PHY spectral efficiency and fronthaul network load in cell-free massive MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity.

Method: Joint optimization of cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing using mixed-integer linear programming, with quantization based on rate-distortion theory.

Result: Optimized quantization rates maintain stable fronthaul load across varying user densities without significant PHY performance degradation.

Conclusion: Cell-free massive MIMO systems demonstrate resilience to varying user densities through proper quantization and network optimization.

Abstract: We investigate the physical layer (PHY) spectral efficiency and fronthaul
network load of a scalable user-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Each
user-centric cluster processor responsible for cluster-level signal processing
is located at one of multiple decentralized units (DUs). Thus, the radio units
in the cluster must exchange data with the corresponding DU over the fronthaul.
Because the fronthaul links have limited capacity, this data must be quantized
before it is sent over the fronthaul. We consider a routed fronthaul network,
where the cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing are jointly
optimized with a mixed-integer linear program. For different numbers of users
in the network, we investigate the effect of fronthaul quantization rates, a
system parameter computed based on rate-distortion theory. Our results show
that with optimized quantization rates, the fronthaul load is quite stable for
a wide range of user loads without significant PHY performance loss. This
demonstrates that the cell-free massive MIMO PHY and fronthaul network are
resilient to varying user densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance security and perceptual reconstruction quality in multi-hop AWGN channels by semantically clustering images through deep hash distillation.

Method: Train DeepJSCC encoder-decoder with pre-trained DHD module to minimize both MSE and cosine distance between source and reconstructed image hashes.

Result: Significantly improved perceptual quality and semantic alignment across multi-hop settings, reducing noise accumulation issues in classical DeepJSCC.

Conclusion: DeepJSCC with DHD effectively enhances semantic consistency and perceptual reconstruction for secure image transmission over multi-hop channels.

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding
(DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by
training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash
distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating
security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and
improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module
to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD
hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual
quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different
multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise
accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)
metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing studies on pinching-antenna technique focus on single-cell scenarios and ignore interference from spatially distributed base stations, creating a knowledge gap for multi-cell systems.

Method: Applied stochastic geometry tools for system modeling of multi-cell pinching-antenna systems with spatially distributed waveguides connected to different base stations.

Result: Derived the expression for outage probability and verified analytical accuracy through simulations, showing superior performance compared to fixed-antenna systems.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical framework successfully evaluates multi-cell pinching-antenna system performance and demonstrates its advantages over conventional fixed-antenna systems.

Abstract: Recently, the study on pinching-antenna technique has attracted significant
attention. However, most relevant literature focuses on a single-cell scenario,
where the effect from the interfering pinching-antennas on waveguides connected
to spatially distributed base stations (BSs) was ignored. To fulfill this
knowledge gap, this letter aims to provide an analytical framework on
performance evaluation for multi-cell pinching-antenna systems where spatially
distributed waveguides which are connected to different BSs are considered. In
particular, tools from stochastic geometry is applied for system modeling. The
expression for the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results are
provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the superior
performance of pinching-antenna system compared to fixed-antenna systems.

Motivation: The digital world generates massive amounts of data that require efficient management, transmission, and storage. Time series data compression is crucial for resource preservation and scalability, but the vast landscape of techniques needs systematic comparison.

Conclusion: Well-configured and complete compression pipelines are crucial. The study provides a comprehensive guide for selecting and composing appropriate compression algorithms tailored to specific datasets.

Abstract: Our increasingly digital and connected world has led to the generation of

### [102] [Robustness of Covariance Estimators with Application in Activity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07044)
*Hendrik Bernd Zarucha,Peter Jung,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper presents a general class of robust covariance estimators and applies them to activity detection in random access systems with multiple antennas, achieving recovery guarantees under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust covariance estimation methods that can handle perturbations and apply them to solve sparse recovery problems in wireless communication systems, particularly for activity detection with multiple receive antennas.

Method: Proposes a general class of covariance estimators using real-valued functions g and model covariance matrices H. The estimator minimizes the sum of g applied to eigenvalues of transformed covariance matrices. Applies this to activity detection by reducing sparse recovery to structured covariance estimation, using non-negative least squares or relaxed maximum likelihood estimators.

Result: Shows that under mild conditions, the covariance estimators are robust (estimation error can be made arbitrarily small with small perturbations). For activity detection, proves that with proposed codebooks based on signed kernel condition, both estimators can recover large-scale fading coefficients when number of antennas is high enough and S ≤ ⌈½M²⌉ - 1.

Conclusion: The general class of covariance estimators provides robust estimation, and when applied to activity detection in wireless systems, enables reliable recovery of large-scale fading coefficients under specific conditions on system parameters.

Abstract: The first part of this work considers a general class of covariance
estimators. Each estimator of that class is generated by a real-valued function
$g$ and a set of model covariance matrices $H$. If $\bf{W}$ is a potentially
perturbed observation of a searched covariance matrix, then the estimator is
the minimizer of the sum of $g$ applied to each eigenvalue of
$\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}\bf{Z}^{-1}\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}$ under the constraint that
$\bf{Z}$ is from $H$. It is shown that under mild conditions on $g$ and $H$
such estimators are robust, meaning the estimation error can be made
arbitrarily small if the perturbation of $\bf{W}$ gets small enough. \par In
the second part of this work the previous results are applied to activity
detection in random access with multiple receive antennas. In activity
detection recovering the large scale fading coefficients is a sparse recovery
problem which can be reduced to a structured covariance estimation problem. The
recovery can be done with a non-negative least squares estimator or with a
relaxed maximum likelihood estimator. It is shown that under suitable
assumptions on the distributions of the noise and the channel coefficients, the
relaxed maximum likelihood estimator is from the general class of covariance
estimators considered in the first part of this work. Then, codebooks based
upon a signed kernel condition are proposed. It is shown that with the proposed
codebooks both estimators can recover the large-scale fading coefficients if
the number of receive antennas is high enough and
$S\leq\left\lceil\frac{1}{2}M^2\right\rceil-1$ where $S$ is the number of
active users and $M$ is number of pilot symbols per user.

*Lingyi Wang,Rashed Shelim,Walid Saad,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A theoretically-grounded codebook design for digital semantic communications that optimizes quantization efficiency, transmission efficiency, and robust performance through mutual information maximization and channel-aware semantic distortion mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between vector-based high-dimensional semantic features and discrete symbol representations required in digital communication systems, providing an efficient mapping through learnable codebooks.

Method: Established equivalence between semantic synonymous mapping and codebook Voronoi partitions, derived mutual information between features and quantized indices, introduced entropy-regularized quantization loss for training, and proposed channel-aware semantic distortion loss to mitigate physical channel noise effects.

Result: Achieved 24.1% improvement in PSNR and 46.5% improvement in LPIPS compared to existing codebook designs at 10 dB SNR in image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed theoretically-grounded codebook design effectively optimizes semantic information transmission while mitigating channel-induced distortions, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: The use of a learnable codebook provides an efficient way for semantic
communications to map vector-based high-dimensional semantic features onto
discrete symbol representations required in digital communication systems. In
this paper, the problem of codebook-enabled quantization mapping for digital
semantic communications is studied from the perspective of information theory.
Particularly, a novel theoretically-grounded codebook design is proposed for
jointly optimizing quantization efficiency, transmission efficiency, and robust
performance. First, a formal equivalence is established between the one-to-many
synonymous mapping defined in semantic information theory and the many-to-one
quantization mapping based on the codebook's Voronoi partitions. Then, the
mutual information between semantic features and their quantized indices is
derived in order to maximize semantic information carried by discrete indices.
To realize the semantic maximum in practice, an entropy-regularized
quantization loss based on empirical estimation is introduced for end-to-end
codebook training. Next, the physical channel-induced semantic distortion and
the optimal codebook size for semantic communications are characterized under
bit-flip errors and semantic distortion. To mitigate the semantic distortion
caused by physical channel noise, a novel channel-aware semantic distortion
loss is proposed. Simulation results on image reconstruction tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed theoretically-grounded codebook that
achieves a 24.1% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 46.5%
improvement in learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) compared to
the existing codebook designs when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper presents three edge differentially private mechanisms for spectral graph clustering: graph perturbation with edge flipping and shuffling, private graph projection with Gaussian noise, and noisy power iteration. These methods provide rigorous privacy guarantees while preserving spectral properties and enabling accurate clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable spectral graph clustering while protecting edge-level privacy through differential privacy mechanisms, addressing the challenge of maintaining utility while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Method: Three main approaches: (1) graph perturbation via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, (2) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in lower-dimensional space, and (3) noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across iterations.

Result: The mechanisms provide rigorous edge differential privacy guarantees, with shuffling amplifying privacy protection. Theoretical analysis characterizes misclassification error rates, and experiments on synthetic and real-world networks validate the privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully enable edge differentially private spectral graph clustering while maintaining practical utility, with shuffling playing a crucial role in enhancing privacy guarantees as graph size increases.

Abstract: We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential
privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation
via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which
enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph.
Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping
edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP
guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves
(epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of
nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a
lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity;
and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across
iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis
provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the
misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks
validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility
trade-offs.

*Khartik Uppalapati,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareGraph-Synth is a knowledge-guided diffusion framework that generates privacy-preserving synthetic EHR trajectories for ultra-rare diseases using a heterogeneous knowledge graph with 8M edges to guide generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safer data sharing for rare-disease research by generating realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records that protect patient privacy while maintaining data utility.

Method: Unifies five biomedical resources into a heterogeneous knowledge graph with 8M edges, uses meta-path scores to modulate noise schedules in continuous-time diffusion models, and generates timestamped sequences of lab-medication-adverse-event triples without protected health information.

Result: Reduces categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40% vs unguided diffusion and >60% vs GANs, achieves AUROC of ~0.53 in membership-inference attacks (below 0.55 safe threshold), and maintains downstream predictive utility.

Conclusion: Integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance data fidelity and privacy protection, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCCE is a hybrid framework combining a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable model for multi-objective discrete optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evolutionary algorithms get trapped in local optima in complex combinatorial spaces like molecular design, while existing LLM approaches either lack update capability (closed-source models) or sufficient reasoning strength (small open models).

Method: Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE) framework that maintains trajectory memory and uses reinforcement learning to progressively refine a small trainable model while collaborating with a frozen closed-source LLM for global exploration.

Result: MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality on multi-objective drug design benchmarks and consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems by combining knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning, creating a new paradigm for optimization.

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Motivation: Complex numbers offer superior representational power in neural networks, but their adoption in randomized neural networks has been limited due to lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular datasets into complex-valued representations.

Method: Two methods for generating complex-valued representations: natural transformation and autoencoder-driven method. RVFL-X integrates complex transformations while maintaining RVFL's simplicity, using complex components (input, weights, activation functions) to process complex representations and produce real-valued outputs.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate RVFL-X consistently outperforms both original RVFL and state-of-the-art RNN variants, showing robustness and effectiveness across diverse domains.

Conclusion: RVFL-X successfully bridges the gap between complex number representational power and randomized neural networks, providing an effective framework that maintains efficiency while significantly improving performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that can automatically recognize knots from photos, bridging the gap between visual perception and rigorous topological classification.

Method: Combines convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition with traditional algorithms for computing quantum invariants. Uses lightweight CNN and transformer architectures to predict crossing numbers directly from images.

Result: Shows that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information about knots from images, successfully predicting crossing numbers.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach demonstrates complementarity between machine learning (handling noisy visual data) and invariants (enforcing rigorous topological distinctions), providing a foundation for robust knot classification systems.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

TL;DR: Proposes Trajectory Transformer using transformer backbone for trajectory generation, addressing deviation issues in existing diffusion methods by replacing convolution-based architectures with transformer for better noise prediction and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for trajectory generation use convolution-based architectures (UNet) which cause notable deviations and loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity.

Method: Uses transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction, explores two GPS coordinate embedding strategies (location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding), analyzes performance at different scales.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architecture is superior to convolution-based methods for trajectory generation, providing better quality and reducing deviations while preserving fine-grained details.

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

TL;DR: BlockGPT is a novel generative autoregressive transformer for precipitation nowcasting that uses batched tokenization to predict full 2D frames at each time step, achieving superior accuracy and faster inference compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precipitation nowcasting methods have limitations - token-based autoregressive models suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models are computationally intensive. There's a need for accurate yet efficient models for real-time weather forecasting applications.

Method: BlockGPT uses a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction that factorizes space-time with self-attention within frames and causal attention across frames. It employs batched tokenization to predict complete 2D precipitation fields at each time step rather than individual tokens.

Result: BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy and event localization on KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.) precipitation datasets, with inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines like NowcastingGPT and DiffCast+Phydnet.

Conclusion: BlockGPT provides an effective solution for precipitation nowcasting that balances accuracy with computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time weather forecasting applications where both prediction quality and speed are critical.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

Motivation: To combine the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion models, avoiding costly end-to-end diffusion training while enabling high-throughput generation.

Method: Performs lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms well-trained autoregressive models into blockwise diffusion models through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via discrete diffusion.

Result: SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies show larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. The 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on scientific reasoning benchmarks like GPQA and ChemBench.

Conclusion: SDAR establishes a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning, demonstrating enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

### [112] [The Framework That Survives Bad Models: Human-AI Collaboration For Clinical Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06567)
*Yao Chen,David Ohlssen,Aimee Readie,Gregory Ligozio,Ruvie Martin,Thibaud Coroller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-SR (AI as supporting reader) is the most suitable AI framework for clinical trials as it maintains reliable disease estimation and preserves treatment effect conclusions even with severely degraded AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI promises to support clinical trials but deploying it without safeguards poses significant risks, especially when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial conclusions.

Method: Compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Stress-tested by injecting bad models (random guesses to naive predictions) to ensure treatment effects remain valid under model degradation.

Result: AI-SR framework met all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. It consistently provided reliable disease estimation and preserved clinical trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions across different populations.

Conclusion: Using AI as a supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials as it maintains reliability and preserves conclusions even under severe model degradation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

### [113] [Flexible Swarm Learning May Outpace Foundation Models in Essential Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06349)
*Moein E. Samadi,Andreas Schuppert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models show limited gains in dynamic real-world domains like ICU care. The paper proposes decentralized small agent networks (SANs) as superior to monolithic models for self-adaptive decision-making in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting AI to dynamic environments where foundation models show modest gains, particularly in complex domains like intensive care where systems have strongly interacting functions and shared side effects.

Method: Proposes a decentralized architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs) where each agent represents specialized substructures and covers only a subset of system functions, using swarm-learning in diverse swarms.

Result: Argues that self-adaptive SANs can deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments compared to monolithic foundation models, though with reduced reproducibility in detail.

Conclusion: AI should demonstrate clear superiority in complex dynamic settings before assuming broader decision-making roles, and decentralized SAN architectures offer a promising alternative to overcome the curse of dimensionality faced by monolithic models.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIKAN embeds physical principles into neural networks for UAV channel modeling, achieving DL-level accuracy with interpretability and 37x fewer parameters than MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between interpretable but rigid deterministic models and accurate but uninterpretable deep learning models for UAV air-to-ground channel modeling.

Method: Propose Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that embeds physical principles (free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) as flexible inductive biases in the learning process.

Result: PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic, explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws, using only 232 parameters (37x lighter than MLP baselines).

Conclusion: PIKAN is an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modeling in beyond-5G and 6G networks.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

*Luca Wolf,Tobias Buck,Bjoern Malte Schaefer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Helmholtz metrics to quantify how closely neural ODE solutions resemble physical Euler-Lagrange equations, and develops Lagrangian neural ODEs that can learn Euler-Lagrange equations directly from positional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ODEs are powerful but not all solutions are physical Euler-Lagrange equations, which limits their applicability to physics problems where physical consistency is important.

Method: Developed Helmholtz metrics to measure resemblance to Euler-Lagrange equations, and created Lagrangian neural ODEs that combine these metrics with second-order neural ODEs to learn Euler-Lagrange equations directly.

Result: The approach can distinguish Lagrangian from non-Lagrangian systems using only positional data, and improves neural ODE solutions while maintaining zero additional inference cost.

Conclusion: Helmholtz metrics and Lagrangian neural ODEs provide a way to ensure physical consistency in neural ODE solutions and improve their performance on physics problems.

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

### [116] [The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401)
*Ali Hussaini Umar,Franky Kevin Nando Tezoh,Jean Barbier,Santiago Acevedo,Alessandro Laio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how label noise affects neural network hidden representations using Information Imbalance analysis, revealing double descent behavior and showing overparameterized networks are robust to label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While label noise impact on model performance is well-studied, its effects on hidden representations remain poorly understood, creating a gap in understanding how networks internally process noisy data.

Method: Systematic comparison of hidden representations using Information Imbalance (a proxy for conditional mutual information) across different network parameterization regimes, analyzing both noisy and clean label training.

Result: Hidden representations show double descent behavior similar to test error. Underparameterized networks learn more informative representations with noisy labels, while overparameterized networks show equal informativeness regardless of label noise. Training on random labels drives networks beyond lazy learning.

Conclusion: Overparameterized networks' representations are robust to label noise, and the information imbalance between layers decreases with cross-entropy loss, offering new insights into generalization in classification tasks.

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chem-NMF: A novel multi-layer NMF method using Boltzmann probability from chemical reactions to ensure convergence, improving clustering accuracy on biomedical signals and face images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending NMF with α-divergence to multi-layer architectures faces convergence challenges, requiring theoretical analysis inspired by physical chemistry principles.

Method: Proposed Chem-NMF with bounding factor based on Boltzmann probability of energy barriers in chemical reactions to stabilize convergence in multi-layer NMF.

Result: Improved clustering accuracy by 5.6% ± 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% ± 7.2% on face images compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: First study applying physical chemistry perspective to analyze NMF convergence; Chem-NMF provides theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

*Rishabh Ranjan,Valter Hudovernik,Mark Znidar,Charilaos Kanatsoulis,Roshan Upendra,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Tom Palczewski,Carlos Guestrin,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Relational Transformer (RT) is a novel architecture that enables zero-shot transfer learning across diverse relational databases without task-specific fine-tuning, achieving strong performance through relational attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational domains lack architectures that can transfer across datasets and tasks due to the diversity of relational data with varying schemas, graph structures, and functional dependencies.

Method: RT tokenizes cells with table/column metadata, uses masked token prediction for pretraining, and employs a novel Relational Attention mechanism over columns, rows, and primary-foreign key links.

Result: RT achieves 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification tasks with zero-shot transfer using a 22M parameter model, outperforming a 27B LLM (84%). Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency.

Conclusion: RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational data by effectively harnessing task-table context, relational attention patterns, and schema semantics.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

*Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCPS is a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm that improves upon GRAVE by including permutation statistics in the exploration term, performing better in two-player games and eliminating the need for GRAVE's bias hyperparameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a better MCTS algorithm for scenarios where deep reinforcement learning isn't feasible or computing power is limited, such as in General Game Playing, by improving upon the GRAVE algorithm.

Method: MCPS includes in the exploration term the statistics on all playouts that contain all moves on the path from root to node, uses abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes, and provides improved mathematical formulas for weighting statistics without GRAVE's bias hyperparameter.

Result: MCPS outperforms GRAVE in all two-player games tested (board games, wargame, investment game, video game) and has equivalent results in multi-player games. It's not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter and benefits from using abstract move codes.

Conclusion: MCPS is a superior alternative to GRAVE for two-player games when deep reinforcement learning isn't an option, offering better performance while eliminating the bias hyperparameter dependency and maintaining robustness across different game types.

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

### [120] [Making and Evaluating Calibrated Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06388)
*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, extending previous binary-only truthful measures. It identifies which extension methods preserve truthfulness and demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing measures like binned ECE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration measures were non-truthful, incentivizing predictors to lie to appear more calibrated. Recent work introduced truthful measures for binary tasks, but multi-class truthful calibration measures were lacking. The paper aims to address this gap and improve robustness over problematic measures like binned ECE.

Method: The authors generalize truthful calibration measures from binary to multi-class prediction by studying different extension methods. They mathematically analyze which extension approaches preserve truthfulness and develop a perfectly truthful measure for multi-class settings. They also conduct empirical verification of robustness properties.

Result: The paper successfully develops a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks. The measure exhibits superior robustness by preserving ordering between dominant and dominated predictors regardless of hyperparameter choices (bin sizes), addressing the non-robustness issues of binned ECE observed in prior work.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration measure provides the first perfectly truthful solution for multi-class prediction, with proven mathematical guarantees and empirical validation of its robustness advantages over existing measures like binned ECE.

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

TL;DR: Non-Euclidean models in curved spaces like hyperbolic geometry have boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit, making small input changes appear subtle but cause large representation shifts near the boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formalize the geometric vulnerability in non-Euclidean foundation models where boundary effects create asymmetric behavior that can be exploited by backdoor attacks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of boundary-driven asymmetry in curved spaces, formalization of the effect, and development of a geometry-adaptive trigger evaluated across tasks and architectures.

Result: Attack success increases toward the boundary while conventional detectors weaken, matching theoretical predictions. Defenses that pull points inward suppress triggers but sacrifice useful model sensitivity.

Conclusion: Non-Euclidean models have geometry-specific vulnerabilities at boundaries that require analysis-backed defense design, with inherent trade-offs between security and model sensitivity.

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether bigger models are always better for time series forecasting, and investigate alternatives to single large monolithic models by creating portfolios of smaller pretrained models.

Method: Create portfolios of smaller specialist forecasting models and apply ensembling or model selection strategies. Use post-training of base models to create diverse specialists efficiently.

Result: Collections of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently trained generalists. Ensembling and model selection are more compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Building portfolios of smaller specialist models is a compute-effective alternative to large monolithic time series foundation models, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic
model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By
applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently
trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model
is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

*Eliot Shekhtman,Yichen Zhou,Ingvar Ziemann,Nikolai Matni,Stephen Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops instance-optimal learning bounds for multi-trajectory data using Hellinger localization, improving over standard reductions to i.i.d. learning or single-trajectory mixing assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of sequential learning is incomplete for multi-trajectory settings, which reflect modern training pipelines but lack instance-optimal bounds beyond least-squares regression with dependent covariates.

Method: Uses Hellinger localization framework: first controls squared Hellinger distance at path-measure level via reduction to i.i.d. learning, then performs localization as quadratic form in parameter space weighted by trajectory Fisher information.

Result: Achieves instance-optimal bounds that scale with full data budget under broad conditions, demonstrated across four case studies including mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression, generalized linear models, and linear-attention sequence models.

Conclusion: The framework significantly broadens scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings, nearly matching asymptotic normality rates and substantially improving over standard reductions.

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty that uses statistical surrogates and closed-form expressions to reduce computational cost by 40x compared to Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning is challenging when systems involve uncertainty, and optimization under uncertainty with noisy function evaluations can be computationally expensive.

Method: Uses Bayesian optimization with statistical surrogates for underlying random variables, enabling analytical evaluation of expectation operators and deriving closed-form expressions for optimizer of random acquisition functions.

Result: The proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points than conventional Monte Carlo-based optimization, achieving up to 40-fold reduction in computational cost.

Conclusion: The method is effective for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty, particularly for optimizing scale- or precision-type parameters in stochastic models, as demonstrated through computational engineering examples.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach to forecast model performance in decentralized networks, enabling proactive weight assignment instead of reactive averaging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear pooling methods in decentralized learning are reactive and slow to adapt to changing circumstances due to their reliance on historical performance averaging.

Method: Develop a performance forecasting model that predicts future model performance using machine learning, enabling context-aware weight assignment based on forecasted accuracy rather than historical averages.

Result: Forecasting models that predict regret or regret z-scores show greater improvement than loss-based models, with performance sensitive to feature set choices and training epochs.

Conclusion: Performance forecasting enables predictive model weighting that can improve decentralized network accuracy and may be useful in any scenario requiring predictive rather than reactive model combination.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

### [126] [How NOT to benchmark your SITE metric: Beyond Static Leaderboards and Towards Realistic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06448)
*Prabhant Singh,Sibylle Hess,Joaquin Vanschoren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for evaluating transferability estimation metrics are flawed, with unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies that artificially inflate metric performance, making simple heuristics competitive with sophisticated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify shortcomings in widely used benchmark setups for transferability estimation metrics, which are used to select pre-trained models for target tasks without fine-tuning or source data access.

Method: Empirical analysis demonstrating that current benchmarks have fundamental flaws, including unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies that distort metric evaluation.

Result: Simple, dataset-agnostic heuristics can outperform sophisticated transferability estimation methods under current flawed benchmark conditions, revealing artificial performance inflation.

Conclusion: Current evaluation protocols are disconnected from real-world model selection complexities, requiring more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide meaningful future research.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

*Enrique Queipo-de-Llano,Álvaro Arroyo,Federico Barbero,Xiaowen Dong,Michael Bronstein,Yann LeCun,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a connection between attention sinks and compression valleys in LLMs, showing both result from massive activations in the residual stream. It proposes a Mix-Compress-Refine theory explaining how LLMs organize computation across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling phenomena of attention sinks and compression valleys in large language models, which have been studied separately but may share common underlying mechanisms.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving massive activations cause representational compression with entropy bounds, plus experiments across models (410M-120B parameters) and targeted ablation studies to validate predictions.

Result: Confirmed that when beginning-of-sequence tokens develop extreme activation norms in middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. The unified view explains task-dependent representation differences.

Conclusion: Proposes Mix-Compress-Refine theory: LLMs process tokens in three phases - broad mixing (early layers), compressed computation (middle layers), and selective refinement (late layers). This explains why embedding tasks work best at intermediate layers while generation benefits from full-depth processing.

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

*Sanjeda Akter,Ibne Farabi Shihab,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential-EDFL applies anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping, using information lift tracking with formal error control, reducing generation by 22-28% while maintaining statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for early stopping of language model generation that provides formal statistical guarantees regardless of when stopping occurs, reducing computational costs while maintaining reliability.

Method: Tracks information lift (log-likelihood ratio between full models and weakened skeleton baselines) using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes with online mean estimation, mixture e-processes for multiple parameters, and adaptive resets for distributional drift.

Result: Reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines across six benchmarks while maintaining delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. When composed with a correctness gate, improves end-task correctness while preserving guarantees.

Conclusion: EDFL serves as an effective first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, but is not a standalone solution for safety-critical domains since it controls information sufficiency rather than factual correctness.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

### [129] [GUIDE: Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06502)
*Khoa Trinh,Gaurav Menghani,Erik Vee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE is a distillation technique that forces student models to match teacher models in parameter space rather than just output space, achieving 25-26% reduction in teacher-student quality gap with no training or inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard distillation methods only make students match teacher outputs, but given the high cost of training large teacher models, more useful information should be extracted from teachers.

Method: GUIDE (Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings) forces student models to match teacher models in the parameter space, and can be combined with knowledge distillation for additive improvements.

Result: 25-26% reduction in teacher-student quality gap for large student models (400M-1B parameters) trained on ≈20B tokens. GUIDE alone performs substantially better than knowledge distillation alone.

Conclusion: GUIDE provides significant quality improvements over standard distillation with no training or inference overhead, making the gains virtually free.

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

TL;DR: ATLO-ML is an adaptive system that automatically optimizes input time length and sampling rate for time-series predictions based on user-defined output time length, improving ML model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate time-series predictions in ML are heavily dependent on proper selection of input time length and sampling rate, which are often chosen manually or arbitrarily.

Method: ATLO-ML adaptively determines optimal input time length and sampling rate based on user-defined output time length, providing flexible time-series data pre-processing with dynamic parameter adjustment.

Result: Validation on air quality datasets (GAMS-dataset and proprietary data center data) shows optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improve ML model accuracy compared to fixed time lengths.

Conclusion: ATLO-ML demonstrates potential for generalization across time-sensitive applications and offers a robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in ML workflows.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

*Momin Abbas,Ali Falahati,Hossein Goli,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Medix is a novel OOD detection framework that uses median operations to identify outliers from unlabeled data, then trains a robust OOD classifier using these identified outliers and labeled in-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data for OOD detection is challenging due to mixed in-distribution and OOD samples, and the lack of distinct OOD samples complicates training optimal OOD classifiers.

Method: Uses median operation to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data, leveraging median's robustness against noise and outliers. Then trains OOD classifier using identified outliers and labeled in-distribution data.

Result: Medix outperforms existing methods across the board in open-world settings. Theoretical error bounds demonstrate low error rate.

Conclusion: Medix provides an effective framework for OOD detection using unlabeled data, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation of its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-image leaderboards are vulnerable to model deanonymization attacks using simple CLIP-based classification, enabling easier rank manipulation than in LLM leaderboards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that text-to-image leaderboards are more vulnerable to deanonymization attacks than LLM leaderboards, making rank manipulation easier.

Method: Used 150,000+ images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models, employing real-time classification in CLIP embedding space without prompt control or historical data. Introduced prompt-level separability metric.

Result: Simple CLIP-based classification achieved high accuracy in identifying generating models, with some prompts enabling near-perfect deanonymization.

Conclusion: Rank manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously recognized, highlighting the need for stronger defensive measures.

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

TL;DR: Randomly initialized neural networks with zero-mean activation functions have nearly independent outputs, supporting computational no-coincidence conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when neural networks have independent outputs and support interpretability research through the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture.

Method: Analyze randomly initialized neural networks with large width and specific hyperparameters, focusing on activation functions with zero mean under Gaussian measure.

Result: Found that networks with zero-mean activation functions (like shifted ReLU, GeLU, tanh) have nearly independent outputs, while standard ReLU/GeLU do not.

Conclusion: Zero-mean activation functions are promising for testing computational no-coincidence conjecture and improving AI interpretability.

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes transforming POMDPs into finite-state Superstate MDPs using finite histories, enabling approximate solution via TD-learning and policy optimization with provable error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs creates computational challenges for learning optimal policies, motivating the need for approximate methods that can leverage standard MDP techniques.

Method: Transform POMDP into Superstate MDP using finite histories, then apply policy-based learning with linear function approximation using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization.

Result: Derived improved theoretical guarantees relating Superstate MDP to original POMDP, showing approximation error decreases exponentially with history length. Provides first finite-time bounds quantifying TD learning error in non-Markovian settings.

Conclusion: POMDPs can be approximately solved as MDPs using finite histories, with provable exponential error reduction and quantifiable finite-time performance guarantees.

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

TL;DR: The paper mathematically analyzes incoherence in reinforcement learning policies from naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models, showing that online RL fine-tuning reduces incoherence and improves returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural issue of incoherence in reinforcement learning policies derived from naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models, and to characterize how online fine-tuning addresses this problem.

Method: Mathematical investigation of incoherence, analysis of re-training models on their own actions through online RL fine-tuning, and establishing a three-way correspondence between control-as-inference, soft Q learning, and posterior folding into rewards.

Result: Proved that online RL fine-tuning decreases incoherence and leads to improved returns, established connections between different interpretations of iterative re-training, and linked incoherence to effective horizon through soft-conditioning generative models.

Conclusion: The iterative re-training process can be understood through multiple equivalent perspectives, and incoherence reduction through online fine-tuning is mathematically justified and connected to fundamental RL concepts like effective horizon.

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

TL;DR: Markovian Thinking paradigm enables linear compute scaling for long-chain reasoning by structuring reasoning into fixed-size chunks with state carryover, eliminating quadratic attention costs of traditional RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL for reasoning LLMs suffers from quadratic compute costs as thought chains lengthen due to unbounded state size in the thinking environment.

Method: Proposed Delethink RL environment with fixed-size reasoning chunks and state carryover at boundaries, training policies to write sufficient textual state for seamless continuation after context reset.

Result: 1.5B model achieves 24K token reasoning with 8K-token chunks, matching LongCoT-RL performance but with linear compute scaling and substantial cost reduction (27 vs 7 H100-months at 96K length).

Conclusion: Redesigning the thinking environment enables efficient long reasoning without quadratic overhead, opening path to scalable reasoning LLMs with linear compute scaling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: DPA-Net estimates Ambulatory Glucose Profile metrics from sparse SMBG data using dual-path attention network with spatial-channel reconstruction and multi-scale ResNet, achieving robust accuracy comparable to CGM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM provides reliable glucose metrics but is expensive and inaccessible, while SMBG is affordable but produces sparse data that's hard to translate into clinically meaningful metrics.

Method: Dual-Path Attention Neural Network with spatial-channel attention path for CGM-like trajectory reconstruction and multi-scale ResNet path for direct AGP prediction, plus alignment mechanism and active point selector.

Result: DPA-Net achieves robust accuracy with low errors and reduced systematic bias on large real-world dataset.

Conclusion: First supervised ML framework for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, providing practical decision-support tool where CGM is inaccessible.

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

TL;DR: POME is a post-optimization algorithm that improves fine-tuned LLMs by applying muon-style projection with truncated SVD to weight differences, requiring no extra data or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance fine-tuned language model performance without additional data or optimization overhead, making improvements universally applicable across different model sizes and training frameworks.

Method: Apply muon-style projection to ΔW (weight differences between fine-tuned and pretrained models) using truncated SVD to equalize dominant update directions and prune noisy small singular values.

Result: Consistent performance gains: +2.5% on GSM8K and +1.0% on code generation, applicable from 7B to 72B models including RLHF-instructed models.

Conclusion: POME provides a practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline as a simple post-processing step that requires no modifications to training infrastructure.

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground water pipelines suffer from leaks and infiltrations causing water loss and environmental damage, while conventional inspections are inefficient and dense sensor deployments are too expensive.

Method: Integrated AI and remote-sensor framework using sparse sensor deployments to capture real-time flow/depth data, combined with HydroNet model that uses pipeline attributes (material, diameter, slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling with edge-aware message passing and hydraulic simulations.

Result: Evaluation on real-world campus wastewater network dataset shows the system collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data and HydroNet outperforms advanced baselines, enabling accurate network-wide predictions from limited sensor deployments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates edge-aware message passing with hydraulic simulations and can be extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Motivation: Flow matching has been primarily used for noise-to-data transformations, but its application to general distribution-to-distribution settings is underexplored. Standard flow matching fails when the source is a data distribution learned from limited samples due to sparse supervision.

Method: The method injects stochasticity into training by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants, making it simple and computationally efficient.

Result: On five diverse imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, the method significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by an average of 9 FID points, and reduces transport cost between input and generated samples.

Conclusion: This approach makes flow matching a more practical tool for simulating diverse distribution transformations in scientific applications like drug discovery and evolutionary simulation.

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

### [141] [StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06635)
*Yunpeng Gong,Sihan Lan,Can Yang,Kunpeng Xu,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StruSR is a structure-aware symbolic regression framework that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract physical priors from time series data, guiding symbolic expression evolution through local Taylor expansions and genetic programming with physics-aware fitness functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods lack mechanisms to extract structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior and physical laws.

Method: Uses trained PINNs to extract locally structured physical priors via local Taylor expansions. Introduces masking-based attribution mechanism to quantify subtree contributions. Employs genetic programming with physics-aware mutation/crossover operations guided by sensitivity scores. Uses hybrid fitness function minimizing physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch.

Result: Experiments on benchmark PDE systems show improved convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines.

Conclusion: StruSR offers a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery by effectively integrating neural network priors with symbolic regression through structure-aware evolutionary operations.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

*Prakhar Srivastava,Farrin Marouf Sofian,Francesco Immorlano,Kushagra Pandey,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an amortized framework that enhances pretrained Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) with a lightweight controller network for data assimilation in chaotic spatiotemporal PDEs, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) is underexplored, and existing methods for data assimilation in chaotic PDEs are computationally expensive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations.

Method: An amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective.

Result: The method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes, reducing DA inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing data assimilation methods for chaotic PDEs by avoiding expensive computations during inference and achieving better performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

### [143] [The False Promise of Zero-Shot Super-Resolution in Machine-Learned Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06646)
*Mansi Sakarvadia,Kareem Hegazy,Amin Totounferoush,Kyle Chard,Yaoqing Yang,Ian Foster,Michael W. Mahoney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine-learned operators (MLOs) fail at zero-shot super-resolution and multi-resolution inference due to aliasing and inability to extrapolate/interpolate across resolutions. A simple multi-resolution training protocol is proposed to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether MLOs can perform zero-shot super-resolution and multi-resolution inference, which is crucial for modeling continuous phenomena in scientific machine learning.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of MLOs' zero-shot multi-resolution capabilities, decoupling the problem into extrapolation to varying frequencies and interpolation across resolutions. A data-driven multi-resolution training protocol is proposed to overcome identified limitations.

Result: MLOs fail to perform zero-shot super-resolution and multi-resolution inference, showing brittleness and susceptibility to aliasing when tested on resolutions different from training data.

Conclusion: MLOs cannot perform accurate zero-shot multi-resolution inference without specialized training, but a proposed multi-resolution training protocol enables robust generalization across resolutions.

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARQ, a novel value estimation method that applies Forward-Forward algorithm's goodness function and action conditioning for local reinforcement learning using temporal difference learning, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art backprop-free RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Forward-Forward algorithm remains largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap in domains like reinforcement learning where learning signals can be yielded more naturally.

Method: Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ) applies a goodness function and action conditioning for local RL using temporal difference learning, inspired by FF's layer activity statistics approach.

Result: ARQ achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in MinAtar and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with backpropagation on most tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ARQ method successfully bridges the gap between Forward-Forward algorithm and reinforcement learning, demonstrating that biologically-grounded local learning approaches can achieve competitive performance in RL domains.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

*Weiguo Lu,Gangnan Yuan,Hong-kun Zhang,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMNM introduces Gaussian mixture-inspired nonlinear modules that enhance neural network architectures by leveraging Gaussian kernel properties, improving performance across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural networks are limited by their activation functions' nonlinearity. GMNM aims to overcome this by using Gaussian mixture models' universal density approximation capabilities.

Method: GMNM modules relax probabilistic constraints and use flexible Gaussian projections, allowing seamless integration into MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs for end-to-end training.

Result: Experiments show GMNM consistently improves performance over standard baselines when incorporated into various neural architectures.

Conclusion: GMNM demonstrates potential as a powerful and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across diverse machine learning applications.

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

*Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Zeyu Bao,Ruoxi Yu,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how the number of attention heads in transformers affects their expressive power, establishing theoretical bounds on parameter complexity for approximation and showing that insufficient heads lead to exponential parameter scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite transformers being dominant for sequence modeling, there's limited understanding of how structural parameters like attention heads influence expressive power. The paper aims to provide rigorous theoretical analysis of transformers' approximation properties.

Method: Introduced a generalized D-retrieval task proven to be dense in continuous functions, then established upper and lower bounds on parameter complexity for ε-approximation. Analyzed single-head transformers and conducted experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: Transformers with sufficient heads allow efficient approximation, but with too few heads, parameters must scale as O(1/ε^{cT}) (exponential in sequence length). Single-head transformers require O(T) embedding dimension for complete memorization via feed-forward blocks.

Conclusion: The number of attention heads is crucial for transformers' expressive power, with insufficient heads leading to exponential parameter requirements. This provides the first rigorous lower bounds in nonlinear, practical settings and validates theoretical findings with experiments.

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

*Udbhav Bamba,Minghao Fang,Yifan Yu,Haizhong Zheng,Fan Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XRPO is a reinforcement learning framework that improves LLM reasoning by adaptively allocating rollouts to prompts with high uncertainty reduction potential and amplifying low-probability correct responses through novelty-aware advantage sharpening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like GRPO suffer from limited exploration on challenging prompts and underexploited feedback signals due to context-independent rollout allocation and reliance on sparse rewards.

Method: XRPO introduces an adaptive rollout allocator for exploration, in-context seeding for difficult prompts, and group-relative novelty-aware advantage sharpening for exploitation using sequence likelihoods.

Result: XRPO outperforms GRPO and GSPO by up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32 across math and coding benchmarks, while accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

Conclusion: XRPO provides a principled exploration-exploitation framework that significantly improves LLM reasoning performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

### [148] [TimeFormer: Transformer with Attention Modulation Empowered by Temporal Characteristics for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06680)
*Zhipeng Liu,Peibo Duan,Xuan Tang,Baixin Li,Yongsheng Huang,Mingyang Geng,Changsheng Zhang,Bin Zhang,Binwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeFormer is a novel Transformer architecture for time series forecasting that incorporates temporal priors through a modulated self-attention mechanism and multi-scale analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are effective in NLP but face challenges in time series forecasting due to insufficient consideration of temporal modality differences, particularly unidirectional influence and decaying influence over time.

Method: Proposes TimeFormer with MoSA (modulated self-attention) mechanism that captures temporal priors under Hawkes process constraints and causal masking, plus multi-scale subsequence analysis for capturing semantic dependencies at different temporal scales.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world datasets, achieving up to 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to best baselines and setting new benchmarks on 94.04% of evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TimeFormer effectively addresses temporal characteristics in time series forecasting and the MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance other Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

*Daoyuan Zhou,Xuchuang Wang,Lin Yang,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed algorithm for multiplayer multi-armed bandits with adaptive communication achieves near-optimal regret with minimal communication cost, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the stochastic multiplayer multi-armed bandit problem in distributed settings without central coordination, where collisions between players reduce rewards and communication efficiency is crucial.

Method: Proposed a distributed algorithm with adaptive communication protocol that uses only O(log log T) communication cost, allowing players to coordinate while observing only their own actions and collision feedback.

Result: Achieves near-optimal group and individual regret with significantly reduced communication overhead. Experiments show substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in reducing individual regret.

Conclusion: The adaptive communication approach effectively balances coordination and efficiency in distributed multiplayer bandits. The method also extends to periodic asynchronous settings with logarithmic regret guarantees.

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

*Kang An,Chenhao Si,Ming Yan,Shiqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoBalance introduces a post-combine training paradigm for PINNs that assigns independent adaptive optimizers to each loss component, overcoming limitations of traditional pre-combine methods that struggle with conflicting loss terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training PINNs is difficult due to conflicting objectives and different curvatures in multiple loss terms (PDE residuals and boundary conditions), which disrupts optimizer preconditioning in traditional approaches.

Method: AutoBalance uses a post-combine strategy where each loss component gets its own adaptive optimizer, and the preconditioned updates are aggregated afterwards rather than combining gradients before optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks with significant reductions in solution error measured by both MSE and L∞ norms.

Conclusion: AutoBalance is orthogonal and complementary to other PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding benchmarks while solving fundamental training challenges.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

### [151] [Is the Hard-Label Cryptanalytic Model Extraction Really Polynomial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06692)
*Akira Ito,Takayuki Miura,Yosuke Todo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in existing hard-label model extraction attacks and proposes CrossLayer Extraction to overcome exponential query complexity by exploiting neuron interactions across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model extraction attacks assume unrealistic conditions that require exponential queries for deeper networks, making them impractical for real-world scenarios where only hard-label outputs are available.

Method: Proposes CrossLayer Extraction method that exploits neuron interactions across layers instead of directly extracting individual neuron parameters, reducing query complexity significantly.

Result: The new attack method overcomes the exponential query complexity limitation of existing approaches and enables more practical model extraction in hard-label settings.

Conclusion: CrossLayer Extraction provides a more efficient and practical approach to model extraction in hard-label scenarios by leveraging cross-layer neuron interactions, addressing critical limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

*Gal Fadlon,Idan Arbiv,Nimrod Berman,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-step framework for generating realistic irregular time series data that first completes missing values using a Time Series Transformer, then uses a vision-based diffusion model with masking to generate high-quality sequences efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular sampling and missing values in time series data present significant challenges for generation tasks. Existing methods yield suboptimal results with high computational costs, and simple masking approaches create unnatural neighborhoods that disrupt learning.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Time Series Transformer completes irregular sequences to create natural neighborhoods, 2) Vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on completed values while leveraging image representations for efficient generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 70% relative improvement in discriminative score and 85% reduction in computational cost compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines completion and masking strategies to enable robust and efficient generation of realistic irregular time series data, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

*Seohong Park,Deepinder Mann,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual goal representations encode states by their temporal distances to all other states, providing dynamics-invariant representations that improve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal representations in GCRL may be sensitive to the original state representation and contain exogenous noise. The authors aim to create a representation that depends only on intrinsic dynamics and filters out irrelevant information while preserving optimal policy recovery.

Method: Develop dual goal representations that characterize states by the set of temporal distances to all other states. This representation is learned through a practical method that can be combined with any existing GCRL algorithm.

Result: Empirical evaluation on OGBench task suite shows consistent improvement in offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based tasks when using dual goal representations.

Conclusion: Dual goal representations provide theoretically grounded, dynamics-invariant representations that enhance GCRL performance by capturing essential temporal distance relationships between states while filtering out exogenous noise.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

*Zachris Björkman,Jorge Loría,Sophie Wharrie,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous domains using Bayesian experimental design and a variational mixture structure learning method to infer mixtures of causal Bayesian networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian causal discovery needs prior information from domain experts, but existing prior elicitation approaches assume a single causal graph and are unsuitable for heterogeneous domains where multiple causal models may exist.

Method: Proposes a causal elicitation strategy based on Bayesian experimental design principles and VaMSL (variational mixture structure learning) method that extends DiBS (differentiable Bayesian structure learning) to iteratively infer mixtures of causal Bayesian networks.

Result: The method successfully produces sets of alternative causal models (mixture components/clusters) and achieves improved structure learning performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by simulated expert feedback.

Conclusion: The approach is capable of capturing complex distributions in real-world data, as demonstrated with a breast cancer database, providing an effective solution for causal discovery in heterogeneous domains.

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

*Shivam Padmani,Akshay Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new methodology for function regression using the Forward-Forward algorithm, extending its application beyond classification tasks to include univariate and multivariate function approximation, with preliminary studies on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function regression is a fundamental machine learning task, and while neural networks can be trained for this purpose, the Forward-Forward learning algorithm has been limited to classification tasks. The authors aim to extend this novel training paradigm to function approximation.

Method: The paper develops a new methodology for function regression using the Forward-Forward algorithm, evaluating it on both univariate and multivariate functions. The approach includes preliminary extensions to Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Result: The methodology successfully enables function regression using the Forward-Forward algorithm, demonstrating its applicability beyond classification tasks. The evaluation covers various function types and includes preliminary integration with advanced network architectures.

Conclusion: The Forward-Forward algorithm can be effectively extended to function regression tasks, opening up new possibilities for training neural networks without backpropagation in applications like neuromorphic computing and physical neural networks.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs used to solve inverse SIR model with German COVID-19 data, enabling spatio-temporal analysis of transmission parameters across federal states over 3 years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compartmental models like SIR have limitations incorporating noisy observational data directly, and there's need for quantitative modeling to understand real-world disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to solve inverse problem of SIR model using infection data from Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for all German federal states.

Result: Estimated state-specific transmission/recovery parameters and time-varying reproduction number (R_t), revealing strong regional variations in transmission behavior correlated with vaccination uptake and pandemic phases.

Conclusion: PINNs demonstrate utility for localized, long-term epidemiological modeling by enabling fine-grained spatio-temporal analysis of disease dynamics.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

*Tavish McDonald,Bo Lei,Stanislav Fort,Bhavya Kailkhura,Brian Bartoldson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-compute defenses improve robustness to adversarial OOD data when models can compositionally generalize from ID components, creating a rich-get-richer dynamic where robustified models benefit more from test-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation where test-time reasoning benefits fade against gradient-based or multimodal attacks, and clarify that inference-compute offers robustness benefits even in these challenging scenarios.

Method: Propose the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH) - inference-compute defenses work when training data reflects attacked data's components, enabling compositional generalization. Test across vision language models and attack types with defensive specification prompting.

Result: Robustness gains from test-time compute occur when compositional generalization enables specification following on OOD data. Prompting lowers success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on robustified VLMs, but not on non-robustified models.

Conclusion: Inference-compute's robustness benefit correlates with base model robustness (rich-get-richer dynamic). Recommend layering train-time and test-time defenses for synergistic benefits.

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

*Giovanni Donghi,Daniele Zambon,Luca Pasa,Cesare Alippi,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple approach using fixed random encoder with online classifier training achieves state-of-the-art performance in Online Continual Graph Learning, reducing catastrophic forgetting without complex mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Online Continual Graph Learning where nodes arrive sequentially and distribution drifts occur, eliminating the need for complex replay or regularization methods.

Method: Use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate node embeddings through neighborhood aggregation, while training only a lightweight classifier online. Freezing the encoder prevents representation parameter drifts.

Result: Consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks, with up to 30% improvement and performance approaching joint offline-training upper bound, despite no memory buffer.

Conclusion: Catastrophic forgetting in OCGL can be effectively minimized through architectural simplicity and stability rather than complex replay or regularization techniques.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitTokens is a novel tokenization method that encodes numbers as single tokens using IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation, enabling LLMs to handle numerical calculations more efficiently without excessive reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with numerical data processing, requiring extensive reasoning tokens for basic calculations due to inefficient tokenization that splits numbers into multiple tokens, limiting their ability to solve complex numerical problems.

Method: Proposed BitTokens - a tokenization strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation, with a set of desiderata for effective number encodings.

Result: BitTokens enable even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic arithmetic operations nearly perfectly, significantly improving numerical processing efficiency.

Conclusion: BitTokens provide an efficient single-token number encoding that could expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve, addressing current limitations in numerical data processing.

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

### [160] [Recurrence-Complete Frame-based Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06828)
*Michael Keiblinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the view that attention mechanisms alone are sufficient for all tasks, arguing that recurrent architectures are necessary for long-running agentic tasks. It introduces a recurrence-complete architecture that shows improved performance on longer sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of purely attention-based models in handling long-running agentic tasks, where non-recurrent architectures fail to properly aggregate inputs over extended time periods.

Method: The authors introduce a recurrence-complete architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences, analyzing loss patterns and training efficiency across different sequence lengths.

Result: The results show that loss follows a power law with trained sequence length while parameter count remains fixed. Longer-sequence training amortizes its linearly increasing wall-time cost and yields lower loss as a function of wall time.

Conclusion: Recurrent architectures are essential for long-running agentic tasks, and the proposed recurrence-complete model demonstrates improved scaling properties and training efficiency compared to non-recurrent alternatives.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

TL;DR: Proposes an Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework that predicts wind turbine alarms before they trigger, using LSTM-based regression for time-series forecasting and classification for alarm tagging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches use alarm data only for diagnostics after faults occur. This study aims to transform alarm management by preventing alarms from triggering altogether, thereby averting impending failures through proactive intervention.

Method: Two-module AFC framework: 1) LSTM-based regression module for time-series alarm forecasting, 2) Classification module for alarm tagging on forecasted alarms. Tested on 14 Senvion MM82 turbines over 5 years.

Result: Achieved 82%, 52%, and 41% accurate forecasts for 10, 20, and 30-minute alarm forecasts respectively. Enables forecasting of entire alarm taxonomy rather than specific alarms.

Conclusion: The framework successfully anticipates and averts alarms, significantly reducing alarm frequency and enhancing operational efficiency through proactive maintenance.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive

Motivation: To accelerate attention kernels in machine learning models by vectorizing FlashAttention for RISC-V vector processors, reducing scalar code and computational complexity.

Method: Used low-cost exponential approximations in floating-point arithmetic without custom ISA extensions, implemented vectorized FlashAttention, and explored tiling strategies for memory locality.

Result: Experimental results show scalable approach with significant performance gains in processing attention layers in practical applications.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated vectorized FlashAttention implementation that improves performance on RISC-V vector processors through efficient exponential approximations and memory optimization techniques.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture (CNN-TFT) with explainability (SHAP-MHAW) for multivariate time series forecasting, achieving 2.2% MAPE on hydroelectric flow data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine CNN's local pattern capture with Transformer's long-range dependency modeling to enhance multivariate time series forecasting performance.

Method: Hierarchical 1D CNN for local feature extraction followed by Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) with multi-head attention for capturing short- and long-term dependencies and adaptive covariate weighting.

Result: Outperforms established deep learning models with 2.2% mean absolute percentage error on hydroelectric natural flow dataset.

Conclusion: The CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW architecture is promising for high-fidelity multivariate time series forecasting applications, with explainability through SHAP with multi-head attention weights.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models (LR, RF, SVM) outperform traditional statistical methods in predicting bank bankruptcy, achieving 90% accuracy with RF on commercial bank data and accurately predicting rural bank failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical models like Altman's Z-Score have limitations due to rigid assumptions and low forecast accuracy, necessitating more effective approaches for banking system stability and risk management.

Method: Used logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines on financial data from Turkish commercial banks (44 active, 21 bankrupt, 1994-2004) and Indonesian rural banks (43 active, 43 bankrupt, 2013-2019).

Result: Random forest achieved 90% accuracy in predicting commercial bank bankruptcy, and all three machine learning methods accurately predicted rural bank bankruptcy likelihood.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches provide superior bankruptcy prediction capabilities that can help implement policies to reduce bankruptcy costs and maintain financial system stability.

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

TL;DR: A Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN) is proposed for AC Optimal Power Flow, achieving 1,000-10,000x speedup with <1% optimality gap on default topologies and <3% gap on unseen topologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACOPF is computationally expensive for large power systems, and existing ML approaches lack scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining.

Method: HH-MPNN models power system components as distinct node/edge types and uses a scalable transformer for long-range dependencies, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies.

Result: Achieves <1% optimality gap on default topologies (14-2,000 buses), <3% gap on unseen topologies, and 1,000-10,000x speedup compared to interior point solvers.

Conclusion: HH-MPNN advances practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations with strong scalability and topology adaptability.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

TL;DR: SaFeR-VLM is a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning processes, addressing the "Reasoning Tax" phenomenon where reasoning amplifies safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon called "Reasoning Tax". Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and don't constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks.

Method: The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K dataset with safety-critical cases; (II) safety-aware rollout with reflection and correction; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and penalties; (IV) GRPO optimization that reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories.

Result: SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance 70.13 and 78.97 on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing same-scale and >10× larger models. SaFeR-VLM-7B surpasses GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by 6.47 and 16.76 points respectively on safety metrics without degradation in helpfulness.

Conclusion: SaFeR-VLM shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning with robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.

Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep constrained clustering methods are limited by anchor dependencies in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embeddings, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes SpherePair loss with geometric formulation that encodes pairwise constraints and creates clustering-friendly embeddings in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.

Result: SpherePair outperforms state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes need for exact cluster count specification, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid cluster count inference, and has theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: SpherePair demonstrates superior performance, scalability, and real-world effectiveness compared to existing constrained clustering methods.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

*Iago Xabier Vázquez,Javier Sedano,Muhammad Afzal,Ángel Miguel García-Vico*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Spiking Neural Network-based method called Vacuum Spiker algorithm for energy-efficient anomaly detection in time series, using global neural activity changes instead of reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for anomaly detection consume high energy, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments like IoT devices, edge computing, and wearables.

Method: Proposes Vacuum Spiker algorithm with: 1) new detection criterion based on global neural activity changes, 2) Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity training to induce activity changes during anomalies, 3) efficient encoding scheme discretizing input space into non-overlapping intervals with single spike per time step.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on public datasets while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to deep learning and machine learning baselines. Successfully identifies power curtailment events in real-world solar inverter case study.

Conclusion: The method shows potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

TL;DR: LLMs can autonomously generate effective and interpretable machine learning pipelines for classification tasks, achieving high predictive performance and explainability metrics comparable to manually engineered solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the explainability capabilities of large language models when used to autonomously generate machine learning solutions, examining whether LLMs can produce interpretable ML pipelines.

Method: Used three state-of-the-art LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek) to design training pipelines for four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM) on binary and multilabel classification tasks. Evaluated using predictive metrics (recall, precision, F1-score) and SHAP explainability metrics (fidelity and sparsity).

Result: LLMs produced effective and interpretable models with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely matching manually engineered baselines in both predictive performance and explainability.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential as automated tools for generating interpretable ML pipelines, demonstrating capability to produce solutions comparable to human-engineered approaches.

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions.
We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely
matching manually engineered baselines.

*Ke Guo,Haochen Liu,Xiaojun Wu,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecompGAIL addresses instability in multi-agent traffic simulation by decomposing realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering irrelevant interactions and adding social PPO for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning approaches fail to model realistic traffic behaviors - behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while GAIL is unstable in multi-agent settings due to irrelevant interaction misguidance.

Method: Proposes Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL) that explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filters misleading neighbor interactions, and introduces social PPO with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark when integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone.

Conclusion: DecompGAIL successfully addresses multi-agent instability in traffic simulation by decomposing realism components and incorporating social rewards, enabling more realistic traffic behavior modeling.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

### [172] [Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940)
*Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri,Or Feldman,Moshe Eliasof,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAViS is a novel node affinity prediction model that uses virtual states and a new loss function to outperform both state-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks and simple heuristics like Persistent Forecast and Moving Average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal graph neural networks underperform simple heuristics for node affinity prediction tasks, revealing challenges in training these models effectively for this specific application.

Method: Developed NAViS (Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State) by exploiting equivalence between heuristics and state space models, and introduced a novel loss function specifically designed for node affinity prediction.

Result: NAViS outperforms state-of-the-art models and heuristics on TGB benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in node affinity prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed NAViS model successfully addresses training challenges in temporal graph neural networks for node affinity prediction and achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

*Lorenzo Pastori,Veronika Eyring,Mierk Schwabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how Fisher information matrix-based metrics predict quantum neural network performance, showing that higher effective dimension benefits unbiased models while lower effective dimension helps biased models during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in quantum machine learning and quantum neural networks, with a focus on understanding how evaluation metrics based on Fisher information matrix can predict training and prediction performance.

Method: Exploit equivalence between QNNs and Fourier models, derive analytical expression of FIM for Fourier models, identify features controlling effective dimension, construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and introduce tensor network representation.

Result: For unbiased models, higher effective dimension leads to better trainability and performance; for biased models, lower effective dimension is beneficial during training. Analytical FIM expression derived and effective dimension features identified.

Conclusion: Findings demonstrate explicit interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, providing insights relevant for broader machine learning community beyond quantum applications.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grouped Differential Attention (GDA) improves Transformer efficiency by using unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving and noise-control groups, allowing more heads for signal extraction and fewer for noise control with controlled repetition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of self-attention which allocates substantial attention to redundant/noisy context, and to address the rigid constraints of previous Differential Attention that required balanced head allocation.

Method: Proposes GDA with unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving and noise-control groups, using controlled repetition for noise-control heads (similar to GQA), and extends to group-differentiated growth for selective expansion of signal-focused heads.

Result: Moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines in large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments.

Conclusion: Ratio-aware head allocation and selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

*Zheng-An Chen,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of linearized Transformer training dynamics reveals a two-stage process: initial asymmetric weight perturbations enable escape from small initialization, followed by key-query matrix condensation leading to rank collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental principles of transformer training dynamics beyond configuration-specific studies, inspired by improved reasoning capabilities under small initialization scales.

Method: Employ gradient flow analytical framework to systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics, dissecting attention module dynamics into two distinct stages.

Result: First stage: asymmetric weight perturbations sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics enabling escape from small initialization. Second stage: key-query matrices actively participate, driving normalized matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse.

Conclusion: The two-stage framework generalizes classical directional convergence results and provides systematic understanding of Transformer training dynamics.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

### [176] [High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06955)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixout is proposed as a lightweight alternative to ensembling for domain generalization, using high masking probabilities to swap fine-tuned weights with pre-trained counterparts, achieving similar performance to ensembles with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensembling fine-tuned models improves robustness under distribution shifts but is computationally expensive. Dropout can disrupt critical representations in pre-trained models, creating a need for better regularization techniques.

Method: Mixout probabilistically swaps fine-tuned weights with pre-trained counterparts during training. High masking probabilities (0.9 for ViTs, 0.8 for ResNets) are used to penalize deviations from pre-trained parameters and reduce computational overhead.

Result: High-rate Mixout achieves comparable out-of-domain accuracy to ensemble methods across five benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, DomainNet) while reducing gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%.

Conclusion: Mixout with high masking rates provides an effective and efficient alternative to ensembling for domain generalization, balancing adaptation and retention of pre-trained knowledge while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMixout is an improved stochastic regularization method that replaces fixed weight anchors with adaptive moving-average snapshots and regulates masking frequency, enhancing both in-domain accuracy and robustness under distribution shift without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning vision foundation models improves in-domain accuracy but reduces robustness under distribution shift. The paper aims to address this trade-off by improving Mixout regularization.

Method: GMixout replaces fixed anchors with exponential moving-average snapshots that adapt during training, regulates masking period via explicit resampling-frequency hyperparameter, and uses sparse-kernel implementation for efficient training.

Result: GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance and surpasses both Model Soups and parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GMixout provides an effective approach to maintain robustness while improving accuracy through adaptive stochastic regularization, enabling training on consumer-grade GPUs without inference overhead.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spiral technique for data science lifecycles in business, emphasizing versatility, agility and iterative approaches for projects with clear end goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data science lifecycles are often depicted as linear or cyclical models that can be restarted after completion, but businesses need more agile and versatile approaches for projects with clear objectives.

Method: Proposes a new spiral technique that incorporates iterative approaches to data science lifecycles, focusing on versatility and agility in business processes.

Result: The spiral technique provides a more flexible framework for implementing data science lifecycles in business contexts where clear end goals exist.

Conclusion: The spiral technique offers an improved approach to data science lifecycles that better addresses the needs of modern businesses seeking productivity and competitiveness through more agile and iterative processes.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data
science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their
competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important
contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are
involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or
cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible
in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

### [179] [Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07018)
*Dung Hoang-Anh,Cuong Pham Trung Le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot quantization method that considers model sharpness during synthetic data generation to improve generalization, using gradient matching between reconstruction loss gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous zero-shot quantization approaches don't consider the sharpness of quantized models, despite the known relationship between low sharpness and better generalization in neural networks.

Method: The method minimizes sharpness by maximizing gradient matching between reconstruction loss gradients on synthetic and real validation data, approximated through gradient matching between generated samples and their neighbors when real validation data is unavailable.

Result: Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

Conclusion: Considering quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation enhances generalization in zero-shot quantization, with the proposed gradient matching approach proving effective.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness and realistic evaluation challenges in Federated Unlearning (FU), proposing FedCCCU as a fairness-aware solution that outperforms existing methods under realistic data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning requires unlearning for data deletion rights, but current approaches overlook fairness and use unrealistic synthetic data benchmarks, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), a fairness-aware approach that explicitly addresses both fairness and realistic data heterogeneity challenges in federated unlearning.

Result: Experimental results show existing FU methods perform poorly under realistic settings, while FedCCCU consistently outperforms them in both fairness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: FedCCCU provides a practical and scalable solution for real-world federated unlearning that addresses fairness concerns and works effectively under realistic data heterogeneity conditions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexMol is a flexible molecular pre-training framework that learns unified representations from 2D and 3D molecular data, supporting single-modality input during inference even when trained with incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data for training, which limits their applicability when certain modalities are unavailable or computationally expensive to generate.

Method: Uses separate models for 2D and 3D data with parameter sharing, employs a decoder to generate features for missing modalities, and implements a multistage continuous learning process for collaborative training.

Result: Achieves superior performance across various molecular property prediction tasks and demonstrates effectiveness with incomplete data.

Conclusion: FlexMol provides a robust framework for molecular representation learning that overcomes the limitations of requiring paired 2D-3D data, enabling flexible deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

TL;DR: COMPASS is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on realistic travel planning tasks, focusing on constrained preference optimization and multi-service coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM agents need to master strategic tool use and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions for complex planning tasks, but current benchmarks don't adequately measure these capabilities.

Method: Created a travel planning benchmark with realistic database covering 20 U.S. National Parks (transportation, accommodation, ticketing) and comprehensive tool ecosystem mirroring commercial booking platforms. Cast travel planning as constrained preference optimization problem.

Result: Evaluation revealed two critical gaps: (1) acceptable-optimal gap - agents meet constraints but fail to optimize preferences, (2) plan-coordination gap - performance collapses on multi-service coordination tasks, especially for open-source models.

Conclusion: COMPASS provides a practical benchmark that directly measures agents' ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Motivation: To develop an efficient speech emotion recognition system that doesn't require expensive GPU resources while maintaining competitive performance through automated hyperparameter optimization.

Method: Fine-tuned SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model on IEMOCAP, then compared Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators for hyperparameter tuning on German EmoDB corpus with a 15-trial budget.

Result: GP-BO achieved 0.96 balanced class accuracy in 11 minutes, TPE achieved 0.97 in 15 minutes, both significantly outperforming grid search (143 trials, 1680 minutes) and AutoSpeech 2020 baseline (0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU). Cross-lingual generalization showed improvements of 0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS.

Conclusion: Efficient hyperparameter optimization with pre-trained encoders enables competitive speech emotion recognition performance on commodity CPUs, making the technology more accessible without requiring expensive GPU hardware.

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

*Manshika Charvi Bissessur,Efimia Panagiotaki,Daniele De Martini*

TL;DR: The paper investigates how semantics affect localization performance and robustness in a self-supervised contrastive semantic localization framework, showing that the model learns noise-robust semantic relationships for explainable place recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how semantics influence localization performance and robustness, and whether models filter environmental noise while prioritizing distinctive landmarks over routine clutter.

Method: Trained a localization network on original and perturbed maps, conducted post-hoc introspection analysis using various interpretability methods including integrated gradients and attention weights, and performed semantic class ablation.

Result: Integrated gradients and attention weights were the most reliable probes of learned behavior. Semantic class ablation revealed implicit weighting where frequent objects are often down-weighted.

Conclusion: The model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relationships about place definition, enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

### [185] [Blind Construction of Angular Power Maps in Massive MIMO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07071)
*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised angular power map construction using massive MIMO CSI data without location labels, employing HMM to connect mobile trajectory with CSI evolution for location estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio map approaches require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging to obtain in practice. This work addresses the need for unsupervised methods to construct radio maps using only CSI measurements.

Method: Built a hidden Markov model (HMM) to connect mobile trajectory with CSI evolution in massive MIMO channels. Used this to estimate mobile locations and construct angular power maps from large timescale CSI data without location labels.

Result: Under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed BSs, CRLB for localization error can vanish at any SNR. With BSs in limited regions, error remains nonzero even with infinite measurements. Real-world RSRP data achieved 18m average localization error using mainly single serving cell measurements.

Conclusion: Unsupervised angular power map construction is feasible using massive MIMO CSI data without location labels, with HMM-based approach enabling practical radio map deployment in real networks.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HTMformer introduces Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME) to enhance Transformer-based time series forecasting by extracting richer multidimensional features, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformers for time series forecasting overemphasize temporal dependencies without corresponding performance gains, and their performance heavily depends on embedding methods for effective sequence representations.

Method: Proposed HTME extractor that integrates lightweight temporal feature extraction with multivariate feature extraction to create multidimensional embeddings, combined with Transformer architecture to form HTMformer.

Result: Experiments on eight real-world datasets show HTMformer outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: HTMformer successfully addresses limitations of existing Transformers by enhancing feature extraction through hybrid embeddings, achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [187] [Non-Stationary Online Structured Prediction with Surrogate Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07086)
*Shinsaku Sakaue,Han Bao,Yuzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online structured prediction in non-stationary environments by proving a bound on cumulative target loss that depends on comparator's surrogate loss and path length, rather than time horizon T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surrogate regret bounds break down in non-stationary environments where fixed estimators incur linear loss growth with time horizon T, necessitating new approaches for dynamic environments.

Method: Synthesizes dynamic regret bound of online gradient descent (OGD) with surrogate gap exploitation technique, and introduces a new Polyak-style learning rate for OGD that provides target-loss guarantees.

Result: Proves a bound of form F_T + C(1 + P_T) on cumulative target loss, where F_T is comparator's cumulative surrogate loss, P_T is its path length, and C is constant. This bound is tight and extends to broader problems via convolutional Fenchel-Young loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides stronger guarantees in non-stationary environments by bounding target loss in terms of comparator's surrogate loss and path length rather than time horizon, with tight dependence on these parameters.

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective world models that can predict future visual observations or latent states for real-world humanoid interaction tasks.

Method: For sampling track: adapted Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B video generation model with AdaLN-Zero conditioning on robot states and LoRA post-training. For compression track: trained Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.

Result: Achieved 23.0 dB PSNR in sampling task and Top-500 CE of 6.6386 in compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches successfully address both sampling and compression tasks in the world model benchmark, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in predicting future observations for humanoid interaction.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to
reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent
states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of
real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling,
focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on
predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the
video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned
future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the
compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.
Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-asymptotic bounds on prediction set length deviation for conformalized quantile and median regression, capturing joint dependence on training size, calibration size, and miscoverage level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treats miscoverage level α as fixed, but efficiency of conformal prediction depends on α. Need to understand how prediction set length deviates from oracle interval length across different α regimes.

Method: Analyze conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD under mild data distribution assumptions. Establish bounds on prediction set length deviation from oracle interval length.

Result: Derived bounds of order O(1/√n + 1/(α²n) + 1/√m + exp(-α²m)) that capture joint dependence on training size n, calibration size m, and miscoverage level α. Identified phase transitions in convergence rates across α regimes.

Conclusion: Results provide guidance for data allocation to control excess prediction set length. Empirical findings align with theoretical predictions, offering practical insights for conformal prediction efficiency optimization.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPMM-CFL is a nonparametric Bayesian CFL method that automatically infers the number of clusters and client assignments using Dirichlet Process priors, eliminating the need to pre-specify cluster count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most CFL methods require fixing the number of clusters K beforehand, which is impractical when the latent cluster structure is unknown in real-world federated learning scenarios.

Method: Places a Dirichlet Process prior over cluster parameter distributions to enable joint inference of cluster count and client assignments while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives, coupling federated updates with cluster inferences each round.

Result: Validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions, showing effective performance without requiring pre-specified cluster count.

Conclusion: DPMM-CFL provides a practical solution for CFL by automatically determining the appropriate number of clusters through nonparametric Bayesian inference, addressing the limitation of fixed cluster specifications in existing methods.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

*Arshika Lalan,Rajat Ghosh,Aditya Kolsur,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stateful multi-agent evolutionary search framework improves unit test generation by combining persistent inference-time state, adversarial mutation, and evolutionary preservation to generate robust edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stateless inference struggles with multi-step tasks due to lack of persistent state, and task-specific fine-tuning achieves only surface-level code generation but fails on deeper reasoning tasks with long-horizon dependencies.

Method: Training-free framework with persistent inference-time state, adversarial mutation, and evolutionary preservation. Uses specialized agents to sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates, with a controller maintaining persistent state across generations.

Result: Achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines on HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini benchmarks using Llama, Gemma, and GPT LLMs. Generates robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases.

Conclusion: Combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation, yielding a generalist agent capable of discovering robust edge cases.

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

*Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELMUR is a transformer architecture with structured external memory that enables long-term dependency handling in partially observable environments, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic agents need to handle partial observability and long horizons where key information appears long before decisions, but current approaches struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies due to context window limitations and memory scaling issues.

Method: ELMUR uses a transformer architecture with structured external memory where each layer maintains memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and updates them through an LRU memory module using replacement or convex blending.

Result: ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000 times beyond attention windows, achieves 100% success on synthetic T-Maze tasks with million-step corridors, outperforms baselines on more than half of POPGym tasks, and nearly doubles performance on MIKASA-Robo sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Structured, layer-local external memory provides a simple and scalable approach for decision making under partial observability, effectively handling long-term dependencies in complex environments.

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

TL;DR: Bridged Clustering is a semi-supervised framework that learns predictors from unpaired X and Y datasets by clustering them independently and learning sparse bridges between clusters using few paired examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage output-only data in semi-supervised learning while maintaining interpretability and sparsity, unlike traditional SSL methods and dense transport-based approaches.

Method: Clusters X and Y independently, learns sparse interpretable bridges between clusters using minimal paired examples, and predicts by assigning new inputs to nearest input clusters and returning linked output cluster centroids.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows effectiveness with bounded mis-clustering/mis-bridging rates. Empirical results show competitiveness with SOTA methods while being simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering provides an effective, efficient, and interpretable semi-supervised learning framework that explicitly leverages output-only data and maintains sparse alignments.

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poisoning attacks require only a near-constant number of malicious documents (around 250) to compromise LLMs, regardless of model size or dataset scale, making backdoor injection easier than previously believed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing poisoning research assumes adversaries control a percentage of training data, but for large models this translates to impractically large amounts of data. This work challenges that assumption by showing poisoning requires constant document counts.

Method: Conducted largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, training models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). Also ran smaller-scale experiments to test factors like poisoned-to-clean data ratios and non-random poison distributions.

Result: 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all sizes, despite largest models training on 20x more clean data. Same dynamics observed for fine-tuning poisoning.

Conclusion: Backdoor injection through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously thought, as poison count doesn't scale with model size, highlighting urgent need for better defenses.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

*Joris Dommel,Sven A. Wegner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the approximation of a specific counterexample function using ReLU neural networks with widths w=n and w=n+1, examining how depth affects approximation quality and identifying dying neurons as a key factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the boundary case of neural network width requirements (w>n) for universal approximation, specifically examining how networks perform when w equals n or n+1, and to understand the role of depth and dying neurons in approximation behavior.

Method: The authors approximate the counterexample function from Hanin and Sellke's work using ReLU neural networks with widths w=n and w=n+1. They systematically vary the network depth and analyze the resulting approximation quality, focusing on the phenomenon of dying neurons.

Result: The study reveals that neural networks can approximate the counterexample function even when w=n and w=n+1, but the approximation quality depends on depth. Dying neurons are identified as a key factor influencing the approximation behavior.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that while w>n is theoretically necessary for universal approximation, practical approximation of specific functions is possible even at the threshold widths w=n and w=n+1, with depth and dying neurons playing crucial roles in determining approximation quality.

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

*Fangshuo Liao,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with non-linear routers and experts, showing feature learning and parameter recovery in a student-teacher framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use of MoE architectures in modern AI systems, theoretical understanding of their training dynamics remains limited to simplified scenarios like separate expert-router optimization or top-1 routing with carefully constructed datasets.

Method: The authors analyze joint training of soft-routed MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework, using moderate over-parameterization and proving convergence through feature learning phases.

Result: The analysis shows that with moderate over-parameterization, the student network undergoes a feature learning phase where the router is guided by experts to recover teacher parameters, and post-training pruning followed by fine-tuning reaches global optimality.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical analysis offering novel insights into the optimization landscape of MoE architectures, establishing convergence guarantees for joint training with non-linear components.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

*Yanlin Qu,Hongseok Namkoong,Assaf Zeevi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling is recast as an online optimization algorithm using 'faithful' stationarization, revealing its exploration-exploitation balance mechanism through a regularized greedy policy structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the exact mechanism through which Thompson Sampling balances exploration and exploitation, which remains mysterious despite its widespread use and theoretical guarantees.

Method: Introduces 'faithful' stationarization to convert finite horizon dynamic optimization into a stationary counterpart, then applies Bellman's principle to derive a time-invariant optimal policy structure.

Result: Thompson Sampling is shown to have a simple online optimization form that mimics Bellman-optimal policy, with greediness regularized by residual uncertainty measured through point-biserial correlation.

Conclusion: This reveals how Thompson Sampling balances exploration-exploitation and provides a principled framework to study and improve upon Thompson's original idea.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

### [198] [Discriminative Feature Feedback with General Teacher Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07245)
*Omri Bar Oz,Tosca Lechner,Sivan Sabato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first systematic theoretical analysis of Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF), characterizing mistake bounds in both realizable and non-realizable settings and revealing fundamental differences from classical online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for DFF learning protocol and understand how discriminative feature explanations as feedback differ from traditional learning settings, particularly in comparison to supervised and online learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a general framework comparable to classical protocols, introducing new notions of dimension to characterize mistake bounds, and proving upper and lower bounds for both realizable and non-realizable settings.

Result: Characterized the mistake bound in realizable setting using a new dimension concept, provided a tight mistake upper bound for non-realizable setting, and showed that unlike online learning, the realizable dimension doesn't characterize non-realizable performance or no-regret algorithm existence in DFF.

Conclusion: DFF exhibits fundamentally different theoretical properties from online learning, requiring new analytical tools and dimensions to characterize its performance, particularly highlighting the insufficiency of realizable dimension for understanding non-realizable behavior in richer feedback settings.

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

*Evgenii Opryshko,Junwei Quan,Claas Voelcker,Yilun Du,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTGS is a test-time planning method that improves offline goal-conditioned RL by using graph search to find subgoal sequences, requiring no training changes or additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline GCRL struggles with long-horizon decision making due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, which are amplified in the offline setting.

Method: TTGS builds a weighted graph over dataset states and performs fast search to assemble subgoal sequences that a frozen policy executes, using either learned value functions or state-space distances.

Result: On OGBench benchmark, TTGS improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Simple metric-guided test-time planning effectively enhances offline GCRL performance without requiring training modifications or additional supervision.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

### [200] [Dynamic Regret Bounds for Online Omniprediction with Long Term Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07266)
*Yahav Bechavod,Jiuyao Lu,Aaron Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An algorithm for online omniprediction with dynamic regret bounds and long-term constraints, ensuring all downstream decision makers get worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide predictions that enable multiple downstream decision makers with different utility and constraint functions to select actions that guarantee worst-case utility while minimizing constraint violations, without requiring the agents to maintain state.

Method: An online learning algorithm that generates predictions broadcast to downstream decision makers, who then solve one-round constrained optimization problems based on these predictions to select actions.

Result: The first algorithm that obtains simultaneous dynamic regret guarantees for all agents (measured against changing action sequences) while ensuring vanishing constraint violation for each agent.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves dynamic regret bounds and constraint satisfaction for online omniprediction with long-term constraints, without requiring state maintenance by the agents.

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Qi Hu,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTCN-G is a novel deep learning framework that integrates gated temporal convolutional networks with graph neural networks and residual learning to address class imbalance in intrusion detection systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in intrusion detection systems caused by network threat complexity and class imbalance in traffic data, while synergistically integrating temporal and topological modeling capabilities.

Method: Combines Gated TCN for hierarchical temporal feature extraction from network flows with GCN for graph structure learning, integrated with residual learning via Graph Attention Network to preserve original features and mitigate class imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT datasets show GTCN-G achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in both binary and multi-class classification.

Conclusion: The proposed GTCN-G framework effectively addresses class imbalance and integrates temporal and structural modeling for superior intrusion detection performance.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

### [202] [Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286)
*Jigang Fan,Xiaoran Jiao,Shengdong Lin,Zhanming Liang,Weian Mao,Chenchen Jing,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoIF is a lightweight protein fitness prediction model that combines within-family evolutionary profiles from homologs with cross-family structural constraints from inverse folding, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein fitness prediction is limited by the gap between available assays and the vast size of sequence space. Protein language models show promise but need better integration of evolutionary signals.

Method: EvoIF integrates two evolutionary signals: within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints from inverse folding logits, using a compact transition block to fuse sequence-structure representations.

Result: On ProteinGym (217 assays, >2.5M mutants), EvoIF achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance using only 0.15% of training data and fewer parameters than large models. The two evolutionary profiles are complementary and improve robustness.

Conclusion: EvoIF provides an efficient framework for protein fitness prediction by effectively combining complementary evolutionary signals, demonstrating that lightweight models can outperform larger ones when properly integrating evolutionary information.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

*Xingtong Yu,Chang Zhou,Xinming Zhang,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolGA adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to molecular applications by incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge through molecular alignment and conditional adaptation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained 2D graph encoders overlook rich molecular domain knowledge associated with submolecular instances, and existing molecular pre-training approaches lack flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge types.

Method: Proposes molecular alignment strategy to bridge pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations, and conditional adaptation mechanism that generates instance-specific tokens for fine-grained knowledge integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on eleven public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MolGA.

Conclusion: MolGA provides a practical approach to reuse pre-trained 2D encoders while flexibly incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream adaptation.

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Smith is an automated multi-agent pipeline that transforms raw datasets into machine learning engineering challenges, addressing the scalability limitations of manually curated MLE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLE benchmarks are limited by low scalability and manual curation efforts, making it difficult to acquire high-quality training data for machine learning engineering tasks.

Method: A fully automated multi-agent pipeline using generate-verify-execute paradigm with structured task design, standardized refactoring, and hybrid verification (structural rules + semantic soundness) plus interactive execution for empirical validation.

Result: Successfully generated 606 MLE tasks from 224 real-world datasets across multiple categories, objectives, and modalities. Evaluation showed strong correlation between LLM performance on MLE-Smith tasks and human-designed tasks.

Conclusion: MLE-Smith effectively scales up MLE task generation while maintaining quality, as demonstrated by the strong correlation with human-designed benchmarks.

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning using only existing short-horizon data by synthetically composing simple problems into complex multi-step chains and training with outcome-only rewards under an automatic complexity curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on short-horizon reasoning tasks but struggle with longer reasoning chains, and existing approaches require costly step-level supervision or inference-time scaffolding that doesn't scale well.

Method: Synthetically compose simple problems into complex multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length, then train models using outcome-only rewards under an automatic curriculum that increases complexity, enabling scalable RL training without saturation.

Result: Curriculum training on composed 6th-grade math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x, with long-horizon improvements significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient path for scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data, achieving exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training with training signal comparable to dense supervision.

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve weak signal detection performance under challenging noise conditions (additive and multiplicative Gaussian noise) while addressing practical constraints like bandwidth limitations and error-prone channels.

Method: Derived a locally most powerful test-based hybrid detector from compound observations, optimized sensor-wise quantization thresholds, and used mixed-integer linear programming for bandwidth allocation optimization.

Result: The proposed hybrid detector and bandwidth allocation strategy show superior performance, particularly in error-prone channel conditions, achieving near-optimal asymptotic detection performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid detector with optimized quantization and bandwidth allocation effectively addresses weak signal detection challenges in constrained environments with noise and bandwidth limitations.

Abstract: A hybrid detector that fuses both quantized and full-precision observations
is proposed for weak signal detection under additive and multiplicative
Gaussian noise. We first derive a locally most powerful test (LMPT)--based
hybrid detector from the composite probability distribution of the compound
observations received by the fusion center, and then analyze its asymptotic
detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the sensor-wise quantization
thresholds to achieve near-optimal asymptotic performance at the local sensor
level. Moreover, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming approach to
solve the optimization problem of transmission bandwidth allocation accounting
for bandwidth constraints and error-prone channels. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid detector and the bandwidth
allocation strategy, especially in challenging error-prone channel conditions.

performance benefits across other metrics. These improvements show significant
benefits when integrated with power forecasting tools and show that the
approach provides an additional tool for accuracy checking for system planning
and resource allocation in times of need for resource allocation in electric
power systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-static cooperative sensing can enhance sensing accuracy and range in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, addressing the need for improved performance in coexisting downlink and uplink communications.

Method: Uses alternating optimization (AO) with SCA-based and penalty-based algorithms for beamforming, and fractional programming (FP) for receive filters and UL power optimization, tackling the non-convex problem through decomposition.

Result: Numerical results show performance improvement of the proposed JAPS scheme and effectiveness of the developed algorithms in meeting both communication and sensing requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed JAPS framework and optimization algorithms successfully enable cooperative multi-static ISAC with enhanced sensing capabilities while maintaining communication performance.

Abstract: Multi-static cooperative sensing emerges as a promising technology for
advancing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enhancing sensing
accuracy and range. In this paper, we develop a unified design framework for
joint active and passive sensing (JAPS). In particular, we consider a JAPSbased
cooperative multi-static ISAC system for coexisting downlink (DL) and uplink
(UL) communications. An optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the
sum rate of both the DL and UL transmissions via jointly optimizing
beamforming, receive filters and power allocation, while guaranteeing the
sensing requirements and transmission power constraints. However, the
formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to
solve directly due to the tight coupling among optimization variables. To
tackle this complicated issue, we employ an efficient algorithm architecture
leveraging alternating optimization (AO). Specifically, with the given receive
filters and transmission power for UL communication, the transmit beamforming
subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation (SCA)-based and
penalty-based algorithms. A fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm is
developed to tackle the receive filters and transmission power for UL
communication optimization subproblem. Extensive numerical results validate the
performance improvement of our proposed JAPS scheme and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard FL methods treat all clients uniformly, which is insufficient for ISAC systems with competing communication and sensing objectives that require dynamic adaptation to application-specific trade-offs.

Method: EM-based PFL framework where each BS computes an EM posterior to quantify suitability between global and local models based on losses, enabling adaptive aggregation weight determination.

Result: Outperforms existing PFL baselines (FedPer, pFedMe) with faster convergence and better multi-objective performance in both objective-wise homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed EM-based PFL framework effectively handles multi-objective optimization in ISAC systems by enabling BSs to dynamically adapt to competing objectives through adaptive aggregation weights.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-based (EM) Personalized
Federated Learning (PFL) framework for multi-objective optimization (MOO) in
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. In contrast to standard
federated learning (FL) methods that handle all clients uniformly, the proposed
approach enables each base station (BS) to adaptively determine its aggregation
weight with the EM algorithm. Specifically, an EM posterior is computed at each
BS to quantify the relative suitability between the global and each local
model, based on the losses of models on their respective datasets. The proposed
method is especially valuable in scenarios with competing communication and
sensing objectives, as it enables BSs to dynamically adapt to
application-specific trade-offs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, we conduct simulation studies under both objective-wise homogeneous
and heterogeneous conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing PFL baselines, such as FedPer and pFedMe, achieving faster
convergence and better multi-objective performance.

Motivation: Need for low complexity error correction codes to enable next-generation ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) in 6G networks.

Method: Leverages properties of dual codewords with flexible weights to provide decoding information for error locations and magnitudes. Two schemes: one uses intrinsic information for iterative decoding, another combines prior channel information with intrinsic information.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the validness of the proposed approach. Both schemes use vector multiplication and real-number comparisons for easy hardware implementation.

Conclusion: The dual codeword-based decoding schemes provide higher reliability performance and are suitable for hardware implementation in 6G xURLLC systems.

Abstract: Low complexity error correction code is a key enabler for next generation

Method: Uses mmWave signals for joint sensing and communication, with a hybrid framework that adaptively selects Extended Kalman filter for pedestrian speeds and Unscented Kalman filter for vehicular speeds. Incorporates adaptive noise scaling, chi-square gating, and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing to mitigate data-association problems and estimation errors.

Result: Demonstrated roughly 30-60% improvement across various metrics including Absolute Trajectory Error, Relative Pose Error, Normalized Estimated Error Squared, and Root Mean Square Error compared to existing approaches tailored to either indoor or static settings.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid mobility-aware adaptive framework effectively addresses speed-dependent localization challenges and outperforms existing methods, making it suitable for energy-efficient and ultra-reliable low latency applications in next generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Precise user localization and tracking enhances energy-efficient and
ultra-reliable low latency applications in the next generation wireless
networks. In addition to computational complexity and data association
challenges with Kalman-filter localization techniques, estimation errors tend
to grow as the user's trajectory speed increases. By exploiting mmWave signals
for joint sensing and communication, our approach dispenses with additional
sensors adopted in most techniques while retaining high resolution spatial
cues. We present a hybrid mobility-aware adaptive framework that selects the
Extended Kalman filter at pedestrian speed and the Unscented Kalman filter at
vehicular speed. The scheme mitigates data-association problem and estimation
errors through adaptive noise scaling, chi-square gating, Rauch-Tung-Striebel
smoothing. Evaluations using Absolute Trajectory Error, Relative Pose Error,
Normalized Estimated Error Squared and Root Mean Square Error metrics
demonstrate roughly 30-60% improvement in their respective regimes indicating a
clear advantage over existing approaches tailored to either indoor or static

Result: 47.6% reduction in average reconstruction error, exceptional generalization to unseen environments with up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles, while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: Evo-WISVA establishes foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management and advances predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions,
particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a
foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
(URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based
or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities
introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart
warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless
Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep
learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital
twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory
Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal
forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized
end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment
between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental
evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse
dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error.
Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen
environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously
moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency
essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational
technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous
optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in
industrial communication networks.

*Eren Berk Kama,Murat Babek Salman,Isaac Skog,Emil Björnson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A sensing management method for ISAC in cell-free massive MIMO that uses predictive beamforming based on user tracking to reduce channel estimation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional channel estimation procedures consume significant resources during data transmission, creating overhead that reduces available resources for actual data transmission.

Method: State-based approach using extended Kalman filter (EKF) tracking with adaptive sensing management to track users when no communication is requested, enabling predictive beamforming when communication requests arrive.

Result: Simulation results show uniform downlink communication rates higher than existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive beamforming.

Conclusion: The proposed sensing management approach effectively reduces channel estimation overhead and improves communication performance in ISAC systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation
procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming
resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge,
we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track
the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication
request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position,
thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an
extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing
management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high
tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing
management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are
higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive
beamforming.

*Ruifeng Gao,Hao Zhang,Jue Wang,Ye Li,Yingdong Hu,Qiuming Zhu,Shu Sun,Meixia Tao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel framework for ship-to-shore data transmission that optimizes ship trajectory using evaporation duct channel gain information to minimize both transmission and sailing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evaporation duct effect enables long-range maritime transmissions, but how to effectively utilize it for efficient communication design remains unexplored, particularly in ship-to-shore data transmission scenarios.

Method: Proposed a framework exploiting priori channel gain map information in evaporation duct, formulated multi-objective optimization problem, and solved it using dynamic population PSO-integrated NSGA-II algorithm.

Result: Simulations show the proposed scheme effectively reduces both data transmission time and sailing time compared to benchmark schemes that ignore evaporation duct information.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages evaporation duct channel characteristics to optimize maritime communication efficiency, demonstrating significant performance improvements over conventional approaches.

Abstract: In maritime wireless networks, the evaporation duct effect has been known as
a preferable condition for long-range transmissions. However, how to
effectively utilize the duct effect for efficient communication design is still
open for investigation. In this paper, we consider a typical scenario of
ship-to-shore data transmission, where a ship collects data from multiple
oceanographic buoys, sails from one to another, and transmits the collected
data back to a terrestrial base station during its voyage. A novel framework,
which exploits priori information of the channel gain map in the presence of
evaporation duct, is proposed to minimize the data transmission time and the
sailing time by optimizing the ship's trajectory. To this end, a
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and is further solved by a
dynamic population PSO-integrated NSGA-II algorithm. Through simulations, it is
demonstrated that, compared to the benchmark scheme which ignores useful
information of the evaporation duct, the proposed scheme can effectively reduce
both the data transmission time and the sailing time.

*Yinong Chen,Wenchi Cheng,Jingqing Wang,Xiao Zheng,Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A performance modeling framework for satellite-aerial-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) using Fisher-Snedecor F composite fading model to characterize air-ground links, with analysis of effective capacity, outage probability, and outage capacity under QoS constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies neglect complex channel conditions due to terrain changes or analyze performance without QoS constraints, creating a mismatch between theoretical analysis and practical performance in emergency wireless communications.

Method: Established a SAGIN performance modeling framework using Fisher-Snedecor F composite fading model to characterize multipath fading and shadowing in harsh ground environments. Developed exact distribution of end-to-end SNR statistics for space-air and air-ground links with AF and DF relaying protocols.

Result: Derived closed-form and asymptotic expressions for effective capacity with QoS provisioning, outage probability, and ε-outage capacity. Results were verified through field measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, showing close alignment with theoretical predictions in high-SNR regime.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the deficiencies in existing studies by accurately modeling complex channel conditions and QoS constraints, providing reliable performance analysis for SAGIN in emergency wireless communications scenarios.

Abstract: In emergency wireless communications (EWC) scenarios, ensuring reliable,
flexible, and high-rate transmission while simultaneously maintaining seamless
coverage and rapid response capabilities presents a critical technical
challenge. To this end, satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has
emerged as a promising solution due to its comprehensive three-dimensional
coverage and capability to meet stringent, multi-faceted quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements. Nevertheless, most existing studies either neglected the
inherent characteristics of the complex channel conditions due to the terrain
changes or analyzed the performance in the absence of QoS constraints,
resulting in a mismatch between theoretical analysis and practical performance.
To remedy such deficiencies, in this paper we establish a performance modeling
framework for SAGIN employing the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite
fading model to characterize the air-ground link. In specific, the proposed
$\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel is adopted to accurately describe both
multipath fading and shadowing in harsh ground environments. The exact
distribution of end-to-end signal-to-noise (SNR) statistics for space-air and
air-ground links is developed, enabling theoretical analysis of cascaded
channels with fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
relaying protocols, respectively. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of the
derived results are provided to offer concise representations and demonstrate
close alignment with theoretical predictions in the high-SNR regime. Finally,
the insightful closed-form and asymptotic expressions of effective capacity
with QoS provisioning, outage probability, and $\epsilon$-outage capacity are
investigated, respectively, followed by both field measurements and Monte Carlo
simulations to verify the effectiveness.

### [217] [Moments Matter: Posterior Recovery in Poisson Denoising via Log-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07199)
*Shirin Shoushtari,Edward P. Chandler,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a log-network for Poisson denoising that learns E[log x | y] instead of E[x | y], enabling posterior uncertainty estimation while maintaining denoising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MSE training for Poisson denoising only captures posterior mean but fails to estimate posterior uncertainty, limiting its usefulness in photon-limited imaging applications.

Method: Train a log-network to learn E[log x | y] rather than E[x | y], leveraging the logarithm as a natural parameterization for Poisson distribution to enable posterior moment recovery.

Result: Theoretical proof shows log-network can recover higher-order posterior moments; experiments on simulated data match MMSE denoising performance while providing posterior access.

Conclusion: The log-network approach successfully bridges the gap between denoising performance and posterior uncertainty estimation in Poisson noise scenarios.

Abstract: Poisson denoising plays a central role in photon-limited imaging applications
such as microscopy, astronomy, and medical imaging. It is common to train deep
learning models for denoising using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss, which
corresponds to computing the posterior mean $\mathbb{E}[x \mid y]$. When the
noise is Gaussian, Tweedie's formula enables approximation of the posterior
distribution through its higher-order moments. However, this connection no
longer holds for Poisson denoising: while $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $ still
minimizes MSE, it fails to capture posterior uncertainty. We propose a new
strategy for Poisson denoising based on training a log-network. Instead of
predicting the posterior mean $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $, the log-network is
trained to learn $\mathbb{E}[\log x \mid y]$, leveraging the logarithm as a
convenient parameterization for the Poisson distribution. We provide a
theoretical proof that the proposed log-network enables recovery of
higher-order posterior moments and thus supports posterior approximation.
Experiments on simulated data show that our method matches the denoising
performance of standard MMSE models while providing access to the posterior.

TL;DR: AlphaApollo is a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that uses multiple models with computation and retrieval tools to overcome foundation model limitations, achieving significant performance gains on AIME benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key bottlenecks in foundation model reasoning: limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration, by creating a system that orchestrates multiple models with professional tools.

Method: Orchestrates multiple models with computation tools (Python with numerical/symbolic libraries) and retrieval tools for task-relevant information, using a shared state map to record candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement.

Result: Consistent gains on AIME 2024/2025: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32 for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, +8.91% Average@32 and +26.67% Pass@32 for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Over 80% of tool calls successfully executed.

Conclusion: AlphaApollo effectively lifts the capability ceiling of foundation models through tool-assisted reasoning and multi-round solution evolution, demonstrating consistent outperformance over non-tool baselines.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool
baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework to define and measure AI reasoning ability, where models maintain performance on test instances requiring more complex solutions than training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI lacks clear definitions and metrics for reasoning ability, unlike learning where generalization concepts are well-established. There's a need to formalize what constitutes reasoning in AI systems.

Method: Formalizes complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (object/relation counts, reasoning step counts). Proposes Complexity OoD framework where models generalize to test instances requiring more complex solutions than training examples.

Result: Provides a unified lens connecting learning and reasoning: System1-like processing at low complexity becomes System2-like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures.

Conclusion: Progress toward robust reasoning requires architectures and training regimes that explicitly model computation with respect to complexity, as Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone.

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

TL;DR: BuilderBench is a benchmark for training AI agents to learn through open-ended exploration in a block-building environment, testing physics understanding, math skills, and long-term planning without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with novel problems beyond existing data limits. Agents need exploration skills to learn through experience, but scalable learning mechanisms for interactive agents remain an open challenge.

Method: Created BuilderBench with a hardware-accelerated simulator of robotic agents interacting with physical blocks, featuring 42 diverse target structures. Agents explore and learn without supervision during training, then build unseen structures during evaluation.

Result: The benchmark tasks challenge current algorithms, requiring embodied reasoning through actions and experimentation. A 'training wheels' protocol is provided for simpler evaluation, along with six algorithm implementations as reference points.

Conclusion: BuilderBench accelerates research into agent pre-training focused on open-ended exploration, addressing the need for scalable learning mechanisms that enable agents to solve novel problems through interaction and experience.

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods AMILI and AMILP for information system integration in post-merger integration have high learning curve and low learner motivation, creating a need for more engaging training approaches.

Method: Analyzes learning theories, cognitive load models, motivation models, and serious game design frameworks to develop requirements for a game-based learning framework with two components: transformation process and learning experience.

Result: Identified essential requirements for a tailored game-based learning design framework for information system integration training in post-merger contexts.

Conclusion: Proposes plan for iterative development and real-world validation of the game-based learning framework to improve training effectiveness.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

TL;DR: Proposes BCCS framework for stable consensus in multi-agent systems by selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating consensus judgment using system-internal beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus-seeking approaches rely on voting mechanisms that overlook contradictions in system-internal beliefs and use uniform collaboration, failing to achieve stable consensus.

Method: Developed theoretical framework for optimal collaborator selection, then implemented BCCS framework that selects optimal collaborators and calibrates consensus judgment using system-internal beliefs.

Result: Outperformed best existing results by 2.23% on MATH and 3.95% on MMLU benchmark datasets for challenging NLP tasks.

Conclusion: BCCS framework successfully addresses limitations of existing consensus-seeking methods by enabling stable consensus through optimal collaborator selection and belief-calibrated judgment.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at

### [223] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard solo-reasoning training fails to develop effective off-trajectory reasoning capabilities in LLMs, with stronger models being more fragile to distractions and all models struggling to leverage collaborators' reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether standard solo-reasoning training pipelines can deliver the off-trajectory reasoning behaviors needed for effective multi-model collaboration in shared reasoning trajectories.

Method: Proposed twin tests (Recoverability and Guidability) to evaluate off-trajectory reasoning, tested 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B), and conducted control studies on post-training factors including distillation teacher choice, RL usage, and data selection.

Result: Stronger LLMs on benchmarks are more fragile under distraction, all models fail to effectively leverage collaborators' reasoning (solve rates <9.2%), and suboptimal recoverability behaviors transfer from teachers to distilled students.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have significant limitations in off-trajectory reasoning, highlighting the need for specialized training approaches to enable effective multi-model collaboration in shared reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on representing food-health relationships in standardized, machine-readable formats using semantic web technologies, despite growing interest in 'food as medicine'.

Method: Used KNARM methodology to create a knowledge graph linking food and health by combining flavonoid data from USDA databases with cancer connections from literature.

Result: Developed a knowledge graph that represents food-health relationships in machine-operable format, serving as an example for researchers to explore dietary choices and disease management.

Conclusion: The knowledge graph provides a foundation for future work to expand scope, capture nuances, add more data, and perform inferences to uncover hidden relationships between food and health.

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex enables targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and generalization for foundation models, demonstrating the need for specialized benchmarks to assess complex cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation

PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and

TL;DR: Behavior Priming trains agentic search models by incorporating four key reasoning behaviors (Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, Error Recovery) through SFT followed by RL, achieving over 35% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic search introduces unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the web, requiring effective reasoning behavior patterns.

Method: Proposed a reasoning-driven LLM pipeline to analyze successful search trajectories, identified four beneficial reasoning behaviors, and developed Behavior Priming technique that synthesizes trajectories with these behaviors for SFT followed by RL.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, HLE) showed over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B. Desired reasoning behaviors in SFT data, not answer correctness, proved critical for strong RL performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning behaviors enable more effective exploration and test-time scaling capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. The approach demonstrates that behavioral patterns are more important than answer correctness for training effective agentic search models.

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: APE framework improves LLM judge reliability by automatically learning evaluation dimensions from failure cases and using confidence-based ensemble to selectively augment judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize implicit standards in human assessments, creating an evaluation gap.

Method: Propose Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) with adaptive framework that learns evaluation dimensions from failure cases and uses Collective Confidence estimation for confidence-based ensemble mechanism.

Result: APE improves GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in zero-shot setting, enhancing reliability across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: APE provides principled approach for LLM judges to leverage test-time computation and bridge evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

*Jingbo Yang,Bairu Hou,Wei Wei,Shiyu Chang,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART is a framework that enables a single LLM to handle complex web tasks by dynamically decomposing objectives into navigation, information extraction, and execution subtasks, with continuous replanning as new webpages are revealed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with complex web tasks requiring long horizon navigation, large scale information extraction, and reasoning under constraints, despite being competent at straightforward tasks.

Method: WebDART dynamically decomposes objectives into three focused subtasks (navigation, information extraction, execution) and continuously replans the decomposition as new webpages are revealed to take advantage of new filters/shortcuts and avoid redundant exploration.

Result: On WebChoreArena, WebDART improves success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA agents, matches their performance on easier WebArena suite, and completes tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

Conclusion: WebDART provides an effective framework for handling complex web tasks through dynamic task decomposition and continuous replanning, significantly outperforming existing approaches on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EICL improves fine-grained emotion recognition by addressing limitations of In-Context Learning (ICL) through emotionally similar examples and a two-stage decision-making process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL methods enhance reasoning but overlook decision-making in emotion recognition. Semantically similar examples often introduce emotional discrepancies that cause errors.

Method: Proposes Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) with emotionally similar examples, dynamic soft-label strategy for better query representations, and two-stage exclusion strategy for multi-angle similarity assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments show EICL significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: EICL effectively addresses emotional discrepancies in ICL and improves both reasoning and decision-making processes in fine-grained emotion recognition.

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: An Agent-in-the-Loop framework that continuously improves LLM-based customer support systems through real-time human feedback integration, reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard offline approaches with batch annotations are slow and inefficient for improving customer support systems. There's a need for continuous improvement mechanisms that can rapidly incorporate human feedback into operational workflows.

Method: AITL framework integrates four types of real-time annotations into live customer operations: pairwise response preferences, agent adoption and rationales, knowledge relevance checks, and identification of missing knowledge. These feedback signals directly feed into model updates.

Result: Production pilot showed significant improvements: retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality (+8.4% helpfulness), and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). Retraining cycles reduced from months to weeks.

Conclusion: Embedding human feedback loops directly into operational workflows is highly effective for continuously refining LLM-based customer support systems, enabling rapid iteration and improvement.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

### [231] [Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06711)
*Batu El,Mert Yuksekgonul,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-agents for automated agent design face three key challenges: evolutionary approaches outperform context expansion for learning across iterations, designed agents lack behavioral diversity limiting complementary use, and automated design is only economically viable for a few datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine key challenges in meta-agents that automate the design of agentic systems, particularly focusing on learning across iterations, behavioral diversity, and economic viability.

Method: Investigated three challenges: 1) compared learning approaches (context expansion vs evolutionary), 2) analyzed behavioral diversity of designed agents, 3) assessed economic viability by comparing costs of automated vs human-designed agents across different datasets and scales.

Result: Evolutionary approach outperforms context expansion; designed agents have low behavioral diversity; automated design is only cost-effective for 2 datasets when deployed on over 15,000 examples, with performance gains not justifying costs for other datasets.

Conclusion: Current meta-agent approaches have significant limitations in learning efficiency, behavioral diversity, and economic viability, suggesting the need for improved methods that address these fundamental challenges.

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiCNKG is a framework that integrates cognitive neuroscience, gene ontology, and disease ontology knowledge graphs using LLMs to create a unified knowledge graph connecting genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional machine learning methods in capturing complex semantic relationships between genes, diseases, and cognitive processes by leveraging large language models for knowledge graph integration.

Method: Integrates three knowledge sources (Cognitive Neuroscience KG, Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology) using LLMs like GPT-4 for entity alignment, semantic similarity computation, and graph augmentation to create a unified knowledge graph.

Result: Created MultiCNKG with 6.9K nodes across 5 types and 11.3K edges across 7 types, achieving high performance metrics: precision (85.20%), recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), and competitive link prediction results with TransE (MR: 391, MRR: 0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395).

Conclusion: MultiCNKG provides a robust framework that advances applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis formulation in cognitive neuroscience by offering a multi-layered view from molecular to behavioral domains.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A tool for automated verification of LLM-based policies in sequential decision-making tasks using MDPs and PCTL safety requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous formal verification for LLM policies in safety-critical sequential decision-making scenarios where traditional methods may not apply.

Method: Incrementally constructs reachable MDP states guided by LLM actions, encodes states as natural language prompts, parses LLM responses into actions, and uses Storm model checker for formal verification.

Result: Open source LLMs can be verified when deterministically seeded but generally underperform deep reinforcement learning baselines in grid world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The tool enables practical formal verification of LLM policies and lays foundation for verifying increasingly capable LLMs in sequential decision-making tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

TL;DR: DLMA is a double-loop multi-agent framework that automates scientific research through evolutionary planning by professor agents and dynamic execution by student agents, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating end-to-end scientific research requires both novel high-level planning and correct execution under uncertainty, posing a fundamental bilevel challenge.

Method: DLMA uses professor agents in a leader loop for evolutionary planning through meetings, and doctoral student agents in a follower loop for dynamic plan execution with contextual adjustments.

Result: DLMA achieves state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory, significantly outperforming strong baselines in automated evaluation.

Conclusion: Both evolutionary planning and dynamic execution loops are critical - evolution drives novelty while execution ensures soundness in automated scientific research.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATF is an autoformalization approach that integrates tool feedback (syntax checking and consistency validation) to improve generation of valid formal statements, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization models struggle to consistently generate syntactically valid and semantically consistent formal statements from natural language mathematical problems.

Method: ATF incorporates Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and multi-LLMs-as-judge for consistency validation, with training phases including cold-start on synthetic data, expert iteration, and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: ATF markedly outperforms baseline formalizer models, shows excellent inference scaling properties, and the authors open-source Numina-ATF dataset with 750K synthetic formal statements.

Conclusion: The tool feedback approach effectively enhances both syntactic validity and semantic consistency in autoformalization, advancing ATP research.

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

TL;DR: TGPR combines GRPO with Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to improve iterative refinement in LLMs by actively exploring both failed and successful refinement paths, achieving significant performance gains on code generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative refinement methods for LLMs rely on predefined heuristics that struggle with the exploration-exploitation dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes, limiting their effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: TGPR combines GRPO (likely a policy optimization method) with Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to explore refinement paths more effectively, using denser training trajectories and adaptive policies that learn from both successful and failed attempts.

Result: On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, TGPR achieves up to +4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to +12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to a competitive GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: TGPR provides a principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs beyond just code debugging tasks.

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An IDE for AJAN multi-agent systems that addresses RDF/SPARQL complexity and enables LLM-assisted agent engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AJAN framework requires complex RDF/RDFS and SPARQL knowledge, which is error-prone and has a steep learning curve, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Developed an integrated development environment that simplifies agent modeling and incorporates Large Language Models to assist in agent engineering.

Result: The IDE reduces hurdles in defining agent behaviors and extends AJAN's user community by leveraging LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed IDE successfully addresses the complexity issues in AJAN agent modeling and expands accessibility through LLM integration.

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that step-level uniformity in information density (following the Uniform Information Density hypothesis) strongly correlates with reasoning quality in LLMs, with more uniform traces yielding 10-32% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the Uniform Information Density hypothesis applies to LLM reasoning traces and whether step-level information uniformity reflects reasoning quality.

Method: Proposed entropy-based stepwise information density metric with two uniformity measures (local and global), tested on six reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Correct reasoning traces avoid sharp information density spikes while incorrect ones show irregular bursts; selecting uniform traces improves accuracy by 10-32% at AIME2025.

Conclusion: UID-inspired information density measures are robust predictors of reasoning quality and effective selection criteria for building more reliable reasoning systems.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

TL;DR: TAPO is a reinforcement learning framework that combines multi-hop reasoning with adaptive tool-calling capabilities, enabling models to dynamically use tools like search APIs and Python interpreters during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle with tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge or computational tools for complex arithmetic operations, despite advances in test-time scaling approaches.

Method: Proposes Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), adapting Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) for tool invocation scenarios, with two new datasets (TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K) for training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models show state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation, with more efficient tool utilization than baselines while preventing excessive calls.

Conclusion: Combining advanced reasoning with tool usage significantly enhances model performance in knowledge-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework using multiple LLM agents with human demonstrations to capture population diversity, addressing LLM homogeneity through submodular optimization for representative agent selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are promising proxies for human behavior but produce homogeneous outputs that fail to capture human diversity. Need to represent the rich diversity of human perspectives and behaviors.

Method: Construct multiple LLM agents conditioned on human demonstrations via in-context learning. Use submodular optimization to select representative agents from the large space of possible agents.

Result: Agents effectively represent human populations compared to baselines. Behavioral analyses show agents reproduce behavior patterns and perspectives of the represented students and annotators.

Conclusion: Multi-agent framework with submodular optimization successfully captures human diversity, making LLMs better proxies for human behavior across domains.

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

*Hongbo Hu,Yisong Wang,Yi Huang,Kewen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an inductive reasoning approach for possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models, introducing two algorithms (ilpsm and ilpsmmin) to extract poss-programs from background programs and examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While possibilistic stable models semantics and properties have been well studied, the problem of inductive reasoning for poss-programs has not been investigated previously.

Method: The authors formally define induction tasks, investigate their properties, and present two algorithms (ilpsm and ilpsmmin) for computing induction solutions. They also implement ilpsmmin and conduct experiments.

Result: Experimental results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype implementation outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from stable models on randomly generated datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in inductive reasoning for possibilistic logic programs by providing formal definitions, algorithms, and empirical validation of the approach.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

*André Hottung,Federico Berto,Chuanbo Hua,Nayeli Gast Zepeda,Daniel Wetzel,Michael Römer,Haoran Ye,Davide Zago,Michael Poli,Stefano Massaroli,Jinkyoo Park,Kevin Tierney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRPAgent is a framework that uses LLM-generated components within a metaheuristic and refines them through genetic search to create high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems, outperforming handcrafted methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective heuristics for VRPs requires deep domain expertise, and current LLM-based code generation falls short of human-crafted heuristics. The goal is to leverage LLMs to automate heuristic discovery while maintaining correctness and performance.

Method: VRPAgent integrates LLM-generated problem-specific operators into a generic metaheuristic framework and refines them using a novel genetic search approach to discover effective strategies.

Result: The method discovers heuristic operators that outperform both handcrafted methods and recent learning-based approaches across multiple VRP variants (capacitated VRP, VRP with time windows, prize-collecting VRP) while using only a single CPU core.

Conclusion: VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance state-of-the-art in VRPs, demonstrating promising potential for automated heuristics discovery in complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

### [243] [The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07091)
*Baixuan Xu,Tianshi Zheng,Zhaowei Wang,Hong Ting Tsang,Weiqi Wang,Tianqing Fang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies optimal action representations for long-horizon agents in combinatorial action spaces, comparing Planning with Actions (PwA) vs Planning with Schemas (PwS), identifying an inflection point between different environment scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional action planning methods become impractical when environmental action space is combinatorially exploded in open-ended real world scenarios, necessitating scalable action representations for long-horizon autonomy.

Method: Systematic comparison of two action representations: PwA (direct action lists) and PwS (schema instantiation). Proposed cognitive bandwidth framework and conducted controlled experiments across ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions) environments.

Result: Found a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld and SciWorld scales. Model capacity affects inflection location: stronger planning shifts it rightward, better schema instantiation shifts it leftward. PwS agents showed suboptimal performance.

Conclusion: Need for scalable action representations in combinatorial action spaces. Provided actionable guidance for building more capable PwS agents to achieve better scalable autonomy.

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

### [244] [The Contingencies of Physical Embodiment Allow for Open-Endedness and Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07117)
*Leonardo Christov-Moore,Arthur Juliani,Alex Kiefer,Nicco Reggente,B. Scott Rousse,Adam Safron,Nicol'as Hinrichs,Daniel Polani,Antonio Damasio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes minimal conditions for physical embodiment inspired by existentialist philosophy to develop more robust and caring artificial agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why biological organisms adapt well to open-ended environments while artificial agents struggle, and to develop more adaptive AI systems.

Method: Defines two conditions from Heidegger's philosophy (being-in-the-world and being-towards-death), combines with Nietzsche's will-to-power concept, and formalizes within reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Proposes that from these conditions emerge homeostatic drive and intrinsic drive to maximize control over future states, enabling agents to better meet future needs.

Conclusion: Intrinsically driven embodied agents in open-ended multi-agent environments can cultivate capacities for open-endedness and care through this philosophical framework.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

*Ali Norouzifar,Humam Kourani,Marcus Dees,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interactive framework that uses Large Language Models to incorporate domain knowledge from natural language descriptions into process discovery, improving model reliability by combining event log data with expert-provided declarative rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process discovery methods rely solely on event logs, which are often incomplete or noisy, and ignore valuable domain knowledge, leading to unreliable models for downstream tasks.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract declarative rules from natural language domain expert descriptions, then applies the IMr discovery algorithm that recursively constructs process models by combining insights from both event logs and extracted rules.

Result: Developed a fully implemented tool supporting the workflow, conducted extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies, and validated through a real-life case study with domain experts.

Conclusion: The framework effectively incorporates domain knowledge into process discovery, helping avoid problematic process structures that contradict expert knowledge and improving model reliability.

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NewtonBench is a new benchmark for scientific law discovery with 324 tasks across 12 physics domains, designed to overcome the trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and memorization-resistance through metaphysical shifts and interactive model discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for scientific law discovery suffer from a methodological trilemma forcing trade-offs between scientific relevance, scalability, and memorization-resistance, and oversimplify discovery as static function fitting rather than capturing the authentic scientific process.

Method: NewtonBench uses metaphysical shifts (systematic alterations of canonical laws) to generate scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant problems. It elevates evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles.

Result: Frontier LLMs show clear but fragile discovery capability that degrades with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Tool assistance paradoxically hinders more capable models by inducing premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions.

Conclusion: Robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. NewtonBench provides a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed for measuring progress and guiding development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

### [247] [Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Lexicographic Cost Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07276)
*Pulkit Rustagi,Kyle Hollins Wray,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) for multi-objective multi-agent path finding that directly computes solutions aligned with user preferences, avoiding Pareto frontier computation and scaling to 10 objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MO-MAPF algorithms don't optimize for user-defined preferences even when available, and scale poorly with increasing objectives. Need for efficient planning that directly incorporates preference ordering.

Method: Lexicographic framework with LCBS algorithm that integrates priority-aware low-level A* search with conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction.

Result: LCBS computes optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives, with consistently higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, especially with more objectives.

Conclusion: Lexicographic approach enables efficient multi-objective multi-agent path planning that directly incorporates user preferences and scales well beyond current methods.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

TL;DR: Generative AI workflow enables NFL media researchers to query historical plays using natural language instead of traditional interfaces, achieving 95% accuracy and reducing search time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve content discovery and management for media researchers by enabling natural language queries instead of traditional filter-and-click interfaces, increasing operational efficiency.

Method: Agentic workflow that takes user queries, breaks them into elements, translates them into database query language, and uses semantic caching to improve accuracy and latency.

Result: Achieved over 95% accuracy and reduced average search time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The generative AI solution successfully enables faster, more accurate content discovery, allowing users to focus on creative content production rather than time-consuming searches.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.
