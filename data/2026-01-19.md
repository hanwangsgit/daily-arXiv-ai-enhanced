TL;DR: FOFPred is a language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model that combines Vision-Language Model and Diffusion architecture for predicting future motion from noisy web-scale human activity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations (like optical flow) is valuable for control and generative tasks, but remains challenging and underexplored with noisy real-world data.

Method: Unified VLM-Diffusion architecture combining multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity, trained on web-scale human activity data with crucial preprocessing techniques and strong image pretraining.

Result: The model successfully tackles robotic manipulation and video generation tasks under language-driven settings, demonstrating cross-domain versatility.

Conclusion: FOFPred confirms the value of unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapted Sparse4D framework for large-scale infrastructure MTMC tracking using world-coordinate priors, occlusion-aware ReID, and generative data augmentation, achieving SOTA HOTA 45.22 on AI City 2025 with 2.15× speedup via TensorRT optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitioning autonomous driving models to static camera networks faces challenges from heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion in industrial infrastructure environments.

Method: Adapted Sparse4D framework with absolute world-coordinate geometric priors, occlusion-aware ReID embedding module, generative data augmentation using NVIDIA COSMOS for Sim2Real gap, and optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art HOTA of 45.22 on AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, with 2.15× speedup on modern GPUs enabling single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

Conclusion: The camera-only framework successfully addresses infrastructure MTMC tracking challenges through geometric priors, occlusion-aware identity management, and hardware acceleration for real-time deployment at scale.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA). Our hardware-accelerated implementation achieves a $2.15\times$ speedup on modern GPU architectures, enabling a single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

### [4] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of three VLMs (GPT-4o, Florence 2, LLaVa-1.5) for construction worker action and emotion recognition from static images, with GPT-4o performing best but all struggling with semantically similar categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robotics integrate into construction, understanding human behavior is crucial for safe collaboration. VLMs offer potential for behavior recognition without extensive domain-specific training, which is valuable in construction where labeled data is scarce but monitoring worker actions and emotions is critical for safety and productivity.

Method: Evaluated three leading VLMs (GPT-4o, Florence 2, LLaVa-1.5) on a curated dataset of 1,000 construction site images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories. Used standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics including F1-scores and accuracy, with confusion matrix analysis to identify error patterns.

Result: GPT-4o achieved highest performance: F1-score 0.756 and accuracy 0.799 for action recognition; F1-score 0.712 and accuracy 0.773 for emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately (F1: 0.497 action, 0.414 emotion). LLaVa-1.5 showed lowest performance (F1: 0.466 action, 0.461 emotion). All models struggled with semantically close categories like collaborating vs communicating.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs provide baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction, but further improvements (domain adaptation, temporal modeling, multimodal sensing) are needed for real-world reliability, especially for distinguishing semantically similar categories.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [5] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OOD detection performance doesn't always improve with higher ID accuracy - it initially improves but declines when advanced training pushes accuracy too high, and no single OOD detection method works best across all training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between modern training pipelines (that maximize ID accuracy) and OOD detection performance, which remains under-explored despite advances in OOD detectors.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study using ResNet-50 architecture, benchmarking 21 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models from diverse training strategies, evaluated on 8 OOD test sets.

Result: Found non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with ID accuracy but declines when advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond baseline. Strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and OOD performance - no single method is universally optimal.

Conclusion: The common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection is incorrect; OOD detection performance has a complex relationship with training strategies, and detector selection should consider the specific training approach used.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [6] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reducing temporal information while increasing frame resolution affects 3D CNN action recognition performance, testing attention-enhanced variants of MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D models on UCF101.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between temporal information and spatial resolution in action recognition, and to explore how different attention mechanisms can compensate for reduced temporal features in high-resolution models.

Method: Created modified versions of MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D with reduced temporal knowledge but increased frame resolution, added dropout before final classifier, then developed 10 attention-enhanced variants per model (CBAM, TCN, multi-headed attention, channel attention). Tested on UCF101 dataset.

Result: Best performance achieved 88.98% accuracy on UCF101 using multi-headed attention with modified R(2+1)D. Variants showed different class-level accuracy behaviors despite similar overall performance improvements.

Conclusion: Missing temporal features significantly impact performance in high-resolution models, but attention mechanisms can partially compensate. Different attention blocks affect class-level accuracy differently, suggesting task-specific attention selection may be beneficial.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

### [7] [Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880)
*Chongcong Jiang,Tianxingjian Ding,Chuhan Song,Jiachen Tu,Ziyang Yan,Yihua Shao,Zhenyi Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Tianyu Han,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3 is a fine-tuned version of SAM3 specifically adapted for medical image segmentation, addressing domain shift issues and achieving robust performance across diverse medical imaging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Promptable segmentation models like SAM3 have strong generalization but perform poorly on medical images due to domain shifts, lack of spatial prompts, and complex anatomical structures. Vanilla SAM3's apparent competitiveness relies on strong geometric priors that aren't available in real medical applications.

Method: Full fine-tuning of SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Training spans 33 datasets across 10 medical imaging modalities to acquire domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility.

Result: Medical SAM3 achieves consistent and significant performance gains over vanilla SAM3, particularly in challenging scenarios with semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. It establishes robust domain-specific representations while maintaining prompt-driven flexibility.

Conclusion: Medical SAM3 serves as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging, demonstrating that holistic model adaptation (beyond just prompt engineering) is essential for robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [8] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrankenMotion: A diffusion-based framework for fine-grained human motion generation with atomic, temporally-aware part-level control using LLM-annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion methods lack fine-grained controllability over individual body parts due to absence of part-level motion annotations, limiting their spatial and temporal control capabilities.

Method: 1) Construct high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level annotations using LLMs; 2) Develop diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt.

Result: FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted for this setting and can compose motions unseen during training, demonstrating superior spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control.

Conclusion: First work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and enable motion generation with both spatial and temporal control, advancing fine-grained controllable motion synthesis.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL-guided Latent Diffusion Model generates synthetic DUV-FSM patches to overcome data scarcity, improving breast cancer margin assessment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast-Conserving Surgery requires precise margin assessment, but deep learning models for DUV-FSM imaging are limited by scarce annotated data.

Method: Propose SSL-guided Latent Diffusion Model using DINO teacher embeddings to generate synthetic training patches, then fine-tune Vision Transformer with real+synthetic data for WSI classification.

Result: Achieves 96.47% accuracy and reduces FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines in 5-fold cross-validation.

Conclusion: The SSL-guided LDM effectively addresses DUV data scarcity, enabling robust deep learning models for improved breast cancer surgical margin assessment.

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

TL;DR: RobuMTL is a robust multi-task learning architecture that uses adaptive LoRA modules and expert squads to handle visual degradation from adverse weather conditions, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world autonomous systems face performance degradation from adverse weather conditions, requiring robust multi-task learning approaches that can adapt to visual perturbations.

Method: RobuMTL dynamically selects task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion, enabling adaptive specialization for different weather conditions.

Result: On PASCAL: +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations, up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions vs MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2: +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks.

Conclusion: RobuMTL effectively addresses visual degradation in adverse weather through adaptive LoRA module selection, demonstrating superior robustness over existing methods for multi-task learning in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

### [12] [Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931)
*David Szczecina,Hudson Sun,Anthony Bertnyk,Niloofar Azad,Kyle Gao,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Five deep learning architectures (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNET, DINOv2) evaluated for tree canopy segmentation with only 150 annotated images. CNN-based models (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN) outperform transformer-based models in low-data regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree canopy detection is important for environmental monitoring, but real-world scenarios often have limited annotated data. The Solafune competition provides only 150 imbalanced images, creating challenges for training deep models without overfitting.

Method: Evaluated five representative architectures on the small dataset: YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNET, and DINOv2. Analyzed training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under data scarcity constraints.

Result: Pretrained CNN-based models (YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN) generalized significantly better than transformer-based models. DeepLabV3, Swin-UNET and DINOv2 underperformed due to task differences (semantic vs instance segmentation), high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and lack of strong inductive biases.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation. Lightweight CNN-based methods remain most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery, confirming the importance of inductive biases and task alignment in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

### [13] [PatientVLM Meets DocVLM: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Between Vision-Language Models for Efficient Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10945)
*K Lokesh,Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri,Uday Agarwal,Apoorva Challa,Shreya K Gowda,Somesh Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) uses two VLMs to simulate doctor-patient diagnostic dialogues, improving medical AI beyond image-only approaches through realistic symptom elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI medical diagnosis focuses on image analysis but lacks patient-reported symptoms, which limits diagnostic accuracy. Real-world diagnosis involves iterative questioning of patients, which current AI systems don't simulate.

Method: Proposed PCDF simulates diagnostic dialogues using two VLMs: DocVLM generates follow-up questions based on images and dialogue history, while PatientVLM responds using symptom profiles from ground-truth diagnoses. The synthetic dialogues are clinically validated and used to fine-tune DocVLM.

Result: Clinical validation confirmed synthetic symptoms are clinically relevant, cover symptoms adequately, and appear realistic. Fine-tuning DocVLM with dialogue-based supervision yields substantial improvements over image-only training.

Conclusion: Realistic symptom elicitation through simulated doctor-patient dialogues significantly enhances diagnostic AI performance, demonstrating the value of incorporating patient-reported symptoms beyond image analysis alone.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

TL;DR: MMedExpert-R1 is a novel medical vision-language model that addresses clinical reasoning limitations through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MedVLMs excel at perception but struggle with complex clinical reasoning needed in real-world scenarios. Existing RL approaches face three critical mismatches: scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

*Xianliang Huang,Jiajie Gou,Shuhang Chen,Zhizhou Zhong,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDDR-NGP is the first unified distractor removal method for Instant-NGP that can remove various 3D scene distractors (snow, confetti, leaves, petals) using implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, trained end-to-end with LPIPS and multi-view compensation losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on specific distractor types, lacking a unified approach. There's need for a general method to remove various 3D scene distractors and a benchmark dataset for this research area.

Method: IDDR-NGP combines implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, using LPIPS loss and multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to optimize rendering from corrupted multi-view images. End-to-end training enables high-quality 3D scene synthesis.

Result: Method effectively removes multiple distractor types (snowflakes, confetti, defoliation, petals) from both synthetic and real scenes. Achieves comparable results to SOTA desnow methods and handles realistic/synthetic distractors accurately.

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP provides the first unified solution for distractor removal in implicit 3D representations, with strong performance across various distractor types, supported by a new benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Conclusion: AIGVDBench addresses current limitations in AI-generated video detection by providing a comprehensive, representative benchmark that offers solid foundation for advancing the field, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DDM+ improves video outpainting quality by fixing training-inference mismatch in mask strategy, enhancing visual fidelity and temporal coherence in challenging scenarios while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M3DDM suffers from quality degradation (spatial blur and temporal inconsistency) in challenging scenarios with limited camera motion or large outpainting regions where inter-frame information is limited.

Method: Proposes M3DDM+ which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model to address the training-inference mismatch.

Result: M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed training strategy effectively addresses the quality degradation issues in M3DDM, making it more robust for challenging video outpainting scenarios.

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, addressing the gap in physical realism in transformer-based video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based video generation models lack physical realism, particularly in rendering rigid body motion. While computer graphics/physics simulators can model collisions using Newtonian formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising, treating even correct mathematical constraints as suboptimal conditions during optimization.

Method: Introduces a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Extends this to a unified framework called Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle) that allows substantial fine-tuning while preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback.

Result: Constructs a new benchmark PhysRVGBench and performs extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm and MDcycle framework address the critical limitation of physical realism in video generation by directly enforcing physical collision rules in high-dimensional spaces, moving beyond treating physics as mere conditions during optimization.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDance is a novel Unbind-Rebind framework for multi-subject character animation that handles arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial misalignment between reference images and driving poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character animation methods struggle with arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between reference images and driving poses due to rigid spatial binding and inconsistent motion rebinding.

Method: Proposes CoDance with two modules: 1) Unbind module uses pose shift encoder with stochastic perturbations to break rigid spatial binding and learn location-agnostic motion; 2) Rebind module uses semantic text prompts and spatial subject masks to direct motion to intended characters.

Result: CoDance achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new CoDanceBench and existing datasets, showing remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts.

Conclusion: CoDance's Unbind-Rebind framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling flexible multi-subject animation with arbitrary counts, types, and spatial configurations, with code and weights to be open-sourced.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

Motivation: Graph-based methods for 3D point cloud analysis often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas, which limit their effectiveness.

Method: Integrates a graph smoothing module to optimize graph structure by minimizing unreliable sparse/noisy connections, plus an enhanced local geometry learning module with shape features from adaptive geometric descriptors (eigenvectors) and distribution features from cylindrical coordinate transformation.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets validate effectiveness in various point cloud learning tasks including classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of conventional graph structures in 3D point cloud analysis through graph smoothing and enhanced local geometry learning, demonstrating improved performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: VIGA is a vision-as-inverse-graphics agent that reconstructs scenes through iterative execution and verification, improving one-shot baselines by 35-124% across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding needed for one-shot vision-as-inverse-graphics, which requires reconstructing images as editable graphics programs.

Method: VIGA uses a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure with a skill library (alternating generator/verifier roles) and evolving context memory containing plans, code diffs, and render history.

Result: VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines: 35.32% on BlenderGym, 117.17% on SlideBench, and 124.70% on the new BlenderBench benchmark for interleaved multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: VIGA demonstrates that iterative execution and verification enables vision-as-inverse-graphics, providing a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary modules.

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

TL;DR: SoLA-Vision proposes a layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that strategically combines linear and softmax attention layers to achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than purely linear or rigid hybrid designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention has quadratic complexity O(N²) limiting high-resolution vision tasks, while linear attention reduces to O(N) but suffers from compressed state representations that impair modeling capacity and accuracy. There's a need for better attention mechanisms that balance computational efficiency with representation quality.

Method: Conducted analytical study comparing linear and softmax attention from layer-stacking perspective, then systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns. Proposed SoLA-Vision - a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over integration of linear and softmax attention through strategic insertion of global softmax layers.

Result: SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models on ImageNet-1K. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by considerable margins. Fine-grained layer-wise hybridization matches or surpasses performance while requiring fewer softmax layers compared to rigid intra-block hybrid designs.

Conclusion: Strategic layer-wise hybridization of linear and softmax attention enables strong accuracy-computation trade-offs. SoLA-Vision demonstrates that carefully inserting a small number of global softmax layers into a linear attention backbone can achieve superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin.

TL;DR: ESD is an ultra-lightweight 30-m global Earth embedding database (2000-2024) that compresses multi-sensor satellite data by ~340x using latent vectors, enabling planetary-scale analysis on standard workstations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite EO systems generate massive archives that are computationally prohibitive for global-scale analysis, hindering planetary-scale studies and widespread use of Earth observation data.

Method: Transform Landsat (5,7,8,9) and MODIS Terra observations into information-dense quantized latent vectors using ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), condensing annual phenological cycles into 12 temporal steps.

Result: Achieves ~340-fold data volume reduction (2.4 TB/year for global land surface), high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543), and 79.74% land-cover classification accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion).

Conclusion: ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research with robust few-shot learning capabilities, longitudinal consistency, and inherent denoising, advancing next-generation geospatial AI.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: A multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples using Rectified Flow models, offering faster computation and better alignment than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint generation of aligned samples either don't address structural alignment properly or use inefficient approaches like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) which is time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and produces cartoonish results.

Method: Proposes a joint transport approach based on Rectified Flow models operating on structured latent space. The method performs joint inference of paired samples through structural alignment in the sample space, building on top of existing Rectified Flow models.

Result: Achieves high structural alignment and visual quality for paired samples. Improves state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, shows comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Rectified Flow-based approach provides an efficient and effective solution for joint inference of structurally aligned samples across multiple domains (image, video, 3D), addressing limitations of previous methods while maintaining high quality.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

TL;DR: UMS-ReID expands person re-identification across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change) using a vision-language framework with scenario embedding and text representation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current person re-identification methods are typically designed for specific scenarios, lacking a unified framework that can handle multiple diverse scenarios like cross-resolution matching and clothing changes simultaneously.

Method: Three-stage ITKM framework: 1) Fine-tune CLIP with scenario embedding in image encoder, 2) Optimize text embeddings with multi-scenario separation loss, 3) Use heterogeneous matching modules and dynamic text update for cross-scenario consistency.

Result: ITKM outperforms existing scenario-specific methods and shows superior generalizability across multiple scenarios by effectively integrating knowledge from diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed UMS-ReID framework with ITKM successfully addresses multi-scenario person re-identification, demonstrating that vision-language models can be effectively adapted for complex cross-scenario matching tasks.

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval, making it practical for edge deployment while handling handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps effectively.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

*Cheng-Zhuang Liu,Si-Bao Chen,Qing-Ling Shu,Chris Ding,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTDMamba is a novel network for UAV video anomaly detection that handles dynamic backgrounds by disentangling coupled motion patterns using frequency analysis and modeling multi-scale temporal dynamics with Mamba architecture, achieving SOTA performance on both static and new dynamic UAV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video anomaly detection methods focus on static backgrounds, but UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds present unique challenges: multi-source motion coupling (object motion + UAV motion) causes false positives, and existing methods fail to model inter-frame continuity and spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales effectively.

Method: Proposes FTDMamba network with two core components: 1) Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module that disentangles coupled motion patterns through frequency analysis to model global spatiotemporal dependencies, and 2) Temporal Dilation Mamba Module that leverages Mamba's sequence modeling to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public static benchmarks and the newly constructed MUVAD dataset (222,736 frames, 240 anomaly events across 12 types). Also introduces the first large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset addressing dynamic background scenarios.

Conclusion: FTDMamba effectively addresses the limitations of existing VAD methods for UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds by disentangling motion coupling and modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies, establishing new benchmarks for dynamic UAV anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Distill uses cross-architecture knowledge distillation from large ViTs to compact CNNs for data-efficient robotic manipulation, achieving SOTA performance by combining ViT generalization with CNN optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer strong generalization but require extensive data, while compact CNNs are easier to optimize in data-scarce robotic learning settings. There's a need to combine ViT's representation power with CNN's data efficiency.

Method: Offline cross-architecture knowledge distillation transfers visual representations from frozen DINOv2 teacher to ResNet-18 student on ImageNet, then fine-tunes distilled encoder with diffusion policy head on target manipulation tasks.

Result: Outperforms policies with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders across 34 simulated benchmarks and 5 real-world tasks, also surpassing 3D encoders using point clouds and larger Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: Simple cross-architecture distillation strategy effectively combines ViT generalization with CNN optimization efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

*Vishisht Sharma,Sam Leroux,Lisa Landuyt,Nick Witvrouwen,Pieter Simoens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) accelerates video segmentation on UAVs by reusing tokens from static regions, reducing latency 30% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oblique aerial video is crucial for rapid disaster response but processing high-resolution streams on UAVs is bottlenecked by strict SWaP constraints, preventing low-latency inference on edge hardware.

Method: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) formulates image patches as tokens, uses lightweight similarity metrics to identify static regions, and propagates precomputed deep features to bypass redundant backbone computations.

Result: On edge-grade hardware, TTR achieves 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible segmentation accuracy degradation (< 0.5% mIoU), validated on standard benchmarks and a new Oblique Floodwater Dataset.

Conclusion: TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions on resource-constrained UAVs.

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

Motivation: Current video segmentation workflows face trade-offs between manual curation (labor-intensive), commercial platforms (costly), and cloud services (privacy-compromising). High-fidelity video instance segmentation is hindered by manual annotation bottlenecks and privacy concerns.

Method: Integrates Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into human-in-the-loop workflow with modified dependencies to reduce resource requirements.

Conclusion: SAMannot offers a practical solution for complex video annotation tasks by combining foundation model capabilities with human oversight in a local, privacy-preserving framework that addresses current workflow limitations.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASWiT is a dual-branch Swin Transformer architecture for semantic ultra-high resolution image segmentation that addresses memory constraints by injecting global context into fine-grained features through cross-scale fusion and SimMIM-style pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with UHR image segmentation due to quadratic memory growth with token count, which constrains either contextual scope or spatial resolution. There's a need for efficient architectures that can handle both fine-grained details and long-range dependencies in remote sensing applications.

Method: Dual-branch Swin-based architecture with: 1) Context encoder for downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, 2) High-resolution encoder for detailed UHR patch features, 3) Cross-scale fusion module using cross-attention and gated feature injection to enrich high-resolution tokens with context. Plus SimMIM-style pretraining that masks 75% of high-resolution tokens and corresponding low-resolution center region.

Result: Achieves 65.83% mIoU on IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR dataset, achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing current state-of-the-art by +0.9% under official evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: CASWiT effectively addresses memory constraints in UHR segmentation by combining global context with fine-grained features through dual-branch architecture and cross-scale fusion, demonstrating superior performance on large-scale aerial datasets with publicly available code.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs can generate interpretable descriptions for situational awareness, but need improvements for identifying infrequent significant events with high reliability, extracting fine-grained details, and assessing recognition quality.

Method: Integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning, with intelligent fine-tuning strategy and justification generation for VLM outputs during inference.

Result: Intelligent fine-tuning achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and provides means to confirm validity of VLM outputs or indicate why they may be questionable.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances situational awareness capabilities by combining VLMs with traditional CV and logic reasoning, improving accuracy and providing interpretable justifications for model outputs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

TL;DR: A deep learning approach for separating multiple chromogenic stains in multiplex immunohistochemistry RGB whole slide images, overcoming limitations of classical Beer-Lambert deconvolution for K>3 stains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Beer-Lambert color deconvolution becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC with more than 3 chromogens, creating a need for better stain separation methods for stain normalization, quantitative assessment, and cell-level analysis.

Method: A data-driven encoder-decoder architecture with a compact U-Net encoder predicting K nonnegative concentration channels, and a differentiable Beer-Lambert forward model decoder with learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms discouraging unnecessary stain mixing.

Result: Excellent RGB reconstruction and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution on a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8).

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach effectively separates multiple stains in mIHC RGB WSIs, providing crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps that outperform classical methods for K>3 stain settings.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework combining UAV and street-view imagery via CGCViT to assess heat-relevant building attributes and health risks in urban areas, with application in Dar es Salaam showing building material inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies heat exposure in Global South cities, but scalable methods for assessing heat-relevant building attributes are lacking. There's a need to identify household-level heat exposure inequalities linked to socio-economic disadvantage.

Method: Proposes a dual-modality cross-view learning framework that fuses UAV and street-view imagery using a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT). Uses HotSat-1 thermal infrared measurements to quantify relationships between building attributes and heat-associated health risks.

Result: The dual-modality approach outperforms single-modality models by up to 9.3%. Found significant associations: vegetation around buildings, brighter roofing, and concrete/clay/wood roofing (vs. metal/tarpaulin) correlate with lower thermal infrared values. Successfully deployed in Dar es Salaam to identify heat exposure inequalities.

Conclusion: UAV and street-view imagery provide complementary perspectives for urban heat assessment. The framework enables identification of building material inequalities linked to socio-economic disadvantage, highlighting the need for localized, data-driven risk assessment for equitable climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUG introduces a heterogeneous uncertainty-guided paradigm for composed image retrieval that uses fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings and customized uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries vs uni-modal targets, improving robustness against noisy triplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Composed Image Retrieval suffers from intrinsic noise in triplets that creates uncertainty and threatens model robustness. Existing probabilistic approaches fail for CIR because they use instance-level holistic modeling and treat queries and targets homogeneously.

Method: HUG uses fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings for queries and targets. It customizes heterogeneous uncertainty estimations: for queries (multi-modal), it captures both content quality and multi-modal coordination uncertainties; for targets (uni-modal), it uses different uncertainty modeling. Includes dynamic weighting mechanism and uncertainty-guided objectives with holistic and fine-grained contrasts plus comprehensive negative sampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show HUG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with analysis justifying the technical contributions.

Conclusion: HUG successfully addresses CIR's noise and uncertainty challenges through heterogeneous uncertainty modeling and fine-grained probabilistic learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

TL;DR: SUG-Occ is a sparse learning framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that uses semantics and uncertainty guidance to reduce computation while maintaining accuracy, achieving significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic occupancy prediction provides detailed scene understanding but suffers from prohibitive computation and memory overhead, making real-time deployment challenging. The authors aim to address this efficiency bottleneck while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness.

Method: The framework has three main components: 1) Semantic and uncertainty guided sparse view transformation using unsigned distance encoding for geometric consistency, 2) Cascade sparse completion module with hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling for coarse-to-fine reasoning, and 3) Object contextual representation based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context via lightweight query-context interactions instead of expensive attention operations.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark show the approach outperforms baselines with 7.34% improvement in accuracy and 57.8% gain in efficiency.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ successfully addresses the efficiency challenges of 3D semantic occupancy prediction by exploiting scene sparsity through semantics and uncertainty guidance, achieving both improved accuracy and significant computational efficiency for practical real-time deployment.

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

TL;DR: WetSAM: A SAM-based framework for wetland mapping using satellite image time series with sparse point supervision, achieving 85.58% average F1-score across eight global regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wetland mapping faces challenges: dense pixel-level annotation is expensive, sparse point labels lead to poor deep learning performance, seasonal/inter-annual dynamics make single-date imagery inadequate, and foundation models like SAM fail to model temporal information for heterogeneous wetlands.

Method: Dual-branch design: 1) Temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to separate wetland characteristics from phenological variability; 2) Spatial branch uses temporally constrained region-growing to generate dense pseudo-labels; 3) Bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight global regions (~5,000 km² each) show WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods with average F1-score of 85.58%, delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort.

Conclusion: WetSAM demonstrates strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping by effectively integrating temporal information with sparse point supervision.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

Conclusion: SME-YOLO effectively addresses PCB defect detection challenges through specialized loss function, improved upsampling, and adaptive attention mechanisms, validating the proposed method's effectiveness.

Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Wenxiao Li,Xue-Cheng Tai,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrating width information into topological structures for image segmentation, combining persistent homology with PDE smoothing to preserve both topological invariants (connectivity, genus) and dimensional width properties (thickness, length).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topological definitions lack width information (thickness, length), limiting practical segmentation methods. Existing approaches like persistent homology cannot fully address real-world segmentation needs that require preserving both topological structures and dimensional width properties.

Method: Proposes a mathematical framework integrating width information into topological characterization. Uses persistent homology combined with PDE smoothing concepts to modify local extrema of upper-level sets, enabling topological structures to capture width properties. Incorporates this into variational segmentation models and designs neural networks with proper loss functions to enforce topological and width constraints.

Result: The approach successfully preserves topological invariants (connectivity, genus counts) while ensuring segmented structures retain critical width attributes (line thickness, length). Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness in maintaining topological fidelity while embedding width characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes limitations of traditional topological methods by explicitly integrating width information, enabling more practical and accurate image segmentation that preserves both structural topology and dimensional properties essential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

Conclusion: Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding through explicit geometric reasoning with interpretable inference traces, demonstrating strong performance with reduced supervision.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset.

Motivation: Large-scale livestock operations pose health and environmental risks and are vulnerable to threats like diseases and extreme weather. As these operations grow, accurate and scalable mapping becomes crucial for monitoring and management.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) Detect candidate infrastructure (barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) using domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector with SAM2 masks and component-specific filtering; (2) Extract structured descriptors (counts, areas, orientations, spatial relations) and fuse with deep visual features using lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier; (3) Output CAFO type predictions with mask-level attributions linking decisions to visible infrastructure.

Conclusion: The infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline provides accurate and scalable CAFO mapping with interpretable predictions, addressing critical needs for monitoring large-scale livestock operations.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference due to rapidly growing KV cache, while adapting existing VLMs to more efficient MLA architectures without expensive pretraining remains unexplored.

Method: Two core techniques: (1) modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that selectively masks nonessential dimensions for both traditional and multimodal settings, and (2) modality-decoupled low-rank approximation that independently compresses visual and textual KV spaces. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with focus on minimizing output activation error rather than parameter distance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Conclusion: MHA2MLA-VLM provides a parameter-efficient, multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA architecture, effectively addressing KV cache bottlenecks while maintaining performance with minimal adaptation cost.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

TL;DR: GeRo is a plug-and-play framework for Vision-Language-Action models that enables joint planning and language-grounded future traffic scene generation through autoregressive rollouts, improving autonomous driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models for autonomous driving mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. There's a need for more comprehensive generative capabilities that can perform language-grounded reasoning about future traffic scenes.

Method: 1) Train VLA model to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens with supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks. 2) Perform language-conditioned autoregressive generation: given multi-view images, scenario description, and ego-action questions, generate future latent tokens and textual responses for long-horizon rollouts. 3) Use rollout-consistency loss to stabilize predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment.

Result: On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score by +15.7 and success rate by +26.2. It achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance with strong zero-shot robustness by integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts.

Conclusion: GeRo demonstrates the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, enabling temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

TL;DR: ReScene4D enables consistent 4D instance segmentation in indoor scenes with sparse temporal observations, improving both temporal tracking and standard 3D segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments change over time with objects moving, appearing, or disappearing. Existing methods struggle with temporally sparse 3D scans: 3DSIS methods lack temporal reasoning and require discrete matching, while 4D LiDAR approaches rely on high-frequency measurements uncommon in indoor scene evolution.

Method: ReScene4D adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, using shared context to enable consistent instance tracking while improving 3DSIS quality.

Result: ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark. The paper introduces t-mAP metric that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the challenge of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation, enabling consistent instance tracking across intermittent scans while improving segmentation quality.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D shape generation methods require clean, unoccluded inputs, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios with casually captured data containing occlusions, clutter, and poor segmentation.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf tools (visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection, vision-language models) to extract sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and captions. Trains a rectified flow transformer conditioned on these modalities with compositional augmentations, curriculum training, and strategies to handle background clutter.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 2.7x improvement in Chamfer distance compared to state-of-the-art on a new benchmark of 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes.

Conclusion: ShapeR enables robust 3D shape generation from casually captured data, bridging the gap between controlled lab settings and real-world applications through multi-modal conditioning and specialized training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models struggle to unify visual understanding and generation because these tasks have conflicting goals - semantic abstraction vs pixel-level reconstruction. Existing parameter-shared autoregressive architectures often compromise performance in one or both tasks.

Method: UniX decouples understanding and generation into separate branches: an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. It introduces cross-modal self-attention to dynamically guide generation with understanding features, combined with data cleaning and multi-stage training.

Result: On two benchmarks, UniX achieves 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. It matches performance of task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniX establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation by effectively separating and coordinating the two tasks, leveraging diffusion models' strengths while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

TL;DR: The paper studies entropy bounds for hard random geometric graphs (RGGs) on unit cube and torus domains, deriving upper bounds and some exact asymptotic characterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random geometric graphs are important models for spatial networks, but their entropy properties are not well understood. Understanding the entropy helps characterize the information content and structural complexity of these networks.

Method: Analyze hard RGGs where nodes are random points in spatial domains (unit cube and torus) and edges connect points within distance r. Derive mathematical bounds on graph entropy H(G_m) using probabilistic and combinatorial methods.

Result: Proved: H(G_m) ∼ dm log₂m for 0 < r ≤ 1/4 on torus 𝕋^d; H(G_m) ∼ m log m for all 0<r<1 on 1D unit interval. Derived upper bounds for all cases. Conjectured that entropy asymptotically matches upper bound leading terms for remaining cases.

Conclusion: The entropy of RGGs grows with dimension and number of nodes, with exact asymptotics established for some parameter ranges. Results provide fundamental understanding of information content in spatial network models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the entropy of a hard random geometric graph (RGG), a commonly used model for spatial networks, where the connectivity is governed by the distances between the nodes. Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \sim dm \log_2m$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$ in the case of $\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $Ω((d-1)m \log_2m)$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cryptographic system that continues the tradition of seals (trust, secrecy, integrity) in the modern era with quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and sophisticated AI, requiring resistance against both classical and quantum attacks.

Method: Uses functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology to construct an asymmetric public-key algorithm operating over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold. Cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with groupoid structure from binary operations on tangent spaces. Encryption/decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks with enforced serial architecture to limit quantum parallelism, using secret geometric/analytic data including random base points, selected sections of tangent fiber bundle, and operator determinants/Zeta function regularization.

Result: The algorithm's correctness and invertibility are proven analytically. Adversarial attempts to recover plaintext without private key lead to exponential growth of search space even under quantum speedups. The approach differs from existing quantum-safe cryptography by using continuous geometric structures, non-linear operator compositions, and enforced blockwise serialization.

Conclusion: Z-Sigil provides a novel quantum-resistant cryptographic approach grounded in advanced mathematics, offering resistance against both classical and quantum attacks through geometric structures and serialized processing that limits quantum parallelism advantages.

Abstract: In antiquity, the seal embodied trust, secrecy, and integrity in safeguarding the exchange of letters and messages. The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions.

Result: Provided closed-form expressions for practical channels demonstrating tractability of bounds; simulations showed the proposed algorithm effectively improves inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics without requiring end-to-end retraining.

Conclusion: The channel-aware training approach successfully addresses the channel noise mismatch problem in edge inference, providing theoretical guarantees and practical improvements for wireless neural network deployment.

Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.

### [54] [Fundamental Limits of Quantum Semantic Communication via Sheaf Cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10958)
*Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Quantum semantic communication framework using sheaf cohomology to characterize fundamental semantic ambiguity limits and show quantum advantages over classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When agents use heterogeneous sensing/AI systems, perfect bit transmission doesn't guarantee mutual understanding. Current deep learning methods lack information-theoretic foundations for semantic alignment under heterogeneity. Semantic ambiguity shares mathematical structure with quantum contextuality (both have cohomological obstructions), motivating quantum formulation.

Method: Propose information-theoretic framework using sheaf cohomology. Model multi-agent semantic networks as quantum sheaves (agents' meaning spaces as Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels). Use first sheaf cohomology group to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity.

Result: Minimum communication rate for semantic alignment scales with log of cohomological space dimension (semantic analog of Shannon limits). For entanglement-assisted channels, capacity exceeds classical bounds - each shared ebit reduces required classical communication by 1 bit. Quantum contextuality reduces cohomological obstructions. Duality established between quantum discord and integrated semantic information.

Conclusion: Framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems, showing quantum advantages in overcoming fundamental semantic alignment limitations.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.

### [55] [Asymmetric Encoding-Decoding Schemes for Lossless Data Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10991)
*Hirosuke Yamamoto,Ken-ichi Iwata*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: AEDS is a new lossless compression scheme that generalizes tANS, allowing backward encoding while maintaining forward decoding, with broader code classes and better compression than Huffman codes under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more flexible and efficient lossless compression scheme that generalizes tANS, allowing for broader code classes and potentially better compression performance than existing methods like Huffman coding.

Method: Proposes Asymmetric Encoding-Decoding Scheme (AEDS) where data is encoded in backward order but decoded in forward order (like tANS). The scheme generalizes tANS with broader code classes, analyzes performance for i.i.d. sources, and derives theoretical bounds on average code length.

Result: AEDS with 2 states can outperform Huffman codes when a child of the root in Huffman tree has probability >0.61803 (5 states: >0.56984). Derived upper bounds on average code length that apply to both AEDS and tANS, showing convergence to source entropy at O(1/N) rate as states increase.

Conclusion: AEDS provides a flexible generalization of tANS with broader code classes and can achieve better compression than Huffman coding under certain probability conditions, with theoretical guarantees on convergence to optimal entropy coding performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\bm{s}=s_1s_2\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \cdots, 2,1$, while $\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.

*Lei Li,Yanqing Xu,Ye Xue,Feng Yin,Chao Shen,Rui Zhang,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: PEM is a localized framework that jointly embeds channel statistics and traffic patterns for 5G/6G networks, enabling low-overhead environment-aware optimization using standard measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G/6G networks need to make decisions in dynamic environments under strict constraints, requiring prior knowledge of spatial-temporal channel variations and traffic demands. Existing approaches lack joint channel-traffic representation or are impractical for large-scale deployment.

Method: Proposes Perception Embedding Map (PEM) - a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns using standard-compliant measurements (measurement reports, scheduling/QoS logs).

Result: PEM enables joint channel-traffic knowledge representation that supports environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: PEM distinctively emphasizes joint channel-traffic embedding essential for network optimization and practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy with favorable fidelity-cost balance for 5G/6G deployments.

Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.

### [57] [Sensing Mutual Information for Communication Signal with Deterministic Pilots and Random Data Payloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11149)
*Lei Xie,Hengtao He,Jun Tong,Fan Liu,Shenghui Song*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes sensing mutual information and precoding design for ISAC systems using hybrid communication signals with both pilots and data payloads, addressing a gap in existing literature that focuses only on purely random or deterministic waveforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISAC literature overlooks the hybrid structure of real-world communication signals that combine deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. This gap needs to be addressed to properly quantify sensing capabilities in operational communication standards.

Method: The authors use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form expression for sensing mutual information that accounts for the statistical properties of hybrid signals. They then formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with power and communication rate constraints, solved using an alternating direction method of multipliers framework.

Result: Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical SMI expression and demonstrate that the proposed precoding design outperforms conventional benchmarks in ISAC systems.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between theoretical ISAC analysis and practical communication standards by developing a framework that properly handles hybrid pilot-data signals, providing both theoretical insights and practical precoding solutions for real-world ISAC systems.

Abstract: The recent emergence of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework has sparked significant interest in quantifying the sensing capabilities inherent in communication signals. However, existing literature has mainly focused on scenarios involving either purely random or purely deterministic waveforms. This overlooks a critical reality: operational communication standards invariably utilize a hybrid structure comprising both deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the sensing mutual information (SMI) and precoding design specifically for ISAC systems employing communication signals with both pilots and data payloads. First, by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we derive a tractable closed-form expression for the SMI that accurately accounts for the statistical properties of the hybrid signal. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with constraints on the transmit power and communication rate, which is solved via an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed precoding design over conventional benchmarks.

*Noor Ul Ain,Lorenzo Miretti,Renato L. G. Cavalcante,Sławomir Stańczak*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how imperfect line-of-sight phase tracking affects cell-free massive MIMO performance, proposing a realistic Rician fading model with phase uncertainty and deriving practical beamforming solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works assume either perfect or completely unknown LoS phases, but real-world systems have residual phase uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. This creates a gap between idealized assumptions and practical limitations that needs to be addressed for 6G networks.

Method: The authors propose a Rician fading model with LoS components rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a phase-error penalty factor. They derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that handles statistical phase errors, then introduce a virtual uplink model to preserve second-order statistics for tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformer design.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that the framework bridges idealized assumptions with practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks. The proposed approach unifies prior results as special cases (perfect phase knowledge and zero-mean model).

Conclusion: The paper provides a realistic framework for analyzing cell-free massive MIMO with imperfect LoS phase tracking, offering practical beamforming solutions and performance benchmarks that address the gap between theoretical assumptions and real-world implementation challenges in 6G networks.

Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.

TL;DR: This paper extends Gray-Wyner lossy source coding to include perception constraints, deriving the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region for correlated source sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications in image/video compression require reproduced sequences to have distributions close to original sources, motivating perception constraints beyond traditional rate-distortion trade-offs.

Method: Generalizes point-to-point results to Gray-Wyner multi-terminal setting with two correlated sources, integrating distortion and perception analyses using random circular shift operators in encoding/decoding.

Result: Derives optimal trade-off governed by mutual information involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions, establishing first-order asymptotic optimal region.

Conclusion: Successfully extends Gray-Wyner source coding to include perception constraints, providing theoretical foundation for practical compression systems requiring both distortion and perception guarantees.

Abstract: We revisit the Gray-Wyner lossy source coding problem and derive the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region when additional perception constraints are imposed on reproduced source sequences. The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotatable antennas suffer from physical blockages, while IRS suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in BS antenna side-lobe regions. Need to combine both technologies to overcome these limitations.

Method: Propose RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system with 3D rotatable BS antennas. Formulate sum rate maximization problem and solve via alternating optimization algorithm with projected gradient ascent for antenna rotations, closed-form solution for beamforming, and fractional programming for IRS phase shifts.

Result: Numerical results show significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.

Conclusion: The proposed RA-enabled IRS system effectively addresses angular mismatch issues and provides substantial performance improvements in wireless coverage.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) enhances wireless coverage through directional gain steering, yet suffers from performance degradation under physical blockages. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.

### [62] [Polar Orbit Decoding: Universal Parallel Soft Decoding via Automorphism Orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11373)
*Pin-Jing Li,Yu-Chih Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Polar Orbit Decoding (POD) is a universal parallel decoding framework for binary linear block codes that uses automorphism groups to generate diverse decoding trajectories, achieving ML performance with reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-code architectures require multiple decoders in each equipment, increasing hardware complexity. While a universal polar-based decoding framework exists, its parallelization hasn't been addressed, limiting practical implementation.

Method: POD leverages automorphisms of BLBCs to generate an orbit of permutations that create diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after polar transformations. The automorphism group is represented in BSGS form using Schreier-Sims algorithms for efficient orbit traversal.

Result: Simulations on extended BCH and extended Golay codes show POD achieves maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.

Conclusion: POD provides a practical universal parallel decoding framework that addresses the hardware complexity of multi-code architectures while maintaining performance and reducing latency through efficient automorphism orbit traversal.

Abstract: Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop energy-efficient wideband communication systems that balance SNR performance, computational complexity, and analog power consumption, particularly for high-throughput applications.

Method: End-to-end trained neural coded modulation using Walsh-Hadamard interleaved converters, with WH-domain autoencoders trained in short block length regime and benchmarked against neural and conventional baselines including 5G Polar codes.

Result: WH-AE approaches conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power, achieving 29% higher energy efficiency (bit/J) than best neural baseline for same reliability.

Conclusion: WH-domain learning provides a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.

Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by classical information theory folklore about empirical output distributions of good codes and their comparison to optimal output distributions, the authors aim to achieve similar results for quantum codes used for classical communication through noisy quantum channels.

Method: First proves uniqueness of optimal output distribution, then extends vanishing error probability results using classical-inspired techniques, and extends non-vanishing error probability results using second-order converses based on hypercontractivity results for quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.

Result: Successfully extends both vanishing and non-vanishing error probability results from classical to quantum settings, establishing quantum analogues of classical output distribution properties for capacity-achieving codes.

Conclusion: The paper bridges classical information theory results about output statistics to quantum information theory, providing quantum counterparts to classical results about empirical distributions of good codes and their relationship to optimal output distributions.

Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.

*Frederik Walter,Maria Abu-Sini,Nils Weinhardt,Antonia Wachter-Zeh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Coding schemes using static and data-dependent markers achieve >99% reconstruction rates for DNA storage by addressing probabilistic substitution errors and fragmentation in noisy torn paper channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA is promising for archival data storage but suffers from decay processes involving substitution errors and fragmentation of strands, requiring robust coding schemes to ensure reliable data recovery.

Method: Models DNA decay as a noisy torn paper channel with probabilistic substitutions and unordered substring fragmentation. Proposes two coding schemes: static markers embedded in transmitted sequences, and data-dependent markers using hash functions.

Result: Static markers perform better at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers excel at lower noise levels. Both achieve >99% reconstruction rates with no observed false decodings, limited mainly by computational resources.

Conclusion: Marker-based coding schemes effectively address DNA storage decay challenges, with complementary performance characteristics making them suitable for different noise conditions in archival DNA data storage systems.

Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.

TL;DR: This paper studies joint source-channel coding over Markov channels using empirical coordination framework, deriving inner and outer bounds for achievable joint distributions with strictly causal encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand what empirical distributions of source and channel symbols can be induced by coding schemes over Markov channels, particularly with strictly causal encoders that don't have access to past channel states but drive current Markov state evolution.

Method: The authors use empirical coordination framework and introduce a new notion of typicality called "input-driven Markov typicality" with its fundamental properties. They develop single-letter inner and outer bounds for achievable joint distributions, directly exploiting the Markov channel structure rather than relying on blockwise independence arguments.

Result: The main result is single-letter inner and outer bounds for the set of achievable joint distributions that coordinate all symbols in the network. The analysis improves beyond independence-based arguments by directly leveraging the Markov channel structure.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes fundamental limits for joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through empirical coordination, introducing novel typicality concepts that enable better performance than traditional block-Markov coding schemes.

Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale.

### [68] [Do You Trust Me? Cognitive-Affective Signatures of Trustworthiness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10719)
*Gerard Yeo,Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs implicitly encode psychologically grounded trustworthiness signals from web-like narratives without explicit supervision, revealing systematic activation patterns that distinguish high- from low-trust content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs represent perceived trustworthiness in psychologically coherent ways, given their increasing integration into search, recommendation, and conversational systems where trust is crucial for user navigation of online information.

Method: Analyzed instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Examined layer- and head-level activation differences between high- and low-trust texts, conducted probing analyses to detect linearly decodable trust signals, and studied fine-tuning effects.

Result: LLMs systematically encode trust cues during pretraining, with layer- and head-level activation differences distinguishing high- from low-trust texts. Trust signals are linearly decodable, and fine-tuning refines rather than restructures these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self - dimensions central to human trust formation online.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, providing a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trustworthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

### [69] [Building AI Agents to Improve Job Referral Requests to Strangers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10726)
*Ross Chu,Yuting Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents help job seekers write better referral requests using LLM improver and evaluator agents, with RAG enhancing weaker requests by 14% without harming stronger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help job seekers write more effective referral requests in professional online communities by leveraging AI assistance to improve their chances of receiving referrals.

Method: Two-agent system: 1) Improver agent rewrites referral requests using LLM, 2) Evaluator agent measures revision quality using a model trained to predict referral success probability. Enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to prevent harmful edits to strong requests.

Result: LLM revisions increase predicted success rates for weaker requests but reduce them for stronger requests. RAG prevents degradation of strong requests while amplifying improvements for weak ones. Overall, RAG-enhanced LLM increases predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14% without harming stronger requests.

Conclusion: AI agents with RAG can effectively improve referral request quality, providing low-cost signals for promising features before real-world testing, though model-predicted improvements don't guarantee actual referral success.

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

### [70] [ORBITFLOW: SLO-Aware Long-Context LLM Serving with Fine-Grained KV Cache Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10729)
*Xinyue Ma,Heelim Hong,Taegeon Um,Jongseop Lee,Seoyeong Choy,Woo-Yeon Lee,Myeongjae Jeon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORBITFLOW is an adaptive KV cache management system for long-context LLM serving that dynamically optimizes GPU memory usage to meet latency SLOs through fine-grained KV placement decisions and runtime adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serving long-context LLMs faces challenges due to fluctuating memory footprints from varying request lengths and batch compositions during token generation. Existing static KV cache offloading strategies cannot adapt to rapidly shifting memory demands, leading to excessive CPU-to-GPU transfers, latency spikes, and frequent SLO violations.

Method: ORBITFLOW uses a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to keep on GPU for each request within memory constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback and includes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer memory-intensive requests under heavy load to preserve overall SLO attainment.

Result: ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48% respectively, reduces 95th percentile latency by 38%, and achieves up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.

Conclusion: ORBITFLOW effectively addresses the challenges of long-context LLM serving by providing adaptive, fine-grained KV cache management that dynamically optimizes memory usage to meet latency SLOs while significantly improving performance metrics.

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.

### [71] [CTHA: Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture for Stable Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10738)
*Percy Jardine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTHA is a constrained temporal hierarchical architecture that stabilizes multi-time-scale agent coordination by enforcing structured communication manifolds and arbitration mechanisms, reducing failure cascades by 47% and improving sample efficiency 2.3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-time-scale agent architectures improve performance but compromise coordination stability, causing inter-layer conflicts, error propagation, and scalability issues that need to be addressed.

Method: CTHA projects inter-layer communication onto structured manifolds with three key constraints: Message Contract Constraints (typed summary/plan/policy packets), Authority Manifold Constraints (bounding decision spaces by temporal scope), and Arbiter Resolution Constraints (conflict-free multi-layer decision composition).

Result: 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines in complex task execution at scale.

Conclusion: CTHA provides a principled extension of temporal hierarchies that contributes to understanding multi-agent coordination and suggests directions for robust autonomous systems evolution.

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

*Sen Wang,Bangwei Liu,Zhenkun Gao,Lizhuang Ma,Xuhong Wang,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LMEE proposes a lifelong learning framework for embodied agents that unifies exploration cognition and decision-making, with MemoryExplorer method using RL-finetuned MLLM for active memory querying, evaluated on LMEE-Bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied AI tasks focus only on final task completion, neglecting the crucial exploration process and memory utilization needed for lifelong learning in complex environments.

Method: Propose LMEE framework and MemoryExplorer method: fine-tune multimodal LLM via reinforcement learning with multi-task reward (action prediction, frontier selection, QA) to encourage active memory querying and proactive exploration.

Result: MemoryExplorer achieves significant advantages over state-of-the-art embodied exploration models in long-horizon tasks, demonstrating improved memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: LMEE framework successfully unifies exploration and decision-making for lifelong learning, with MemoryExplorer showing promising results in leveraging episodic memory for better embodied task performance.

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using simple trend-based heuristics (increasing, decreasing, constant) to model complex product-innovation processes, avoiding numerical values and creating scenario transition graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimally information-intensive approach for modeling complex product-innovation processes that avoids reliance on numerical values or rough sets, making the analysis more accessible and less data-dependent.

Method: Uses trend-based heuristics expressed as simple patterns (increasing, decreasing, constant) to create models. Solutions are defined as sets of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by transition graphs where system behavior is depicted as paths within these graphs.

Result: Develops a framework where any possible future or past behavior of complex product-innovation systems can be represented as paths within scenario transition graphs, providing a structured way to analyze innovation processes.

Conclusion: The trend-based heuristic approach offers a practical, information-efficient method for modeling complex product-innovation processes, enabling systematic analysis of possible system behaviors through scenario transition graphs.

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

*François Chollet,Mike Knoop,Gregory Kamradt,Bryan Landers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys the 2025 ARC Prize competition results, highlighting the emergence of refinement loops as key to AGI progress, while noting current limitations in knowledge-dependent overfitting and previewing future interactive reasoning challenges in ARC-AGI-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the state of AGI progress through the ARC-AGI benchmark series, particularly examining the 2025 competition results, emerging methods, and limitations of current approaches to abstract reasoning.

Method: The paper conducts a survey analysis of the top-performing methods from the ARC Prize 2025 competition, examines the role of refinement loops (evolutionary program synthesis and application-layer refinements), analyzes frontier AI lab performance, and discusses benchmark contamination issues.

Result: The 2025 competition saw 1,455 teams with top score of 24% on ARC-AGI-2, 90 paper submissions, and emergence of refinement loops as the defining theme. Frontier AI labs now report ARC-AGI performance, establishing it as an industry standard, but current methods remain constrained by knowledge coverage leading to benchmark contamination.

Conclusion: Refinement loops represent significant progress in AGI development, but current reasoning performance is fundamentally limited to knowledge coverage rather than true generalization. The upcoming ARC-AGI-3 will introduce interactive reasoning challenges requiring exploration, planning, memory, and alignment capabilities to address these limitations.

Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes data curation for multimodal reasoning through the DCVLR challenge, showing that difficulty-based selection on aligned data drives performance gains, while dataset size mainly reduces variance and common diversity/synthetic heuristics often degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study effective data curation strategies for multimodal reasoning by isolating dataset selection effects while keeping model and training protocol fixed, using the DCVLR challenge as a controlled experimental framework.

Method: Used the DCVLR challenge setup with fixed model and training protocol, curated a compact dataset primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, conducted post-competition ablations to analyze factors like difficulty-based selection, dataset size, diversity heuristics, and synthetic augmentation.

Result: The submission placed first in the challenge. Difficulty-based example selection on aligned base data was the dominant performance driver. Dataset size didn't reliably improve mean accuracy but reduced run-to-run variance. Diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provided no benefit and often degraded performance.

Conclusion: DCVLR represents a saturation-regime evaluation where alignment and difficulty are key for data-efficient multimodal reasoning, challenging common assumptions about dataset size and diversity heuristics in data curation.

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: AdaMARP is an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework that improves LLM-based character role-playing through immersive message formats and explicit scene management, outperforming commercial LLMs with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM role-playing systems suffer from limited immersion and adaptability, under-modeling dynamic environmental information, assuming static scenes and casts, and lacking support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction.

Method: Proposes AdaMARP framework with: 1) immersive message format interleaving [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech; 2) explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) with rationales; 3) training datasets AdaRPSet for Actor Model and AdaSMSet for orchestration decisions; 4) AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence (8B actor outperforms commercial LLMs); AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions (14B LLM surpasses Claude Sonnet 4.5).

Conclusion: AdaMARP effectively addresses limitations of existing role-playing systems through adaptive multi-agent framework, immersive message formats, and explicit scene management, achieving superior performance with smaller models compared to commercial LLMs.

Abstract: LLM role-playing aims to portray arbitrary characters in interactive narratives, yet existing systems often suffer from limited immersion and adaptability. They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.

*Jiahao Wang,Shuangjia Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADES is a Bayesian optimization method that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample protein variants while considering structural constraints, outperforming existing methods in protein engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein optimization methods struggle with high-dimensional complexity due to epistasis effects and ignore structural constraints, limiting their effectiveness in designing optimized protein variants for biotechnology and medicine.

Method: HADES uses Hamiltonian dynamics for Bayesian optimization, with momentum and uncertainty in physical movements to rapidly explore promising areas. It employs position discretization to propose discrete protein sequences from continuous states, and a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to model structure-function relationships and learn a smoothed landscape.

Result: Extensive experiments show HADES outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics, leveraging mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence to design sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

Conclusion: HADES provides an effective approach for protein engineering that addresses structural constraints and epistasis effects, offering transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine applications.

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BAPO: RL framework that teaches agentic search agents to say "I DON'T KNOW" when reasoning reaches limits, improving reliability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based agentic search systems lack reliability - they rarely admit uncertainty even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limits, leading to plausible but unreliable answers that pose risks in real-world applications.

Method: Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO) with two key components: 1) group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages IDK responses only when reasoning reaches limits, and 2) adaptive reward modulator that suspends this reward during early exploration to prevent exploiting IDK as a shortcut.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Conclusion: BAPO successfully cultivates reliable boundary awareness in agentic search agents without compromising their accuracy, addressing a critical gap in reliability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single agentic capabilities and rely on human feedback, creating scalability bottlenecks. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation of long-horizon real-world scenarios with automated assessment.

Method: Created AgencyBench with 138 tasks across 32 real-world scenarios requiring ~90 tool calls and 1M tokens each. Uses user simulation agents for iterative feedback and Docker sandboxes for visual/functional rubric-based automated evaluation.

Result: Closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Analysis reveals disparities in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and tool-use preferences. Proprietary models perform best in native ecosystems.

Conclusion: AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed highlighting the need for co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. The benchmark and toolkit are publicly released to advance autonomous agent development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

TL;DR: MiCA is a lightweight module that uses causal discovery to infer mobility relations and integrates them into epidemic forecasting models, improving accuracy without heavy computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemic forecasting is crucial for public health, but faces challenges: mobility data is noisy and indirect, while case time series are short and coarse. Heavy mobility-aware models struggle with these data limitations.

Method: Proposes MiCA (Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter) - a lightweight, architecture-agnostic module that: 1) infers mobility relations through causal discovery, 2) integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing, allowing selective use of spatial structure without heavy relational components like GNNs or full attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets (COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, dengue) show MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones with 7.5% average relative error reduction across forecasting horizons, achieving competitive performance with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

Conclusion: MiCA provides an effective solution for integrating mobility information into epidemic forecasting under noisy, data-limited conditions, offering improved accuracy without the computational burden of heavy relational models.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

*Zhezheng Hao,Hong Wang,Jian Luo,Jianqing Zhang,Yuyan Zhou,Qiang Lin,Can Wang,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCreate is an experience-driven framework that automatically creates domain agents by learning from interaction histories, outperforming human-designed agents and existing automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent creation is labor-intensive and domain-specific, while existing automated approaches treat agent generation as black-box processes that ignore critical evidence from execution experiences and require high computational costs.

Method: ReCreate uses an agent-as-optimizer paradigm with three components: (1) experience storage/retrieval for on-demand inspection, (2) reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits, and (3) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns.

Result: ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods across diverse domains, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Conclusion: The experience-driven approach of ReCreate enables effective automatic creation and adaptation of domain agents by systematically leveraging interaction histories, providing a scalable solution for agent generation in the wild.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

*Zixu Wang,Bingbing Xu,Yige Yuan,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCALE is a low-cost task-level workflow generation framework for multi-agent systems that uses self-prediction with few-shot calibration instead of expensive execution-based evaluation, reducing token usage by up to 83% with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems generate workflows at either task or query level, but their relative costs/benefits are unclear. Query-level workflow generation is often unnecessary, and exhaustive execution-based evaluation is both token-costly and unreliable.

Method: SCALE framework uses self-prediction of the optimizer with few-shot calibration for evaluation instead of full validation execution. It leverages the insight that a small set of top-K best task-level workflows can cover most queries.

Result: SCALE maintains competitive performance with only 0.61% average degradation compared to existing approaches while reducing overall token usage by up to 83% across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Task-level workflow generation with efficient evaluation (SCALE) is a practical alternative to query-level approaches, offering significant cost savings with minimal performance impact for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

### [83] [TANDEM: Temporal-Aware Neural Detection for Multimodal Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178)
*Girish A. Koushik,Helen Treharne,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TANDEM is a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from binary classification into structured reasoning, using tandem reinforcement learning between vision-language and audio-language models to provide interpretable evidence with precise timestamps and target identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hate speech detection systems are "black boxes" that lack granular, interpretable evidence needed for effective human-in-the-loop moderation, especially for long-form multimodal content where harmful narratives are constructed through complex audio, visual, and textual cues.

Method: TANDEM employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, enabling stable reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision.

Result: TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines across three benchmark datasets, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable alignment is achievable in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools, though differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging due to label ambiguity and dataset imbalance.

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A policy-based deep RL hyper-heuristic framework for Job Shop Scheduling that learns to dynamically switch scheduling rules, enhanced with action prefiltering and commitment mechanisms for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) solutions by developing a more intelligent and adaptive scheduling approach that can dynamically select appropriate heuristics based on system state, overcoming limitations of traditional fixed heuristics and static scheduling methods.

Method: A policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework with two key extensions: 1) Action prefiltering to restrict decisions to feasible low-level actions, enabling unbiased heuristic evaluation, and 2) Commitment mechanism to regulate heuristic switching frequency. The framework also compares deterministic greedy vs. stochastic sampling action selection strategies.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods on standard JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating superior makespan performance.

Conclusion: The policy-based deep RL hyper-heuristic framework with action prefiltering and commitment mechanisms provides an effective solution for JSSP, offering dynamic and adaptive scheduling that surpasses existing methods in performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Think-with-Me is a test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention at transitional conjunctions to optimize reasoning efficiency in Large Reasoning Models, reducing reasoning length by 81% while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational costs and degrades performance. Existing methods lack mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process.

Method: The approach pauses reasoning at transitional conjunctions (natural intervention points) for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning. Feedback is generated via multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) from human or LLM proxies. The target model is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization to adapt to this interactive mode.

Result: Think-with-Me achieves superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, it outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive reasoning paradigm effectively addresses inefficiencies in Large Reasoning Models by introducing external feedback intervention at strategic points, enabling more efficient and accurate reasoning while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

TL;DR: XChoice is an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making using mechanism-based modeling rather than just outcome metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation focuses on surface-level outcome agreement (accuracy, F1 scores), but lacks insight into the underlying decision mechanisms and trade-offs that humans make in constrained settings.

Method: Fits mechanism-based decision models to both human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters capturing decision factor importance, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups.

Result: Applied to Americans' daily time allocation using ATUS data, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models/activities and significant misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. Framework validated via invariance analysis and RAG interventions show targeted mitigation potential.

Conclusion: XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching, offering a more nuanced approach to AI-human alignment evaluation.

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored.

AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint programming solver performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameters, and manual tuning is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) probing phase explores hyperparameters using configurable optimization methods (Bayesian optimization or Hamming distance search), 2) solving phase uses best configuration found. Implemented in CPMpy library.

Result: Bayesian optimization outperforms default configurations: improves solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances (matches in 57.9%), and for Choco in 38.6% of instances. Consistently beats Hamming distance search.

Conclusion: Probe and solve algorithm offers practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types, with model-based exploration (Bayesian optimization) superior to simple local search.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework beyond total time prediction and comprehensively evaluate its capabilities across multiple Key Performance Indicators, assessing its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms.

Method: Extension of LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework via prompting, with comprehensive evaluation across three distinct event logs and multiple KPIs (Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction).

Result: In data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses benchmark methods. The LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and internal correlations among training traces, performing higher-order reasoning rather than merely replicating existing predictive methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches show strong potential for Predictive Process Monitoring, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, by leveraging prior knowledge and sophisticated reasoning capabilities beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethiopia needs to upgrade health posts to improve rural access, but limited resources require careful prioritization that must balance quantitative population coverage with diverse stakeholder preferences that are often expressed in natural language rather than formal objectives.

Method: Developed LEG (Large language model and Extended Greedy) framework: combines provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to integrate expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees.

Result: Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing solutions that reflect expert preferences while maintaining coverage guarantees, showing potential for equitable, data-driven health system planning.

Conclusion: The hybrid LEG framework successfully bridges the gap between classical optimization methods requiring explicit quantitative objectives and stakeholder preferences expressed in natural language, offering a practical approach for resource-constrained health system planning in Ethiopia and similar contexts.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

Result: Achieves 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches; generates strategic recommendations comparable to human experts; validated through deployment at 2024 Paris Olympics contributing to Chinese National Team's 3 gold and 2 silver medals.

Conclusion: BoxMind establishes replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

TL;DR: New analytic bijections (cubic rational, sinh, cubic polynomial) and radial flow architecture combine smoothness, global domain, analytic invertibility, and expressivity for normalizing flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalizing flow bijections face trade-offs: affine transforms lack expressivity, monotonic splines are piecewise smooth/bounded, residual flows need numerical inversion. Need expressive scalar bijections that are globally smooth, defined on all ℝ, and analytically invertible.

Method: Introduces three families of analytic bijections (cubic rational, sinh, cubic polynomial) as drop-in replacements in coupling flows. Also develops radial flows - a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms radial coordinate while preserving angular direction.

Result: New bijections match/exceed spline performance in coupling flows. Radial flows show exceptional training stability, geometric interpretability, and on radially-structured targets achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with 1000× fewer parameters. Outperform affine baselines on φ⁴ lattice field theory physics problems.

Conclusion: The proposed analytic bijections combine favorable properties of prior approaches (smoothness, global domain, analytic invertibility, expressivity). Radial flows offer parameter efficiency and interpretability, enabling problem-specific designs that address mode collapse in physics applications.

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

TL;DR: UOWQ is a theoretical framework that jointly optimizes source weights and transfer quantities in multi-source transfer learning to prevent negative transfer and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive uniform transfer from multiple sources can cause negative transfer, and existing methods only optimize either source weights OR transfer quantities, not both jointly.

Method: Formulates multi-source transfer learning as parameter estimation using asymptotic analysis of KL-divergence generalization error. Provides closed-form solutions for single-source case and convex optimization for multi-source case.

Result: Proves using all available source samples is optimal with proper weight adjustment. Outperforms baselines on DomainNet and Office-Home benchmarks in both transfer learning and multi-task learning settings.

Conclusion: UOWQ provides a unified theoretical framework for jointly optimizing source weights and transfer quantities, validated by both theoretical proofs and practical experiments.

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Motivation: Current LLMs suffer from parameter entanglement where reasoning capabilities and factual knowledge exist in superposition within shared weights, leading to the "memory wall" problem where computational capacity is wasted on simulating retrieval and causing hallucinations.

Method: Introduces Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that makes specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applied to Qwen2.5-0.5B model to test the digital metabolism hypothesis.

Result: The model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while showing "structural crystallization" effects. On GSM8K, the metabolized model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought scaffolding, compensating for loss of direct associative recall by shifting from O(1) recall to O(N) reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular "Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM" architectures where logic and memory are separated.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) currently suffer from parameter entanglement, where general reasoning capabilities (logic) and specific factual knowledge (facts) exist in a superposition state within shared weights. This coupling leads to the "memory wall," where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose "digital metabolism," a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent "structural crystallization" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the "metabolized" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular "Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM" architectures.

*Himanshu Thakur,Anusha Kamath,Anurag Muthyala,Dhwani Sanmukhani,Smruthi Mukund,Jay Katukuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for automated feature engineering that addresses dataset scarcity, integration challenges, and human-AI collaboration issues in real-world ML teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code generation models face three main challenges in real-world feature engineering: 1) lack of datasets capturing complex production-level coding processes, 2) poor integration of coding agents with team-specific tools and workflows, and 3) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed feedback.

Method: A planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework where an LLM-powered planner orchestrates agents using a graph representation of the team's environment. The planner generates context-aware prompts, uses downstream failures to correct upstream artifacts, and can request human intervention at critical steps.

Result: 38% improvement over manually crafted workflows and 150% improvement over unplanned workflows on a novel in-house dataset. In production for recommendation models serving 120+ million users, it reduced feature engineering cycles from three weeks to one day.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key adoption barriers for code generation in feature engineering, enabling reliable, maintainable code aligned with team expectations while dramatically accelerating development cycles.

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

### [97] [Mugi: Value Level Parallelism For Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10823)
*Daniel Price,Prabhu Vellaisamy,John Shen,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mugi introduces value-level parallelism (VLP) optimizations for LLMs, improving nonlinear approximations and small-batch GEMMs, achieving significant throughput and energy efficiency gains while reducing carbon footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLP has been proposed for large-batch, low-precision GEMM with symmetric activations and weights, transformer-based LLMs have more sophisticated operations beyond basic GEMM. The paper explores how VLP can benefit these complex LLM operations.

Method: 1) Generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations using a value-centric approach where important values get greater accuracy; 2) Optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs, leveraging LLM optimizations like weight-only quantization, KV cache quantization, and group query attention; 3) Design Mugi architecture to encapsulate these innovations and support full LLM workloads.

Result: Mugi achieves up to 45× throughput and 668× energy efficiency improvements for nonlinear softmax operations, and 2.07× throughput and 3.11× energy efficiency for LLMs. It also reduces operational carbon by 1.45× and embodied carbon by 1.48× for LLM operations.

Conclusion: The Mugi architecture demonstrates that VLP can be effectively adapted for LLMs, providing substantial performance, efficiency, and sustainability benefits across various LLM operations including nonlinear approximations and small-batch GEMMs.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI co-pilot for topology optimization predicts user's preferred modification regions using ML, reducing iterative trials and improving design outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-in-the-loop topology optimization suffers from time-consuming iterative region selection bottlenecks, hindering widespread adoption despite its potential for high-performance structural design.

Method: U-Net architecture configured as image segmentation task, trained on synthetic datasets of human preferences (identifying longest topological member or most complex structural connection) to predict modification regions.

Result: Model successfully predicts plausible modification regions, generalizes across diverse TO problems, and enables 39% improvement in linear buckling load with only 15 sec additional design time compared to conventional TO.

Conclusion: AI co-pilot integration into human-in-the-loop TO reduces iterative trials while maintaining user interaction, making high-performance structural design more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

### [99] [Beyond Accuracy: A Stability-Aware Metric for Multi-Horizon Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10863)
*Chutian Ma,Grigorii Pomazkin,Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new scoring metric (forecast AC score) that balances both accuracy and temporal consistency in probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts, and demonstrates its effectiveness by training seasonal ARIMA models that achieve 75% reduction in forecast volatility while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods focus only on accuracy, neglecting temporal consistency - how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. This creates unstable forecasts that change unpredictably over time.

Method: The authors introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score), a differentiable objective function that measures probabilistic multi-horizon forecast quality by accounting for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The score allows user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements.

Result: When implemented as a training objective for seasonal ARIMA models on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset, the AC-optimized models achieve a 75% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation.

Conclusion: The forecast AC score provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and training forecasting models that consider both accuracy and temporal consistency, leading to more stable and reliable forecasts without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint for gauge-invariant optimization in positively homogeneous neural networks, replacing Euclidean transpose to ensure consistent steepest descent and backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks with positively homogeneous nonlinearities (like ReLU) have gauge symmetry (invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings), but standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations.

Method: Formulates invariance requirement at the level of backward adjoint/optimization geometry, replacing Euclidean transpose with Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint to derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backpropagation.

Result: Provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state, enabling gauge-consistent optimization.

Conclusion: The UC adjoint approach offers a complementary solution to prior rescaling-invariant optimization schemes, addressing gauge symmetry issues in positively homogeneous neural networks at the optimization geometry level.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.

TL;DR: Action Shapley is a new metric for selecting training data for world models in reinforcement learning, with an efficient algorithm that reduces computational complexity by over 80% compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are crucial for RL in costly/dangerous environments, but their effectiveness depends on training data quality. Current methods lack systematic, unbiased data selection metrics.

Method: Introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for training data selection, with a randomized dynamic algorithm to overcome exponential complexity of traditional Shapley value computations.

Result: The algorithm achieves >80% computational efficiency improvement over exponential-time methods. Action Shapley-based selection consistently outperforms ad-hoc data selection across five real-world case studies.

Conclusion: Action Shapley provides an effective, efficient solution for training data selection in world models, improving both computational performance and model quality in data-constrained RL scenarios.

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vessel navigation relies heavily on human experience, lacks autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that compromise safety and sustainability in maritime transport. There's a need for intelligent systems that can optimize both environmental impact (GHG emissions) and social aspects (navigational safety).

Method: Proposes a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with: 1) A realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment using real-world vessel movement data enhanced with a Diffusion Model for dynamic maritime conditions, 2) A machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module using historical operational data and learning-based regression, 3) Image-based environment representation to capture spatial complexity, 4) A lightweight policy-based CRL agent with comprehensive reward mechanisms considering safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion.

Result: The framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. Validation in the Indian Ocean sea area demonstrates efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional vessel navigation by providing an autonomous, emission-aware system that optimizes both sustainability (environmental impact) and safety, validated through realistic marine simulations in the Indian Ocean.

Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAConvLSTM improves ConvLSTM2D by factorizing gates with bottlenecks and depthwise mixing, adding multi-scale branches and axial attention for teleconnections, reducing computation while enhancing spatial modeling and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM2D has limitations for Earth observation data: high computational cost from dense convolutional gating, limited receptive fields for long-range spatial structure, and poor modeling of disentangled climate dynamics with strong local dynamics, teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity.

Method: FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gates using lightweight 1×1 bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing. It adds multi-scale dilated depthwise branches with squeeze-and-excitation recalibration, peephole connections, lightweight axial spatial attention applied sparsely in time, and a dedicated subspace head with temporal self-attention using fixed seasonal positional encoding.

Result: Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data show FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM serves as an effective drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability for Earth observation data analysis.

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

### [104] [HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940)
*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOSL is a hybrid-order split learning framework that combines zeroth-order optimization on clients with first-order optimization on servers to reduce memory usage while maintaining competitive performance for edge-device LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split learning systems use first-order optimization requiring clients to store activations for backpropagation, causing substantial memory overhead that negates benefits of model partitioning. Zeroth-order optimization reduces memory but suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance.

Method: HOSL strategically integrates zeroth-order optimization on client side (eliminating backpropagation and activation storage) with first-order optimization on server side. Uses memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at clients while servers perform FO optimization for fast convergence.

Result: Reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7× compared to FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of baseline. Outperforms ZO baseline by up to 15.55%. Theoretically achieves O(√(d_c/TQ)) convergence rate dependent on client-side dimension rather than full model dimension.

Conclusion: HOSL effectively addresses the trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness in split learning, enabling memory-efficient training on edge devices while maintaining competitive performance through hybrid-order optimization strategy.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Renewable energy integration creates challenges due to generation variability. Accurate forecasting is crucial for power system reliability, stability, and economic efficiency, but traditional methods like deterministic approaches and stochastic programming with K-means clustering fail to capture complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns in RES data.

Method: Multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network that captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different renewable energy sources using historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy.

Result: The proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions and more reliable supply of electric loads, as demonstrated in the case study.

Conclusion: The multivariate LSTM model effectively addresses the limitations of traditional forecasting methods by capturing complex temporal patterns and spatial dependencies, leading to improved renewable energy integration and power system performance.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

*Ning Yang,Yikuan Zhang,Qi Ouyang,Chao Tang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD's preference for flatter minima stems from a nonequilibrium mechanism where noise reshapes the loss landscape into an effective potential favoring flat solutions, with a transient freezing mechanism that traps dynamics in single basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why stochastic gradient descent (SGD) consistently finds flatter, more generalizable solutions in deep learning, despite the unclear dynamical origins of this preference.

Method: Analyzed SGD learning dynamics through numerical experiments revealing transient exploratory phases, used a tractable physical model to show how SGD noise reshapes the loss landscape into an effective potential, and identified a transient freezing mechanism where growing energy barriers suppress transitions between valleys.

Result: SGD noise creates an effective potential favoring flat minima, with a freezing mechanism that traps dynamics in single basins as training progresses. Increasing SGD noise delays freezing and enhances convergence to flatter minima.

Conclusion: Provides a unified physical framework linking SGD dynamics, loss landscape geometry, and generalization, offering principles for designing more effective optimization algorithms based on understanding the nonequilibrium mechanism of solution selection.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: MGF-RL framework combines meta-learning with evolutionary strategies for adaptive load restoration in distribution grids, achieving better generalization and faster adaptation than standard RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restoring critical loads after extreme events is challenging due to renewable generation uncertainty, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics. Standard RL methods generalize poorly and require extensive retraining for new scenarios.

Method: Meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios. Combines first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies for scalable policy search without gradient computation.

Result: Outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control in reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency. Generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns with substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes.

Conclusion: MGF-RL provides an effective solution for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids, with theoretical regret bounds supporting its adaptation efficiency based on task similarity and environmental variation.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

TL;DR: Lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision improves fix type classification in small program repair models without increasing size/complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small code models are resource-efficient but produce single predictions, making it unclear if they learn meaningful program structure or just shallow correlations. Need to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Method: Propose reasoning distillation: large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. Train CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on IntroClass benchmark.

Result: Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, especially on less frequent bug categories. Correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions but don't fully determine them.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

*Kisung You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This note clarifies how constant rescaling of Riemannian metrics affects computational quantities while preserving core geometric structures like connections and geodesics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constant metric rescaling appears frequently in computational settings but its effects are often unclear or confused with changes in curvature or manifold structure. The authors aim to provide a clear, self-contained explanation of what changes and what remains invariant under such scaling.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical exposition distinguishing between quantities that change under constant metric scaling (norms, distances, volume elements, gradient magnitudes) and geometric objects that remain invariant (Levi-Civita connection, geodesics, exponential/logarithmic maps, parallel transport). They analyze the implications for Riemannian optimization.

Result: The analysis shows that constant metric scaling can be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes in optimization rather than a modification of underlying geometry. This clarifies how to introduce global scale parameters in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric foundations.

Conclusion: Constant metric scaling is a useful computational tool that affects certain quantities while preserving essential geometric structures. Understanding this distinction allows practitioners to safely introduce scale parameters in Riemannian algorithms without compromising geometric integrity.

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

### [111] [Combating Spurious Correlations in Graph Interpretability via Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11021)
*Kecheng Cai,Chenyang Xu,Chao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-reflection framework to improve interpretability on challenging Spurious-Motif graph datasets by iteratively feeding importance scores back into existing methods, similar to LLM self-reflection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretable graph learning methods struggle with Spurious-Motif datasets that contain deliberate spurious correlations, showing significantly worse performance compared to other benchmarks. There's a need to improve interpretability on these challenging datasets.

Method: Proposes a self-reflection framework that integrates with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When a method produces importance scores for nodes/edges, the framework feeds these predictions back into the original method for a second round of evaluation. Also proposes a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

Result: The self-reflection technique, adapted from large language models, can effectively enhance interpretability on datasets with strong spurious correlations. The iterative reassessment process helps distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns.

Conclusion: Self-reflection techniques can be successfully adapted from LLMs to improve interpretable graph learning on challenging datasets with spurious correlations, with both inference-time and training-time applications.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

*Sravan Danda,Aditya Challa,Shlok Mehendale,Snehanshu Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an architecture-agnostic test-time adaptation method using an adapter network with quantile loss to handle distribution shifts, validated on corrupted datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing TTA approaches modify classifier weights and are heavily architecture-dependent, making them difficult to extend to generic architectures. There's a need for architecture-agnostic methods.

Method: Adds an adapter network that pre-processes input images, trained using quantile loss to correct distribution shifts by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. The approach is architecture-agnostic.

Result: Validated on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C datasets using both convolutional and transformer networks trained on clean datasets. Theoretical proof shows minimizing quantile loss can learn optimal adapter under suitable conditions.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel architecture-agnostic TTA approach using adapter networks with quantile loss, offering theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness across different architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

*Xinru Wen,Weizhong Lin,zi liu,Xuan Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AVP-Pro is a two-stage framework for antiviral peptide identification that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both general AVP identification and functional subtype prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity between positive and negative peptide sequences.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Panoramic feature space with 10 descriptors + hierarchical fusion architecture (self-attention + adaptive gating) combining CNN-extracted local motifs and BiLSTM-captured global dependencies; 2) OHEM-driven contrastive learning enhanced by BLOSUM62 to sharpen discriminative power for similar sequences.

Result: First stage: 0.9531 accuracy and 0.9064 MCC, outperforming SOTA methods. Second stage: Accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions using transfer learning.

Conclusion: AVP-Pro provides a powerful, interpretable tool for high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs, with a user-friendly web interface available for accessibility.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

### [114] [Self-Augmented Mixture-of-Experts for QoS Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11036)
*Kecheng Cai,Chao Peng,Chenyang Xu,Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-augmented mixture-of-experts model for QoS prediction that uses iterative refinement through partial masking of predictions to address data sparsity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QoS prediction is fundamental for service computing and personalized recommendation, but suffers from inherent sparsity of user-service interactions where only a small subset of feedback values is observed.

Method: Proposes a self-augmented strategy where the model's own predictions are partially masked and fed back for iterative refinement. Designs a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model with multiple expert networks that iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values through inter-expert communication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Conclusion: The iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication, effectively addressing the sparsity challenge in QoS prediction through collaborative refinement.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

*Lecheng Yan,Ruizhe Li,Guanhua Chen,Qing Li,Jiahui Geng,Wenxi Li,Vincent Wang,Chris Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR boosts LLM reasoning but models like Qwen 2.5 gain performance even with incorrect rewards due to a "Perplexity Paradox" - answer perplexity drops while prompt coherence degrades, revealing memorization shortcuts via hidden Anchor-Adapter circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent evidence shows that models achieve significant gains with RLVR even when rewards are spurious or incorrect, suggesting models might be bypassing reasoning through memorization shortcuts rather than genuine reasoning improvement.

Method: Used Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations to investigate the phenomenon, uncovering a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit with Functional Anchor in middle layers (L18-20) triggering memorized solution retrieval and Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) transforming representations.

Result: Identified the "Perplexity Paradox" where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, revealing models bypass reasoning via memorization. Found specific MLP keys in the circuit that allow bidirectional causal steering to artificially amplify or suppress contamination-driven performance.

Conclusion: Provides a mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVR-tuned models by understanding how hidden circuits facilitate memorization shortcuts rather than genuine reasoning improvement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance. Our results provide a mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVR-tuned models.

*Rongkun Cui,Nana Zhang,Kun Zhu,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIMVH is a hippocampus-inspired multi-view hypergraph learning model that improves web finance fraud detection by addressing fraud camouflage and long-tailed data distribution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online financial services face significant fraud threats that harm users and erode trust. Existing GNN-based methods struggle with fraud camouflage (malicious transactions mimicking benign behaviors) and long-tailed data distributions that obscure rare fraudulent cases.

Method: HIMVH uses two hippocampus-inspired modules: (1) cross-view inconsistency perception module (inspired by hippocampus scene conflict monitoring) to capture subtle discrepancies across transaction views and detect camouflaged fraud, and (2) novelty-aware hypergraph learning module (inspired by CA1 region match-mismatch novelty detection) that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages to detect rare fraud patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets show HIMVH achieves average improvements of 6.42% in AUC, 9.74% in F1, and 39.14% in AP over 15 state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HIMVH effectively addresses key challenges in web finance fraud detection by drawing inspiration from hippocampal mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in detecting both camouflaged and rare fraudulent behaviors in long-tailed financial transaction data.

Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.

TL;DR: Soft-BCT introduces probabilistic context splits for real-valued time series, outperforming previous deterministic-split BCT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Bayesian context tree (BCT) models for real-valued time series use hard, deterministic splits of context space, which may be too rigid. The authors propose a more flexible approach with probabilistic splits to better capture complex dependencies.

Method: Develops Soft-BCT with soft (probabilistic) context space splits instead of hard splits. Uses variational inference for learning algorithm implementation.

Result: Soft-BCT demonstrates comparable or superior performance to previous BCT models on real-world datasets, showing the effectiveness of probabilistic context splits.

Conclusion: Soft-BCT provides a more flexible and effective alternative to traditional BCT for real-valued time series through probabilistic context modeling, with practical learning via variational inference.

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SFT: A two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that reduces DP noise impact by injecting noise only into task-specific low-dimensional subspaces, improving accuracy and stability while maintaining privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive data requires privacy protection via differential privacy, but naive noise injection across high-dimensional parameter space degrades performance and destabilizes training due to large noise perturbations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Identify low-dimensional task-specific subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions; 2) Project full gradients onto subspace, add DP noise, map perturbed gradients back to original parameter space for model updates.

Result: Experiments show DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: DP-SFT effectively reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees by focusing noise injection on task-specific subspaces, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-based constraint generation for text clustering using constraint sets instead of pairwise constraints, reducing LLM queries by 20x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional constraint-based clustering requires manual pairwise constraints (must-link/cannot-link), which is resource-intensive. LLMs can generate constraints automatically, but existing methods are query-inefficient and may produce inaccurate constraints.

Method: 1) Generate constraint sets rather than pairwise constraints to reduce LLM queries; 2) Develop constrained clustering algorithm with confidence threshold and penalty mechanism to handle potentially inaccurate LLM-generated constraints.

Result: Achieves clustering accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing LLM queries by more than 20 times across five text datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables efficient and accurate constraint-based clustering using LLMs, making it practical for real-world applications by significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining clustering quality.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

TL;DR: S2NO neural operator enables high-fidelity shape morphing prediction on complex geometries through spectral-spatial encoding and evolutionary optimization for voxel-level material distribution design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shape-morphing methods struggle with accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries needed for advanced applications like conformal implant deployment and aerodynamic morphing.

Method: Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO) integrates Laplacian eigenfunction encoding for global behavior and spatial convolutions for local behavior, combined with evolutionary algorithms for voxel-level material distribution optimization.

Result: S2NO enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures, with discretisation-invariant property allowing super-resolution material distribution design.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing, expanding diversity and complexity of morphing designs for advanced applications.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

### [122] [FSL-BDP: Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy for Credit Risk Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11134)
*Sultan Amed,Tanmay Sen,Sayantan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) enables cross-institutional credit risk modeling without sharing sensitive borrower data, addressing regulatory constraints while improving default prediction accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two key limitations in credit risk modeling: 1) Traditional binary classification ignores default timing, treating early and late defaulters equally despite different loss implications, and 2) Centralized training violates emerging data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA) that prohibit cross-border data sharing, even though cross-institutional learning would benefit model performance.

Method: Proposes Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP). The framework models time-to-default trajectories using federated learning (no centralized data sharing) and provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy guarantees, allowing institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics while protecting sensitive borrower information.

Result: Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show federation fundamentally changes privacy mechanism effectiveness. While classical DP outperforms Bayesian DP in centralized settings, Bayesian DP benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0% vs +1.4%), achieving near parity with non-private performance and outperforming classical DP for most participating clients. This ranking reversal highlights that privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in target deployment architecture rather than centralized benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments. FSL-BDP enables compliant cross-institutional credit risk modeling while maintaining model performance, with Bayesian DP being particularly effective in federated settings compared to classical DP.

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

### [123] [Context-aware Graph Causality Inference for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11135)
*Van Thuy Hoang,O-Joun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaMol is a context-aware graph causality inference framework for few-shot molecular property prediction that uses causal inference to identify key functional groups causally linked to properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot molecular property prediction methods using in-context learning fail to exploit prior knowledge of functional groups causally linked to properties and cannot identify key substructures directly correlated with properties.

Method: Three key components: (1) context graph encoding chemical knowledge linking functional groups, molecules, and properties; (2) learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones; (3) distribution intervener applying backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders.

Result: CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks across diverse molecular datasets, showing strong generalizability to unseen properties. The discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups.

Conclusion: CaMol effectively addresses few-shot molecular property prediction by integrating causal inference with chemical knowledge, providing both improved performance and interpretable causal substructure discovery aligned with domain expertise.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

*P. Sánchez,K. Reyes,B. Radu,E. Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of supervised classification vs. unsupervised autoencoder approaches for helicopter engine predictive maintenance, showing supervised performs better with labeled data but autoencoders work well without fault labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned helicopter engine failures cause operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs, necessitating effective predictive maintenance strategies to mitigate these risks.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Supervised classification pipeline using labeled normal/faulty data, and 2) Unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoders trained only on healthy engine data to detect deviations as potential faults. Both evaluated on real-world helicopter engine telemetry dataset.

Result: Supervised models perform strongly when annotated failure data is available, while autoencoders achieve effective detection without requiring fault labels, making them suitable for settings with scarce or incomplete failure data.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and demonstrates unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications where labeled failure data is limited.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

### [125] [Theoretically and Practically Efficient Resistance Distance Computation on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11159)
*Yichun Yang,Longlong Lin,Rong-Hua Li,Meihao Liao,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two new algorithms (Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push) for computing resistance distances on large graphs that significantly improve efficiency by reducing dependence on the graph Laplacian's condition number κ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resistance distance computation is crucial for graph analysis tasks like clustering and link prediction, but existing methods are inefficient for large graphs, especially when the graph Laplacian has a large condition number (κ), leading to slow convergence.

Method: Proposed two Lanczos-inspired algorithms: 1) Lanczos Iteration - a near-linear time global algorithm with complexity Õ(√κ m), and 2) Lanczos Push - a local algorithm with complexity Õ(κ^{2.75}) independent of graph size.

Result: Lanczos Iteration achieves √κ speedup over previous global methods, while Lanczos Push improves by κ^{0.25} over state-of-the-art local algorithms. Both algorithms outperform existing methods in efficiency and accuracy across eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Lanczos-based algorithms provide efficient solutions for resistance distance computation on large graphs, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling better scalability for graph analysis applications.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

### [126] [Clustering High-dimensional Data: Balancing Abstraction and Representation Tutorial at AAAI 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11160)
*Claudia Plant,Lena G. M. Bauer,Christian Böhm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the fundamental trade-off between abstraction and representation in clustering algorithms, analyzing how different approaches balance these conflicting goals and proposing future directions for more adaptive clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering requires balancing abstraction (removing superfluous details) with representation (preserving key distinguishing features). Current algorithms implement different trade-offs, but finding the optimal balance remains challenging, especially for high-dimensional and complex data.

Method: The paper analyzes existing clustering approaches: K-means (high abstraction, simple representation), subspace clustering (richer representations for high-dimensional data), and deep clustering (using centroid-based and density-based losses to enforce abstraction). It also proposes using separate latent spaces - one for clustering-relevant information and another for other data information.

Result: The analysis shows that increasing representational expressiveness requires explicit enforcement of abstraction in the objective function to ensure proper clustering rather than just representation learning. Subspace clustering ideas help by learning separate latent spaces for different types of information.

Conclusion: Future clustering methods need to more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency, and interpretability. The human brain's ability to automatically find this balance suggests there's significant room for improvement in clustering algorithms.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

### [127] [GMM-COMET: Continual Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation via a Mean Teacher and Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Pseudo-Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11161)
*Pascal Schlachter,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMM-COMET is the first method for continual source-free universal domain adaptation, adapting sequentially to multiple unlabeled target domains without access to source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often involve multiple domain shifts where source data becomes unavailable during adaptation, and target domains may have different label spaces. Existing SF-UniDA methods only handle single domain shifts, but practical scenarios require adaptation to sequential streams of different target domains.

Method: Combines Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling with a mean teacher framework for stability in long adaptation sequences. Adds consistency losses for robustness. Builds upon previous online SF-UniDA methods.

Result: GMM-COMET provides the first strong baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach that consistently improves upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the challenging continual SF-UniDA problem and establishes a foundation for future research in sequential multi-domain adaptation without source data access.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

TL;DR: Unsupervised autoencoder models (feed-forward and LSTM) detect hydraulic pump faults early using only healthy training data, achieving high reliability despite no fault samples in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps cause production halts and substantial costs, creating a need for early fault detection systems that can operate without labeled fault data.

Method: Two unsupervised autoencoder schemes: 1) feed-forward model analyzing individual sensor snapshots, and 2) LSTM model capturing short temporal windows. Both trained only on healthy data from 52 sensor channels at minute-level logging.

Result: Models achieve high reliability in detecting seven annotated fault intervals despite being trained exclusively on healthy data without any fault samples.

Conclusion: Unsupervised autoencoder approaches using only healthy training data can effectively detect hydraulic pump faults early, offering practical solutions for industrial maintenance without requiring labeled fault data.

Abstract: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps can halt production and incur substantial costs. We explore two unsupervised autoencoder (AE) schemes for early fault detection: a feed-forward model that analyses individual sensor snapshots and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that captures short temporal windows. Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address structural complexity of time series (multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components) that remains insufficiently addressed in current generative modeling approaches for time series analysis.

Method: Proposes a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework: 1) Encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions, 2) Uses autoregressive generation in coarse-to-fine manner to preserve hierarchical dependencies, 3) Introduces dual-path VQ-VAE to disentangle trend and seasonal components for semantically consistent latent representations, 4) Implements guidance-based reconstruction strategy where coarse seasonal signals guide fine-grained seasonal pattern reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show the approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods, achieves strong performance with significantly reduced parameter count, and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses structural complexity in time series generation through multiscale encoding, component disentanglement, and guided reconstruction, offering improved quality and efficiency for time series generative modeling.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences.

*Haiyang Xiao,Weiqing Li,Jinyue Guo,Guochao Jiang,Guohua Liu,Yuewei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAQ is a calibration data regeneration framework that uses larger LLMs from the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples, improving post-training quantization accuracy by up to 28.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PTQ methods rely on limited calibration samples that fail to capture the full activation distribution during inference, leading to biased quantization parameters and accuracy loss.

Method: FAQ inputs original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family to regenerate high-fidelity calibration data with consistent knowledge. The regenerated data undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance standard PTQ.

Result: Experiments on multiple model series including Qwen3-8B show FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5% compared to baseline methods using original calibration data.

Conclusion: FAQ effectively addresses the calibration data bottleneck in PTQ by leveraging family knowledge to generate representative samples, demonstrating strong potential for improving quantization accuracy in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

*Zhikang Shen,Jianrong Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Jianhai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDFLoRA addresses rank heterogeneity in federated learning for LLMs by decomposing client adapters into global and local modules, enabling better aggregation and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical FL deployments exhibit rank heterogeneity where different clients use different low-rank configurations, making direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions over-constrain client-specific semantics and provide weak privacy protection.

Method: Proposes Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) which decomposes each client adapter into a global module (captures transferable knowledge) and a local module (preserves client-specific adaptations). Global modules are selectively aligned and aggregated, while local modules remain private.

Result: Experiments on GLUE benchmarks show SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves better utility-privacy trade-off.

Conclusion: SDFLoRA enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module, improving both performance and privacy protection.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

TL;DR: MAD-BNO: A novel operator learning framework using only boundary data synthesized from fundamental solutions, eliminating need for full-domain sampling or external simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional operator learning methods often require full-domain sampling which can be computationally expensive. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach that uses only boundary data while maintaining physical consistency.

Method: Integrates Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method to synthesize training data from fundamental solutions. Learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. After training, recovers interior solutions through boundary integral formulations.

Result: Validated on 2D Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations. Achieves comparable or better accuracy than existing neural operators while significantly reducing training time. Framework is extensible to 3D problems and complex geometries.

Conclusion: MAD-BNO provides an efficient, data-driven operator learning framework that uses only boundary data, reduces computational costs, and maintains physical consistency through fundamental solutions.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

*Pingzhi Tang,Yiding Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaST framework enables efficient knowledge adaptation in LLMs by transferring reasoning skills from source to target domains, addressing the knowledge cutoff problem without expensive RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from knowledge cutoff issues where they can't internalize new information. SFT updates facts but doesn't improve reasoning skills, while RL is too computationally expensive for online adaptation.

Method: Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST) extracts domain-agnostic Skill Vectors from source domains, then linearly injects these knowledge manipulation skills into target models after lightweight SFT on new data.

Result: PaST outperforms SFT baselines by up to 9.9 points on SQuAD, achieves 8.0-point gain on LooGLE long-context QA, and improves ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with strong cross-domain transferability.

Conclusion: PaST provides an efficient framework for knowledge adaptation that separates skill learning from factual updates, enabling effective reasoning skill transfer across domains without expensive RL training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based MOR methods fail to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, either overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information.

Conclusion: LD-GCN provides an effective encoder-free approach for nonlinear MOR that combines geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent dynamics, enabling time-extrapolation and zero-shot prediction while maintaining mathematical rigor and practical applicability to complex PDE systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation.

Motivation: Boosting is well-understood in classic settings but less so in agnostic cases where no data assumptions are made. Recent work settled sample complexity but with exponential runtime.

Method: Proposed a new agnostic boosting algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity while running in polynomial time relative to sample size (with other parameters fixed).

Result: First agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity that runs in polynomial time, overcoming the exponential runtime limitation of previous approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient practical solution for agnostic boosting, bridging the gap between theoretical sample complexity bounds and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

Conclusion: Combining metabolomics with interpretable machine learning provides translational framework for objective, biologically informed ADHD diagnostics with potential for point-of-care applications.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

TL;DR: FORESTLLM is a novel framework that combines decision forests with LLMs for few-shot tabular learning, using LLMs only during training to design lightweight, interpretable forest models without LLM inference at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tree-based methods struggle in few-shot settings due to unstable statistical purity metrics, while LLMs often ignore tabular data structure. There's a need for methods that work effectively with scarce labeled examples in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare.

Method: Two-fold approach: 1) Semantic splitting criterion where LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on coherence over labeled/unlabeled data, 2) One-time in-context inference for leaf node stabilization where LLM distills decision paths into deterministic predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse few-shot classification and regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: FORESTLLM successfully unifies structural inductive biases of decision forests with semantic reasoning of LLMs, creating robust, interpretable models for few-shot tabular learning without requiring LLM inference at test time.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SPREAD is a novel framework that addresses Response Semantic Drift in Diffusion Language Models within Retrieval-Augmented Generation by introducing query-relevance-guided denoising to maintain semantic alignment with queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown great success for enhancing large language models, its potential hasn't been well explored for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) due to fundamental differences in decoding mechanisms. DLMs with RAG show promise but suffer from limited generation precision due to Response Semantic Drift.

Method: The paper proposes SPREAD (Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. This approach actively guides the denoising trajectory to ensure generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses semantic drift.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates Response Semantic Drift of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Conclusion: SPREAD successfully addresses the key limitation of DLMs in RAG frameworks by maintaining semantic alignment with queries throughout the iterative denoising process, enabling more precise and semantically consistent generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEATHer is an ultra-lightweight time-series forecasting model for edge devices that uses frequency decomposition and efficient kernels to achieve accurate long-term forecasting with as few as 400 parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial automation requires time-series forecasting models that can run on resource-constrained edge devices (PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict latency and memory limits (few thousand parameters), making conventional deep architectures impractical.

Method: FEATHer introduces: 1) multiscale frequency decomposition, 2) shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection (no recurrence/attention), 3) frequency-aware branch gating for adaptive fusion, and 4) Sparse Period Kernel for seasonality capture via period-wise downsampling.

Result: Achieves best ranking across 8 benchmarks with 60 first-place results and average rank of 2.05, outperforming baselines while maintaining compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters).

Conclusion: Reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering practical direction for industrial real-time inference with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

*Akhilesh Raj,Swann Perarnau,Aniruddha Gokhale,Solomon Bekele Abera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline reinforcement learning for autonomous CPU power control improves energy efficiency with minimal performance impact, avoiding online RL challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency is crucial for modern computing infrastructure, but online RL training for power controllers faces challenges like lack of simulation models and reliability issues on live systems.

Method: Uses offline RL with pre-collected state transition data, combining gray-box approach with application-agnostic performance data (heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to control CPU power via Intel's Running Average Power Limit.

Result: Offline-trained agent substantially reduces energy consumption with tolerable performance degradation across compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks on live systems.

Conclusion: Offline RL provides a viable alternative to online RL for autonomous CPU power control, enabling energy efficiency improvements without the reliability and training challenges of online approaches.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

*Emma Hart,Bas Peters,Julianne Chung,Matthias Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paired autoencoders with learned latent space mappings handle data inconsistencies in inverse problems, enabling robust parameter estimation from partial/noisy/OOD data while maintaining physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems often face observational inconsistencies (partial, noisy, out-of-distribution data) that degrade parameter estimation. Existing methods struggle to maintain physical consistency while handling these data issues effectively.

Method: Two autoencoders (parameter space and observation space) connected by learned mappings between their latent spaces. This enables surrogate regularized inversion in low-dimensional latent spaces, with reconstruction of corrupted data followed by parameter estimation.

Result: More accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders, especially with data inconsistencies. Demonstrated on medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion.

Conclusion: The framework provides flexible, data-driven latent space inference that handles observational inconsistencies while maintaining physical model consistency, broadly applicable to scientific and engineering inverse problems.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

TL;DR: DVF is a factored value function for graph-based MDPs that diffuses rewards over influence graphs, enabling better credit assignment in multi-agent RL with local interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard critics in MARL are poorly aligned with graph-structured interactions: global value functions provide weak per-agent signals, while local constructions are difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings.

Method: Introduces Diffusion Value Function (DVF) that assigns value components by diffusing rewards over influence graphs with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. Proposes DA2C algorithm and LD-GNN actor for decentralized learning under communication costs.

Result: DVF is well-defined, admits Bellman fixed point, decomposes global discounted value. DA2C outperforms local and global critic baselines across firefighting benchmark and distributed computation tasks, improving average reward by up to 11%.

Conclusion: DVF provides an effective factored value function for GMDPs that enables better credit assignment in multi-agent systems with structured local interactions, leading to improved performance in decentralized RL tasks.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

*Lennon Shikhman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FNOs are vulnerable to distribution shifts, boundary changes, and resolution extrapolation, with errors inflating by 10x+ in some cases, though input perturbations generally don't amplify errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fourier Neural Operators show strong PDE solving performance but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood, requiring systematic stress testing.

Method: Systematic stress-testing framework probing FNOs across 5 PDE families with controlled tests: parameter shifts, boundary/terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts.

Result: Distribution shifts in parameters/boundary conditions inflate errors by >10x; resolution changes concentrate error in high-frequency modes; input perturbations generally don't amplify error except worst-case scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning, revealing specific vulnerabilities in FNOs.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep logic gate and lookup table networks achieve 94.28% accuracy for ECG arrhythmia classification with extremely low computational cost (2.89k-6.17k FLOPs) and power consumption (5-7 mW), suitable for implantable/wearable devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop ultra-low-power, high-speed arrhythmia detection systems for heart implants and wearable devices that can operate efficiently on patients not included in training data.

Method: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) with novel preprocessing, rate coding, and MUX-based LUT training, benchmarked on MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using inter-patient paradigm.

Result: Achieved 94.28% accuracy and jκ index of 0.683 on four-class classification, using only 2.89k-6.17k FLOPs (3-6 orders magnitude less than SOTA), requiring 2000-2990 FPGA LUTs and consuming 5-7 mW (50-70 pJ per inference).

Conclusion: LGNs and LUTNs are highly suitable for low-power arrhythmia detection in medical implants/wearables, offering superior performance with minimal computational resources for inter-patient generalization.

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

*Francisco Giral,Álvaro Manzano,Ignacio Gómez,Ricardo Vinuesa,Soledad Le Clainche*

TL;DR: GenDA is a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution urban wind fields from sparse sensor data using a multiscale graph-based diffusion model trained on CFD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban wind flow reconstruction is crucial for air quality assessment, heat dispersion analysis, and pedestrian comfort evaluation, but existing methods struggle with sparse sensor data and complex urban geometries.

Method: GenDA uses a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on CFD simulations. It employs classifier-free guidance where the unconditional branch learns geometry-aware flow priors and the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. The model handles both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations on unstructured meshes.

Result: GenDA reduces relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% compared to supervised GNN baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods. It generalizes across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex urban domains, demonstrating superior performance in reconstructing wind fields from limited observations.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ensembling diffusion models improves likelihood metrics but fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics like FID on image datasets, with theoretical insights provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether ensembling, a well-known technique for improving supervised models, provides tangible benefits for unconditional score-based diffusion models in generative modeling.

Method: Evaluated various ensembling aggregation rules including Deep Ensembles and Monte Carlo Dropout across CIFAR-10 and FFHQ datasets. Also examined tabular data using random forests and provided theoretical analysis of score model composition.

Result: Ensembling scores improves score-matching loss and model likelihood, but fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics (FID) on image datasets. One aggregation strategy outperformed others on tabular data.

Conclusion: While ensembling diffusion models improves likelihood-based metrics, it doesn't reliably improve perceptual quality, highlighting a discrepancy between score estimation quality and image generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRKV reduces KV cache memory by sharing full-rank KV projections across attention heads with low-rank head-specific residuals, achieving better performance with less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache being a major bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding.

Method: Low-rank KV adaptation (LRKV) modifies multi-head attention by using shared full-rank KV projections across heads, augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals. This creates a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.

Result: LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At 2.5B scale, it outperforms standard attention with roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent quality with 20-25% less training compute.

Conclusion: LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention while reducing memory requirements, establishing it as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

TL;DR: This paper implements extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) for energy-efficient, real-time inference on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural extractive summarization systems require energy-intensive CPU/GPU infrastructure, making them unsuitable for real-time inference in resource-constrained edge environments. There's a need for low-power hardware solutions.

Method: 1) Hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms for better quantization robustness; 2) Complete ES pipeline with stochastic rounding and iterative refinement; 3) Decomposition strategy to partition large ES problems into smaller Ising subproblems solvable on COBI.

Result: On CNN/DailyMail dataset: COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups vs brute-force (comparable to Tabu search), 2-3 orders of magnitude energy reduction, while maintaining competitive summary quality with only integer-coupled Ising hardware and limited precision.

Conclusion: CMOS Ising solvers like COBI show strong potential for deploying real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices, offering significant energy savings while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

Conclusion: Quantum ML provides unique advantages for smart grid anomaly detection, offering better modeling of high-dimensional complexities and adversarial resilience. The partitioning framework makes quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical for large-scale smart grid environments.

Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.

TL;DR: Researchers created MetaboNet, a unified T1D dataset combining multiple public datasets with CGM and insulin pump data, offering 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of data for more generalizable algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T1D datasets are fragmented, lack standardization, and are time-consuming to access/process, which limits algorithm development, data integration, and reduces comparability and generalizability of research findings.

Method: Consolidated multiple publicly available T1D datasets into a unified resource (MetaboNet) requiring both CGM data and insulin pump dosing records, with auxiliary data like carbohydrate intake and physical activity retained when available.

Result: Created the largest T1D dataset to date with 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, available as both a fully public subset and DUA-restricted subset with standardized format conversion pipelines.

Conclusion: MetaboNet provides a comprehensive, accessible data resource that covers diverse glycemic profiles and demographics, enabling more generalizable T1D algorithm development than individual datasets alone.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probes for AI misuse mitigation fail to generalize to long-context inputs; new probe architectures address this, with multimax handling context length, and combining architecture choice with diverse training enables broad generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As frontier language models become more powerful, stronger misuse mitigation is needed. Activation probes show promise but fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts, particularly from short-context to long-context inputs.

Method: Propose new probe architectures to handle long-context distribution shift. Evaluate probes in cyber-offensive domain against production-relevant shifts including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Pair probes with prompted classifiers for optimal accuracy at low computational cost.

Result: Multimax addresses context length issues, but broad generalization requires both architecture choice and training on diverse distributions. Probes with prompted classifiers achieve optimal accuracy efficiently. Findings informed deployment in Gemini. AlphaEvolve shows early positive results for automating probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming.

Conclusion: New probe architectures combined with diverse training enable robust misuse mitigation for frontier language models. Automation of AI safety research via AlphaEvolve is already feasible, supporting deployment in production systems like Gemini.

Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.

*Atef Azaiez,Alireza David Anisi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A methodology using Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) to systematically evaluate and select system design concepts for Robotic Autonomous Systems, demonstrated with an agricultural robotics use-case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and reliability are crucial for RAS design, but the complex nature of RAS and dynamic environments make system design concept selection challenging. Current approaches range from ad-hoc practices to systematic MBSE techniques, but there's a need for formal methods to enable systematic evaluation of design concepts.

Method: Proposes applying Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) as a formal method to systematically evaluate and analyze system design concepts. Uses PRISM as the probabilistic model checker and develops a domain-specific Design Evaluation Criteria for agricultural RAS. The methodology leads to Verified Designs (VD).

Result: The methodology is illustrated with a practical RAS concept selection use-case from agriculture robotics, demonstrating how PMC can be applied to evaluate design concepts systematically.

Conclusion: PMC provides a formal, systematic approach to evaluate RAS design concepts, addressing the challenges of complex systems in dynamic environments, and enables selection of verified designs with consideration of safety and reliability from early concept phases.

Abstract: Safety and reliability play a crucial role when designing Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). Early consideration of hazards, risks and mitigation actions -- already in the concept study phase -- are important steps in building a solid foundations for the subsequent steps in the system engineering life cycle. The complex nature of RAS, as well as the uncertain and dynamic environments the robots operate within, do not merely effect fault management and operation robustness, but also makes the task of system design concept selection, a hard problem to address. Approaches to tackle the mentioned challenges and their implications on system design, range from ad-hoc concept development and design practices, to systematic, statistical and analytical techniques of Model Based Systems Engineering. In this paper, we propose a methodology to apply a formal method, namely Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC), to enable systematic evaluation and analysis of a given set of system design concepts, ultimately leading to a set of Verified Designs (VD). We illustrate the application of the suggested methodology -- using PRISM as probabilistic model checker -- to a practical RAS concept selection use-case from agriculture robotics. Along the way, we also develop and present a domain-specific Design Evaluation Criteria for agri-RAS.

TL;DR: Hierarchical control framework combining predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize energy efficiency for wheeled-legged robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wheeled-legged robots combine wheel efficiency with leg versatility but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments.

Method: Hierarchical control with power prediction network forecasting energy consumption over 1-second horizon for gait selection, plus reinforcement learning policy for residual adjustments to fine-tune actions.

Result: Reduces energy consumption by up to 35% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance.

Conclusion: Framework validated through simulations and real-world experiments on modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the versatility of legs, but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments. In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

### [156] [Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Vehicle Platoons with State-Dependent Friction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10724)
*Rishabh Dev Yadav*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot platoons that handles unknown friction forces without prior knowledge of their parameters or structure, maintaining formation despite disturbances and uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot formation control has critical applications but faces challenges with unknown/uncertain friction forces that vary with road conditions, tire wear, and vehicle speed. Existing adaptive controllers struggle with state-dependent friction forces that cannot be a priori bounded.

Method: Proposes a two-stage adaptive sliding mode controller: 1) kinematic controller calculates desired velocities from trajectory, 2) dynamics model generates motion commands. Separates kinematics and dynamics to simplify control and handle unknown friction without prior parameter/structure knowledge.

Result: The controller can regulate platoon speed and maintain predefined inter-robot distances even with external disturbances and uncertain system parameters, effectively handling complex friction behavior.

Conclusion: The approach provides efficient and robust control for wheeled mobile robot platoons by addressing the critical challenge of unknown friction forces through adaptive sliding mode control with separated kinematics and dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.
  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.

TL;DR: Diffusion-based planner for leader-follower formation control in cluttered environments using diffusion policy for leader trajectory generation and distance-constrained formation control for followers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable multi-agent formation planning approach that can handle cluttered environments while producing smooth motions and maintaining formation geometry.

Method: Uses diffusion policy to generate trajectory of midpoint between two leaders as a rigid bar, defining their desired motion paths. Followers use distance-constrained formation controller based on relative positions in local coordinates to track leaders and maintain formation geometry.

Result: The approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free spaces or obstacle configurations not in the training dataset. Simulation results demonstrate potential for reliable multi-agent formation planning.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promising potential for multi-agent formation planning in cluttered environments, though limitations exist with narrow spaces and unseen obstacle configurations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based planner for leader--follower formation control in cluttered environments. The diffusion policy is used to generate the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders as a rigid bar in the plane, thereby defining their desired motion paths in a planar formation. While the followers track the leaders and form desired foramtion geometry using a distance-constrained formation controller based only on the relative positions in followers' local coordinates. The proposed approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free space, or obstacle configurations that are not in the training data set. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.

*Junxiang Wang,Cindy Wang,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Zackory Erickson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BRIDGE enables real-time trajectory modification for physical human-robot interaction using natural language commands and provides verbal feedback, improving interactivity and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are both adaptable to user preferences and transparent about their actions. Current systems lack intuitive bidirectional communication for real-time trajectory modification.

Method: BRIDGE uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language commands for modifying robot trajectories (position, velocity, force) in real time, considering planned motion and conversation history. The system provides verbal feedback - either confirming changes or asking clarifying questions.

Result: In a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, participants successfully modified trajectories in real time. BRIDGE with bidirectional feedback received significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency compared to ablation without verbal feedback and baseline.

Conclusion: Bidirectional verbal feedback is critical for intuitive human-robot interaction. BRIDGE demonstrates that combining natural language trajectory modification with verbal responses creates more transparent and interactive physical assistance systems.

Abstract: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are not only adaptable to user preferences but also transparent about their actions. This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes sim-to-real training for underwater stereo depth estimation and a novel SLAM framework fusing stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and DVL measurements for underwater robot perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater stereo depth estimation is challenging due to light attenuation, visual artifacts, dynamic lighting, and lack of texture. Stereo networks trained on in-air data don't transfer well, and there's a shortage of real underwater stereo datasets for supervised training. Poor depth estimation compounds problems in underwater SLAM.

Method: 1) Sim-to-real training framework using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning for underwater stereo disparity estimation. 2) Development of a novel SLAM framework that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and DVL measurements. 3) Collection of a real-world dataset with 24,000+ stereo pairs, dense photogrammetry models, and reference trajectories.

Result: Demonstrated advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in underwater domain. Enabled accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses underwater stereo depth estimation challenges through sim-to-real training and enables robust underwater SLAM for complex environments like shipwrecks.

Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

*Simin Liu,Tong Zhao,Bernhard Paus Graesdal,Peter Werner,Jiuguang Wang,John Dolan,Changliu Liu,Tao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new two-phase approach for contact-rich manipulation planning that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 61% cost reduction while maintaining high success rates and sub-minute query times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-based planners for contact-rich manipulation focus on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit the efficiency and naturalness advantages of using any surface of the manipulator for contact, not just fingertips.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Offline construction of a graph of mutual reachable sets containing all object orientations reachable from starting orientations and grasps; 2) Online planning over this graph to compute and sequence local plans for globally optimized motion.

Result: Outperforms leading planner by reducing task cost by 61%, achieves 91% success rate across 250 queries, and maintains sub-minute query times on challenging contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: Globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks, enabling more efficient and natural manipulation by fully exploiting the advantages of using any manipulator surface for contact.

Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A minimalist gait phase detection system using a single IMU on crutch handgrip achieves 94% success rate for real-time exoskeleton control, with TCN as best architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower limb exoskeletons need precise real-time gait phase detection, but conventional methods use complex force sensors that cause control latency. Need a simpler, cost-effective solution.

Method: Single low-cost IMU on crutch handgrip, five-phase classification (including non-locomotor state), benchmarked three deep learning architectures on PC/embedded systems, added FSM for biomechanical consistency in data-constrained conditions.

Result: TCN performed best with highest success rates and lowest latency. Achieved 94% success rate detecting crutch steps. Model generalized to paralyzed user despite training only on healthy participants.

Conclusion: System provides high-performance, cost-effective solution for real-time exoskeleton control using minimalist IMU setup with TCN architecture and FSM augmentation.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses require precise, real time gait phase and step detections to ensure synchronized motion and user safety. Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency. The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) emerged as the superior architecture, yielding the highest success rates and lowest latency. Notably, the model generalized to a paralyzed user despite being trained exclusively on healthy participants. Achieving a 94% success rate in detecting crutch steps, this system provides a high performance, cost effective solution for real time exoskeleton control.

*Ludovic Righetti,Vincent Boulanin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses dual-use risks in robotics research, proposing a roadmap for responsible practices including education, risk assessment, moderation of high-risk material dissemination, and establishing red lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While open access in robotics lowers barriers and accelerates development, it also increases dual-use risks for military and harmful applications. Unlike other fields like AI or weapons development, robotics lacks specific regulation and guidance for responsible research dissemination.

Method: The paper proposes a four-practice roadmap: 1) education in responsible robotics, 2) incentivizing risk assessment, 3) moderating diffusion of high-risk material, and 4) developing red lines for unacceptable research.

Result: The paper presents a framework for the robotics community to develop sector-specific guidance and possible regulation to address dual-use risks while maintaining the benefits of open access.

Conclusion: The robotics community needs to proactively develop its own responsible research practices and potentially regulation to mitigate dual-use risks, balancing openness with security concerns through the proposed four-practice roadmap.

Abstract: Open access to publication, software and hardware is central to robotics: it lowers barriers to entry, supports reproducible science and accelerates reliable system development. However, openness also exacerbates the inherent dual-use risks associated with research and innovation in robotics. It lowers barriers for states and non-state actors to develop and deploy robotics systems for military use and harmful purposes. Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation. To that end, we propose a roadmap focusing on four practices: a) education in responsible robotics; b) incentivizing risk assessment; c) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material; and d) developing red lines.

### [163] [Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10930)
*Zhixian Xie,Yu Xiang,Michael Posa,Wanxin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical RL-MPC framework for dexterous manipulation that separates high-level contact intention planning from low-level contact dynamics optimization, achieving high success with 10x less data and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end visuomotor policies for dexterous manipulation require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. The authors address these limitations by recognizing that dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical RL-MPC framework: 1) High-level RL policy predicts contact intention (object-surface contact location and post-contact object-level subgoal pose), 2) Low-level contact-implicit MPC optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that drive the object toward each subgoal.

Result: Achieves near-100% success on non-prehensile tasks (geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation) with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach leveraging the inherent structure of dexterous manipulation successfully addresses key limitations of end-to-end methods, enabling efficient learning, robustness, and sim-to-real transfer by separating geometric/kinematic reasoning from contact dynamics optimization.

Abstract: A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

*HyoJae Kang,SunWoo Ahn,InGyu Choi,GeonYeong Go,KunWoo Son,Min-Sung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A camera-based system for crane operators to see hidden landing zones during load lowering, improving construction site safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: During crane lowering operations, the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point, forcing reliance on ground personnel communication which compromises safety.

Method: An attachable camera module with suction cup mounts directly to the load, containing single-board computer, battery, and camera. It streams and processes ground images in real-time to generate installation guidance, transmitted to a host computer for operator monitoring.

Result: Preliminary experiments with the module attached to a test object confirmed feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission.

Conclusion: The system has potential to significantly improve construction site safety by providing crane operators with instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.

Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission.

*Haishan Zeng,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-AIM is a hierarchical multi-robot planning framework that combines LLMs for instruction parsing with classical planners for optimization, achieving significant performance improvements on complex household tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination for embodied AI tasks, creating a need for better frameworks to enable heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions.

Method: Three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) LLM parses instructions into PDDL problem descriptions, 2) Combines LLM semantic reasoning with classical planner search for optimized action sequences, 3) Compiles plans into behavior trees for reactive control, with shared blackboard for multi-robot communication.

Result: H-AIM achieves dramatic improvements: task success rate increases from 12% to 55%, and goal condition recall improves from 32% to 72% compared to the strongest baseline (LaMMA-P) on the MACE-THOR benchmark with 42 complex tasks.

Conclusion: The H-AIM framework successfully addresses LLM limitations in multi-robot planning by combining semantic reasoning with classical planning, enabling effective coordination of heterogeneous robot teams for complex long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real transfer for large hydraulic robots is challenging due to slow control response, complex fluid dynamics, multiple interconnected cylinders, and varying fluid rates. These complexities make detailed simulation unsuitable for RL applications.

Method: Developed an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent complex actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, enabling rapid processing in RL environments.

Result: Model outperforms neural network-based actuator models in data-limited scenarios. Locomotion policy trained with this model was successfully deployed on a 300+ kg hydraulic quadruped robot, achieving stable and robust command-tracking locomotion.

Conclusion: First successful demonstration of RL-based stable locomotion transfer to a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, showing advanced sim-to-real transferability through analytical hydraulic modeling.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

TL;DR: Adaptive wildfire front monitoring using mobile agents with integrated sensing, estimation, and control framework


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for wildfire monitoring treat sensing, estimation, and control separately, often with restrictive assumptions or heuristics lacking performance guarantees. The stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires seamless integration of these components.

Method: Formulate as stochastic optimal control problem, derive optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for nonlinear elliptical-growth fire models, transform to Markov decision process, and design information-seeking predictive control law using lower confidence bound adaptive search algorithm.

Result: Developed an integrated framework with asymptotic convergence to optimal policy, providing explicit performance guarantees unlike previous heuristic approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses limitations of existing methods by providing a principled, integrated solution for adaptive wildfire monitoring with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Conclusion: VLAgents provides an effective solution to simplify VLA deployment in robotics through unified interfaces and adaptive communication, outperforming existing policy servers and enabling more practical robotic applications.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation methods improve generalization by scaling data and networks but overlook skill-level information, missing the opportunity to leverage shared motion patterns across tasks within the same skill.

Method: SADiff uses skill-aware encoding with learnable skill tokens to capture skill-specific representations, conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow, and employs skill-retrieval transformation to refine 2D-to-3D action mapping.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that SADiff achieves strong performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks, validated by the new IsaacSkill dataset.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating skill-level information through SADiff effectively improves robotic manipulation generalization, with the IsaacSkill dataset providing comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous uncrewed vessel fleets is challenging due to differing decision-making processes, controllers between platforms, and limitations on real-time trajectory sharing. The need for safety across mixed autonomous and crewed vessels with potential uncooperative human behavior.

Method: Developed a distributed safety control filter using control barrier function (CBF) theory that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts. Applied to each autonomous vehicle, ensuring explainability. Compared worst-case CBF approach with COLREGS behavior-based approach in simulations and real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human-operated vessel.

Result: The approach proved effective across different platforms and robust to uncooperative human behavior. Results showed that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency in collision avoidance.

Conclusion: A pragmatic distributed safety control filter using worst-case CBF theory successfully addresses collision avoidance challenges in heterogeneous vessel fleets, with the combination of CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors providing optimal performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ACoT-VLA introduces Action Chain-of-Thought reasoning where explicit and implicit action reasoners generate structured coarse action sequences to guide precise robot manipulation policies, outperforming previous methods on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models use indirect intermediate reasoning (language sub-tasks or goal images) that lack granular information for precise action execution. The authors argue that reasoning should occur directly in the action space for better manipulation performance.

Method: Proposes ACoT-VLA with two components: Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) generates coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR) extracts latent action priors from multimodal inputs. Together they form Action Chain-of-Thought that conditions the downstream action head for grounded policy learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 98.5% on LIBERO, 84.1% on LIBERO-Plus, and 47.4% on VLABench, demonstrating superiority over existing methods in both real-world and simulation environments.

Conclusion: Action Chain-of-Thought paradigm, where reasoning occurs directly in action space through structured coarse action sequences, is more effective than indirect reasoning approaches for precise robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.

Motivation: Current robot learning datasets lack systematic design principles, making it unclear if they truly advance robotic capabilities or if evaluations on limited tasks accurately reflect method performance differences.

Method: Created 100 diverse tasks through systematic analysis and expansion of existing designs, incorporating human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. Collected trajectory data across multiple robotic platforms and evaluated baseline models.

Result: Tasks are both feasible to execute and sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate performance of current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

Conclusion: GM-100 serves as a foundational step toward a "robot learning Olympics," providing a comprehensive benchmark to promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs.

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

TL;DR: A semantic-geometric task graph representation for bimanual manipulation that captures both discrete semantic structure and temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations, enabling long-horizon task reasoning and robot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to understand structured task representations from human demonstrations for long-horizon bimanual manipulation, where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry vary significantly. Current methods struggle to jointly capture discrete semantic structure and temporal geometric evolution.

Method: Proposes semantic-geometric task graph representation encoding object identities, inter-object relations, and temporal geometric evolution. Uses MPNN encoder on temporal scene graphs for structured representations, and Transformer decoder conditioned on action-context to predict future action sequences, objects, and motions.

Result: Semantic-geometric task graphs outperform simpler sequence-based models, especially for tasks with high action/object variability. Representations can be transferred to physical bimanual robot for online action selection, demonstrating reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making.

Conclusion: The semantic-geometric task graph representation effectively captures both semantic structure and geometric evolution, enabling robust task progression reasoning and transfer to robotic systems for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DAGR-VQA introduces a novel NR-VQA framework using dynamic attention with global register tokens embedded directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal saliency prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-VQA methods using saliency or transformer attention only address global context superficially with static maps as auxiliary inputs, rather than fundamentally embedding context within feature extraction of video sequences.

Method: DAGR-VQA integrates learnable register tokens as global context carriers directly into a convolutional backbone, enabling dynamic HVS-inspired attention that produces temporally adaptive saliency maps without explicit motion estimation. The model combines dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, using spatial analysis followed by temporal transformer processing.

Result: Comprehensive testing on LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets shows highly competitive performance surpassing most top baselines. The model achieves 387.7 FPS at 1080p, demonstrating real-time computational efficiency suitable for multimedia streaming systems.

Conclusion: DAGR-VQA successfully integrates register tokens to create stable, temporally consistent attention mechanisms for NR-VQA, offering both superior performance and real-time efficiency for practical applications.

Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) estimates perceptual quality without a reference video, which is often challenging. While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.

Abstract: Interpretation of imaging findings based on morphological characteristics is important for diagnosing pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.

*Kaito Urata,Maiko Nagao,Atsushi Teramoto,Kazuyoshi Imaizumi,Masashi Kondo,Hiroshi Fujita*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed a method using latent diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) to generate chest CT nodule images from text prompts to address data imbalance in medical imaging for rare conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-aided diagnosis systems require large training datasets, but collecting sufficient CT images for rare conditions (like small cell carcinoma) or difficult-to-distinguish benign/malignant tumors is challenging due to data imbalance issues in clinical practice.

Method: Used LIDC-IDRI dataset to create pairs of nodule images and physician-evaluated text prompts. Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion v1.5 and v2.0 models on this dataset. Adjusted guidance scale (GS) parameter to control fidelity to input text during generation.

Result: SDv2 with GS=5 achieved best performance in quantitative and subjective evaluations for image quality, diversity, and text consistency. Generated images showed no statistically significant differences from real clinical images in subjective evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed LDM-based method can generate high-quality chest CT nodule images that successfully capture specific medical features, providing a solution to data imbalance problems in medical imaging for rare conditions.

Abstract: Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.

### [181] [Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching: A Novel GNSS Reflection-Based Framework for Enhanced Positioning Accuracy in Urban Areas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10727)
*Sanghyun Kim,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching (ZSRM) to improve urban GNSS positioning by combining shadow and reflection information, achieving 10-54% error reduction over shadow-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban GNSS positioning suffers from poor accuracy due to building reflections. Conventional shadow matching uses discrete grid points with limited resolution, making it hard to achieve robust positioning and meet safety requirements. Zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) uses set-based estimation but still has limitations in reducing position set size and precise location estimation.

Method: Proposes Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching (ZSRM) that enhances ZSM by incorporating reflection information in addition to shadow information. Uses set-based position estimation with zonotopes, distinguishing between LOS and NLOS satellites, and leverages both shadow areas (where LOS is blocked) and reflection information to better constrain receiver position.

Result: Field tests in urban environments show ZSRM improves RMS horizontal position error by 10.0% to 53.6% compared to ZSM. RMS cross-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1%, and along-street position bounds improved by 30.7% to 59.3%.

Conclusion: ZSRM significantly enhances urban GNSS positioning accuracy by combining shadow and reflection matching in a set-based framework, outperforming shadow-only methods and providing better position bounds for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: In urban areas, signal reception conditions are often poor due to reflections from buildings, resulting in inaccurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning. Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.

*Jakob Struye,Nabeel Nisar Bhat,Siddhartha Kumar,Mohammad Hossein Moghaddam,Jeroen Famaey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reduced sensing airtime affects gesture recognition performance in mmWave ISAC systems, finding that 25% sensing airtime only reduces accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most ISAC systems require dividing airtime between sensing and communications, but the specific impact of this division on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored, particularly for gesture recognition applications.

Method: The researchers collected a dataset of power per beam pair using two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures. They trained a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks, then subsampled these measurements to emulate reduced sensing airtime.

Result: The study shows that a sensing airtime of only 25% reduces classification accuracy by just 0.15 percentage points compared to full-time sensing, demonstrating that high-quality sensing can be maintained with minimal airtime allocation.

Conclusion: mmWave ISAC systems can provide both high-quality sensing (even with low airtime allocation) and extremely high data throughput, making them ideal enablers for applications like truly wireless Extended Reality that require both sensing and communication capabilities.

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Self-supervised noise reduction model for phonocardiography using Noise2Noise approach enables training without clean data, improving CHD diagnosis in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CHD affects 1% of births globally, and phonocardiography offers cost-effective diagnosis but requires noise reduction. Supervised UNet models need clean data which is limited, and balancing noise removal with pathological feature preservation is challenging due to complex time-frequency characteristics.

Method: Proposed self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise framework that doesn't require clean data for training. Used augmentation and contrastive learning to enhance performance.

Result: Achieved average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10 dB hospital noise. Classification sensitivity improved dramatically from 27% to 88%, demonstrating strong pathological feature retention in practical noisy environments.

Conclusion: The self-supervised Noise2Noise-based model effectively reduces noise in phonocardiography without requiring clean training data, significantly improving CHD classification sensitivity while preserving pathological features in real-world noisy hospital settings.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.

*Giuseppe Romano,Rodrigo Arrieta,Steven G. Johnson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SSP2 improves upon SSP by adding Hessian regularization to ensure twice-differentiability during topology changes while maintaining binary structures, enabling better convergence for connectivity-dominant problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturable structures in topology optimization are binary and non-differentiable, creating tension with gradient-based optimization. While SSP smooths interfaces at subpixel level, it doesn't guarantee differentiability during topology changes like interface merging, violating convergence guarantees of gradient-based algorithms.

Method: Proposes SSP2 (second-order SSP) that regularizes SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in twice-differentiable projected density during topology transitions while still guaranteeing almost-everywhere binary structure.

Result: SSP2 shows faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases where frequent topology changes occur, while maintaining comparable performance otherwise. It enables use of broader optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees like interior-point methods.

Conclusion: SSP2 overcomes SSP's limitation by ensuring differentiability during topology changes, improving convergence guarantees for gradient-based optimizers while adding minimal complexity, making it a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.

Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.

*Ayesh Abu Lehyeh,Anastassia Gharib,Tian Xia,Dryver Huston,Safwan Wshah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: UBiGTLoc: A unified BiLSTM-Graph Transformer framework for sensor node localization in IoT networks that works with or without anchor nodes, using only RSSI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization methods heavily depend on anchor nodes with GPS, which may not be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Localization accuracy is also compromised by RSSI fluctuations, especially under NLOS conditions.

Method: Proposes UBiGTLoc framework combining BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data with Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes.

Result: Extensive simulations show UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs using only cost-effective RSSI data.

Conclusion: UBiGTLoc offers an effective solution for sensor node localization that works in both anchor-free and anchor-presence scenarios, addressing practical limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India loses 30-40% of its 26 million tonnes annual onion production during storage. Traditional methods cause 40% spoilage, while effective cold storage is too expensive for small farmers who dominate Indian agriculture.

Method: IoT-based system with ESP32 microcontroller, DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor, MQ-135 gas sensor for spoilage detection, and UV-C disinfection technology. Automatically regulates environmental parameters, designed to be solar-powered and energy-efficient.

Result: System aims to reduce onion spoilage to 15-20% from current 40-45% wastage rate. Estimated cost of 60k-70k INR makes it affordable for small farmers.

Conclusion: Proposed smart storage system provides cost-effective, farmer-friendly solution to significantly reduce post-harvest losses in onion storage while remaining accessible to India's small and marginal farmers.

Abstract: India is the second largest producer of onions in the world, contributing over 26 million tonnes annually. However, during storage, approximately 30-40% of onions are lost due to rotting, sprouting, and weight loss. Despite being a major producer, conventional storage methods are either low-cost but ineffective (traditional storage with 40% spoilage) or highly effective but prohibitively expensive for small farmers (cold storage). This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based smart onion storage system that monitors and automatically regulates environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and spoilage gases using ESP32 microcontroller, DHT22 sensor, MQ-135 gas sensor, and UV-C disinfection technology. The proposed system aims to reduce onion spoilage to 15-20% from the current 40-45% wastage rate while remaining affordable for small and marginal farmers who constitute the majority in India. The system is designed to be cost-effective (estimated 60k-70k INR), energy-efficient, farmer-friendly, and solar-powered.

*Silke K. Kaiser*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Data-driven sensor placement strategies (spatial coverage + active learning) significantly improve traffic volume estimation accuracy, with temporary deployments matching permanent ones when using optimal temporal scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic sensor placement is often biased by administrative priorities rather than data-driven optimization, leading to poor coverage and reduced estimation performance for citywide traffic volumes.

Method: Large-scale benchmarking of spatial placement strategies (network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, active learning) and temporal deployment schemes using real-world data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts).

Result: Spatial strategies emphasizing even coverage and active learning reduce MAE by over 60% (Berlin) and 70% (Manhattan) with only 10 sensors. Temporal strategies (even weekday distribution) further reduce errors by 7% and 21% respectively.

Conclusion: Cities can substantially improve traffic data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, with temporary deployments achieving performance comparable to optimally placed permanent ones when using proper spatial and temporal principles.

Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.

*Junseok Lee,Jihye Shin,Sangyong Lee,Chang-Jae Chun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: LSR-Net: A lightweight robust network for real-time bearing fault diagnosis in noisy environments using denoising modules and efficient convolution blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bearings operate in harsh conditions (high speed, load, noise) making fault diagnosis challenging. Delayed diagnosis causes economic and safety risks. Existing methods struggle with noise interference and computational efficiency for real-time applications.

Method: Proposed LSR-Net with two key components: 1) Denoising and Feature Enhancement Module (DFEM) using convolution-based denoising blocks with adaptive pruning for strong noise, creating 3-channel 2D matrices; 2) Convolution-based Efficiency Shuffle (CES) blocks using group convolutions, channel splits, attention mechanisms, and channel shuffle for lightweight design while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The model achieved best anti-noise performance compared to benchmarks and had the lowest computational complexity when tested with vibration signals in noisy environments.

Conclusion: LSR-Net enables accurate real-time bearing fault diagnosis in noisy industrial environments with lightweight computational requirements, addressing both noise robustness and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Rotating bearings play an important role in modern industries, but have a high probability of occurrence of defects because they operate at high speed, high load, and poor operating environments. Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.

Conclusion: MOMPnet addresses both reliability and complexity challenges of traditional sparse recovery methods by combining deep unfolding with multiple small dictionaries, offering improved performance while preserving interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.

TL;DR: Using RIS to enhance radar detection of stealth targets by redirecting scattered energy back to radar, creating joint monostatic-bistatic configurations with improved detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multistatic radar networks for detecting low observable (stealth) targets face issues with synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption. There's a need for more efficient counter-stealth strategies.

Method: Propose using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to form joint monostatic and bistatic radar configurations. The RIS intercepts energy backscattered by targets along irrelevant directions and redirects it toward the radar. Five different detection architectures are designed that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes with constant false alarm rate properties. Also provides RIS design guidelines for practical implementation.

Result: Performance analysis shows the proposed RIS-assisted strategy leads to effective solutions for detecting low observable targets, outperforming conventional detectors.

Conclusion: RIS-assisted radar detection offers a promising alternative to multistatic radar networks for counter-stealth applications, addressing synchronization and cost issues while improving detection performance for low observable targets.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the radar detection of low observable targets with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Instead of using a multistatic radar network as counter-stealth strategy with its synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption issues, we exploit a RIS to form a joint monostatic and bistatic configuration that can intercept the energy backscattered by the target along irrelevant directions different from the line-of-sight of the radar. Then, this energy is redirected towards the radar that capitalizes all the backscattered energy to detect the low observable target. To this end, five different detection architectures are devised that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes and exhibit the constant false alarm rate property at least with respect to the clutter power. To support the practical implementation, we also provide a guideline for the design of a RIS that satisfies the operating requirements of the considered application. The performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detectors and shows that the proposed strategy leads to effective solutions to the detection of low observable targets.

*Xiang Cheng,Boxun Liu,Xuanyu Liu,Xuesong Cai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Large Wireless Foundation Models (LWFMs) as a solution to overcome limitations of task-specific AI models in 6G physical layer design, proposing two implementation paradigms and design principles under wireless constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based physical-layer designs use task-specific models with poor generalization, while communication systems need broad applicability. Foundation models offer strong reasoning but can't be directly transferred due to wireless constraints.

Method: Proposes two paradigms for LWFMs: 1) leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models, and 2) building novel wireless foundation models. Distills roadmaps for each paradigm with design principles under wireless constraints, supported by case studies.

Result: Introduces the LWFM framework, provides design principles for wireless-constrained foundation models, validates advantages through case studies, and characterizes what makes foundation models "large" in the wireless context.

Conclusion: LWFMs represent a promising direction for 6G AI-communication integration, overcoming limitations of task-specific models while addressing wireless constraints, with future research directions outlined.

Abstract: AI-communication integration is widely regarded as a core enabling technology for 6G. Most existing AI-based physical-layer designs rely on task-specific models that are separately tailored to individual modules, resulting in poor generalization. In contrast, communication systems are inherently general-purpose and should support broad applicability and robustness across diverse scenarios. Foundation models offer a promising solution through strong reasoning and generalization, yet wireless-system constraints hinder a direct transfer of large language model (LLM)-style success to the wireless domain. Therefore, we introduce the concept of large wireless foundation models (LWFMs) and present a novel framework for empowering the physical layer with foundation models under wireless constraints. Specifically, we propose two paradigms for realizing LWFMs, including leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models and building novel wireless foundation models. Based on recent progress, we distill two roadmaps for each paradigm and formulate design principles under wireless constraints. We further provide case studies of LWFM-empowered wireless systems to intuitively validate their advantages. Finally, we characterize the notion of "large" in LWFMs through a multidimensional analysis of existing work and outline promising directions for future research.

*Mengning Li,Wenye Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DuTrack is a fusion-based human tracking system that combines Wi-Fi and acoustic sensing to reduce accumulative errors in long-term tracking, achieving significant error reduction compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi tracking methods rely on velocity features but suffer from accumulative errors, making stable long-term trajectory tracking challenging. There's a need for more robust tracking systems for smart home and family care applications.

Method: DuTrack fuses Wi-Fi and acoustic sensing: models Wi-Fi sensing as elliptical Fresnel zones (LoS) and hyperbolic zones (NLoS), models acoustic sensing as hyperbolic clusters, establishes optimization equations for fusion, and designs a data-driven architecture to solve the optimization.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance with 89.37% reduction in median tracking error compared to model-based methods and 65.02% reduction compared to data-driven methods.

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion approach combining electromagnetic (Wi-Fi) and mechanical (acoustic) waves effectively rectifies accumulative errors in Wi-Fi tracking, enabling stable long-term human tracking for smart home applications.

Abstract: Wi-Fi tracking technology demonstrates promising potential for future smart home and intelligent family care. Currently, accurate Wi-Fi tracking methods rely primarily on fine-grained velocity features. However, such velocity-based approaches suffer from the problem of accumulative errors, making it challenging to stably track users' trajectories over a long period of time. This paper presents DuTrack, a fusion-based tracking system for stable human tracking. The fundamental idea is to leverage the ubiquitous acoustic signals in households to rectify the accumulative Wi-Fi tracking error. Theoretically, Wi-Fi sensing in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios can be modeled as elliptical Fresnel zones and hyperbolic zones, respectively. By designing acoustic sensing signals, we are able to model the acoustic sensing zones as a series of hyperbolic clusters. We reveal how to fuse the fields of electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves, and establish the optimization equation. Next, we design a data-driven architecture to solve the aforementioned optimization equation. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal tracking scheme exhibits superior performance. We achieve a 89.37% reduction in median tracking error compared to model-based methods and a 65.02% reduction compared to data-driven methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VFC relies on RF communications which limits adaptability in dense vehicular environments. There's a need for more efficient task offloading in next-generation transportation networks to support delay-sensitive services.

Method: Designed a heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture for VFC systems where computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links. Formulated an optimization problem to minimize average task processing delay and solved it using a residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm.

Result: The heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed RBMM algorithm achieves a 15% average task processing delay reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF communications.

Conclusion: The proposed heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture effectively combines the interference resilience of VLC with the coverage advantage of RF, providing a superior solution for task offloading in vehicular fog computing systems.

Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing technology enables non-intrusive, continuous monitoring of user locations and activities, which supports diverse smart home applications. Since different sensing tasks exhibit contextual relationships, their integration can enhance individual module performance.

The second is an extensible pipeline that can integrate sensing methodologies proposed in potential future research. This paper presents Uni-Fi, an extensible framework for multi-task Wi-Fi sensing integration. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose a unified theoretical framework that reveals the fundamental differences between single-task and multi-task sensing. Second, we develop a scalable sensing pipeline that automatically generates multi-task sensing solvers, enabling seamless integration of multiple sensing models.

*Marcus Henninger,Lucas Giroto,Ahmed Elkelesh,Silvio Mandelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Hybrid resource allocation scheme for bistatic ISAC that balances communication throughput and sensing performance by strategically placing lower modulation order symbols as pseudo-pilots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bistatic ISAC using cellular infrastructure is important for future sensing networks, but there's a conflict between communication needs (higher modulation order for throughput) and sensing needs (lower modulation order for better SNR in radar images).

Method: Introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme that places lower modulation order symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, enhancing bistatic sensing while only slightly reducing communication spectral efficiency.

Result: Simulation results validate the approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect sensing performance.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid scheme effectively addresses the resource allocation conflict in bistatic ISAC, enabling improved sensing performance with minimal impact on communication efficiency.

Abstract: Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.

*Qiaosen Zhang,Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes analog-domain LS and MMSE channel estimation for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems using specially designed training precoders/combiners, achieving digital-equivalent performance with reduced hardware/computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer hardware-efficient beamforming for massive MIMO, but channel estimation remains problematic since conventional digital methods (LS/MMSE) undermine MiLAC's benefits by requiring intensive computation.

Method: Design training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs to perform both LS and MMSE channel estimation fully in the analog domain, eliminating digital computation while maintaining identical performance to digital counterparts.

Result: Proposed analog-domain schemes achieve same performance as digital LS/MMSE while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, ADC/DAC resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

Conclusion: The proposed MiLAC-based analog channel estimation enables practical implementation of MiLAC-aided MIMO systems by preserving hardware/computational benefits while solving the critical channel estimation problem.

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.

*Yuki Nakamura,Shingo Takemoto,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CR-DMD is a novel robust DMD framework that addresses noise sensitivity through two-stage convex optimization for both mode extraction and dimensional reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DMD suffers from performance degradation under noise due to reliance on least-squares estimation. Existing robust variants remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) convex optimization-based preprocessing to remove mixed noise for accurate mode extraction, 2) new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links robustly extracted modes to original noisy observations via sparse weighted sum.

Result: CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions, demonstrated on fluid dynamics datasets.

Conclusion: CR-DMD provides a comprehensive robustification of the entire DMD process against mixed noise, offering stable mode extraction and faithful low-dimensional representations through efficient convex optimization solutions.

Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop scalable, broadband, and energy-efficient reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for mmWave applications (around 60 GHz) that overcome limitations of conventional approaches in bandwidth, phase control, and response time.

Method: Employed delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples phase shifting and radiating layers, using micrometer-thin liquid crystal (4.6 μm) for continuous phase control exceeding 360°. Implemented identical unit cells with column-wise biasing, fabricated two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements.

Result: Demonstrated beam steering over ±60°, -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures. Achieved nanowatt power consumption per unit cell. Measured aperture efficiencies of 9.2% and 2.6% (lower than simulated 20%+ due to lab challenges). Confirmed architecture scalability from 120 to 750 elements.

Conclusion: The DLA-based LC-RIS architecture shows superior potential over conventional approaches, enabling broadband operation, continuous phase control, fast response, low power consumption, and scalability to large arrays, though practical implementation faces efficiency challenges in laboratory environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband liquid crystal (LC) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating around 60 GHz and scaling up to 750 radiating elements. The RISs employ a delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples the phase shifting and radiating layer, enabling wide bandwidth, continuous phase control exceeding 360°, and fast response times with a micrometer-thin LC layer of 4.6 micrometer. Two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements are realized using identical unit cells and column-wise biasing. Measurements demonstrate beam steering over +-60° and -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures, confirming the scalability of the proposed architecture. On top of a measured nanowatt power consumption per unit cell, aperture efficiencies above 20% are predicted by simulations. While the measured efficiencies are reduced to 9.2% and 2.6%, a detailed analysis verifies that this reduction can be attributed to technological challenges in a laboratory environment. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between the applied DLA-based LC-RIS and a conventional approach highlights the superior potential of applied architecture.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analytical framework for microfluidic molecular communication receivers with finite receptor capacity, offering insights into channel behavior and practical detection strategies for such systems.

Abstract: This paper studies microfluidic molecular communication receivers with finite-capacity Langmuir adsorption driven by an effective surface concentration. In the reaction-limited regime, we derive a closed-form single-pulse response kernel and a symbol-rate recursion for on-off keying that explicitly exposes channel memory and inter-symbol interference. We further develop short-pulse and long-pulse approximations, revealing an interference asymmetry in the long-pulse regime due to saturation. To account for stochasticity, we adopt a finite-receptor binomial counting model, employ pulse-end sampling, and propose a low-complexity midpoint-threshold detector that reduces to a fixed threshold when interference is negligible. Numerical results corroborate the proposed characterization and quantify detection performance versus pulse and symbol durations.
