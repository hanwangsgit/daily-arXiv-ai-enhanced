*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-MDN is a probabilistic human trajectory forecasting model that combines high accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observation periods using few-shot denoising diffusion and dual mixture density networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior HTF work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, but neglected uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods - all crucial for downstream tasks like path planning and collision avoidance.

Method: Uses few-shot denoising diffusion backbone with dual mixture density network to learn self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, generating diverse trajectory hypotheses without predefined anchors or endpoints.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling demonstrated on ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets.

Conclusion: DD-MDN provides an effective end-to-end probabilistic HTF solution that addresses key limitations of prior work, offering calibrated uncertainty and robustness to short observations for practical applications.

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

*Yandan Yang,Shuang Zeng,Tong Lin,Xinyuan Chang,Dekang Qi,Junjin Xiao,Haoyun Liu,Ronghan Chen,Yuzhi Chen,Dongjie Huo,Feng Xiong,Xing Wei,Zhiheng Ma,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABot-M0 is a framework for building general-purpose embodied agents that transforms heterogeneous robot data into unified representations, uses Action Manifold Learning for efficient action prediction, and integrates modular perception with VLMs and 3D modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The "one-brain, many-forms" paradigm for embodied AI is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives across different robot hardware platforms.

Method: 1) Systematic data curation pipeline creating UniACT-dataset (6M+ trajectories); 2) Action Manifold Learning using DiT backbone to predict actions on low-dimensional manifolds; 3) Modular perception with dual-stream VLM semantics and geometric priors; 4) Plug-and-play 3D modules (VGGT, Qwen-Image-Edit).

Result: Created large-scale unified dataset, improved knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms/tasks, enhanced action prediction efficiency and stability, and achieved additive benefits from modular components.

Conclusion: ABot-M0 enables end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous robot data into unified representations, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence with improved efficiency, stability, and spatial understanding while maintaining modularity and reproducibility.

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

*Samanta Ghosh,Jannatul Adan Mahi,Shayan Abrar,Md Parvez Mia,Asaduzzaman Rayhan,Abdul Awal Yasir,Asaduzzaman Hridoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed deep learning models for automated tea leaf disease classification using the teaLeafBD dataset, achieving 93% accuracy with EfficientNetB3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tea is economically important for Bangladesh, but tea plants are vulnerable to leaf infections that reduce production quality and quantity. Manual disease detection is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Used teaLeafBD dataset with 5,278 high-resolution images across 7 categories (6 diseases + healthy). Pipeline included data preprocessing, splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, and model training with DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3. Applied Grad-CAM for explainable AI analysis.

Result: EfficientNetB3 achieved 93% classification accuracy, outperforming DenseNet201 (91%). Adversarial training improved model robustness against noisy inputs, and Grad-CAM provided interpretable visualizations of decision-making regions.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach effectively automates tea leaf disease detection, providing a practical solution for advanced agricultural management with high accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero is a framework that enables vision-language models to actively explore visual environments rather than passively interacting with static datasets, using three co-evolving agents to create self-scaffolding auto-curricula for more efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, leading to strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Models waste computational effort on samples that are either too trivial or too difficult for their current skill level.

Method: Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: 1) Searcher retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, 2) Questioner synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and 3) Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This creates a closed-loop system for self-scaffolding auto-curricula.

Result: On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

Conclusion: Active exploration is a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems, enabling models to autonomously construct their learning trajectories through active data acquisition tailored to their evolving capabilities.

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing is a multi-agent embodied performance art that uses AI-generated choreography from sci-fi texts to examine how AI systems encode socio-cultural biases through movement, creating a digital archive of human and robot motion traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement, and to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. The project confronts the question of what it means to be human among AIs that move, think, and leave traces.

Method: 1) Extract sentences describing human-machine interaction from science-fiction novels. 2) Use LLMs to generate paired prompts ("what to do" and "what not to do") for each excerpt. 3) Use diffusion-based text-to-video models to transform prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. 4) Both agents enact actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails.

Result: Creates a digital archive of motion traces through the interplay of AI, human, and robot. The performance art serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements.

Conclusion: ReTracing offers an archaeological approach to understanding AI's impact on bodily movement and serves as a critical exploration of human identity in an age where AIs also move, think, and leave traces behind.

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidLMs fail basic video understanding tasks that humans easily handle, prompting creation of REVEAL benchmark with 5 stress tests to diagnose fundamental weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Video-Language Models truly understand video content, temporal sequence, and motion, as current models may have fundamental weaknesses despite their apparent capabilities.

Method: Created REVEAL benchmark with 5 controlled stress tests: temporal expectation bias, language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and spatiotemporal occlusion robustness. Developed automated data pipeline for generating diagnostic examples.

Result: Leading VidLMs fail basic tasks - describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions ignoring video content, agree with false claims, struggle with camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information. Humans easily succeed at same tasks.

Conclusion: Current VidLMs lack robust video understanding capabilities, revealing fundamental weaknesses in temporal reasoning and content comprehension. REVEAL benchmark enables scalable evaluation to drive future research improvements.

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

### [7] [Advancing Digital Twin Generation Through a Novel Simulation Framework and Quantitative Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11314)
*Jacob Rubinstein,Avi Donaty,Don Engel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from 3D models to enable quantifiable testing of photogrammetry methods against ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current photogrammetry approaches for 3D model generation from real-world objects lack standardized quantitative evaluation methods, as differences between approaches are mostly judged qualitatively.

Method: Developed a pipeline that generates synthetic images from high-quality 3D models using programmatically generated camera poses, creating controlled, repeatable experiments with known ground-truth data.

Result: Enables systematic comparison of reconstructed camera parameters and object estimations against known ground-truth values, providing quantifiable metrics for evaluating photogrammetry performance.

Conclusion: The synthetic image generation pipeline offers a robust framework for repeatable, quantifiable testing of photogrammetry methods, moving beyond qualitative assessments to enable systematic evaluation of digital twin generation approaches.

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

### [8] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNC loss integrates ad-hoc and post-hoc selective prediction methods by incorporating softmax response uncertainty (selective prior) into SelectiveNet training, improving generalization and setting new SOTA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current selective prediction methods are either ad-hoc (modifying architecture/objective) or post-hoc (using probabilistic outputs at inference). The paper argues that the uncertainty information (selective prior) generated by post-hoc methods should also be utilized during training to improve selective prediction capabilities.

Method: Proposes SYNC loss that integrates ad-hoc (SelectiveNet) and post-hoc (softmax response) approaches. Specifically incorporates softmax response uncertainty information into SelectiveNet's training process, examining and utilizing the selective prior during training rather than just at inference.

Result: Evaluated on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. The method enhances model generalization capabilities, surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The selective prior (uncertainty information from post-hoc methods) is equally vital during training as during inference. Integrating ad-hoc and post-hoc approaches through SYNC loss significantly improves selective prediction performance and generalization.

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

*Arda Alniak,Sinan Kalkan,Mustafa Mert Ankarali,Afsar Saranli,Abdullah Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight VIO framework integrates dense depth priors from ViT models with optimization constraints for robust pose estimation in low-texture environments, achieving 28.3% ATE reduction while maintaining edge-device efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular VIO systems fail in low-texture environments due to insufficient visual features. While dense MDE from ViT models provides complementary geometric information, their computational complexity prevents real-time edge deployment.

Method: Integrates learned depth priors directly into VINS-Mono optimization backend with novel constraints: affine-invariant depth consistency, pairwise ordinal constraints, and variance-based gating to filter unstable artifacts while adhering to edge-device computational limits.

Result: Extensive experiments on TartanGround and M3ED datasets show the method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios, delivers significant accuracy gains, and reduces Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between computationally intensive ViT-based depth estimation and real-time edge deployment, enabling robust metric scale recovery in low-texture environments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Motivation: Existing real-time super-resolution methods struggle with compressed video content typical in streaming media, and current datasets don't accurately reflect real-world streaming characteristics, limiting the relevance of benchmarks.

Method: 1) Created StreamSR dataset from YouTube covering diverse video genres and resolutions representative of real streaming scenarios. 2) Proposed EfRLFN model integrating Efficient Channel Attention and hyperbolic tangent activation. 3) Used composite loss function for better training convergence. 4) Benchmarked 11 state-of-the-art real-time SR models.

Result: EfRLFN achieves improved visual quality and runtime performance compared to existing architectures. Fine-tuning other models on StreamSR dataset yields significant performance gains that generalize well across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The StreamSR dataset addresses the gap in streaming-focused SR evaluation, EfRLFN demonstrates superior efficiency for real-time streaming applications, and dataset-based fine-tuning provides substantial improvements for existing models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

TL;DR: Lightweight RGB-D fusion framework enhances EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors, achieving higher accuracy with only 11.2k training samples instead of massive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM models require massive datasets (11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants still depend on large-scale training. The paper aims to reduce data requirements while improving segmentation accuracy by incorporating depth information.

Method: Proposes a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated using a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder.

Result: Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1% of SA-1B), the method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, demonstrating that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

Conclusion: Depth information serves as a powerful geometric prior that can significantly reduce data requirements while improving segmentation performance, offering a more efficient alternative to large-scale RGB-only training.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

*Samuel Waugh,Stuart James*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtContext pipeline uses CLIP adaptation with LoRA to annotate artworks with information from art history articles, outperforming standard CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art history articles discuss artworks and specific aspects, but it's difficult to identify what different articles say about particular pieces when viewing them.

Method: Propose ArtContext pipeline that collects corpus from Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata, then adapts CLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to create domain-specific PaintingCLIP model.

Result: PaintingCLIP, weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for given artworks.

Conclusion: The pipeline is generalizable and can be applied to numerous humanities areas beyond art history.

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Forcing modifies diffusion architectures to process both latents and pixels with separate noise schedules, achieving latent diffusion efficiency while operating directly on raw images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models lose end-to-end modeling benefits by discarding information during encoding, requiring separate decoders, and modeling auxiliary distributions rather than raw data.

Method: Latent Forcing orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules, allowing latents to act as computational scratchpads before high-frequency pixel features are generated.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation on ImageNet at their compute scale, and provides insights into conditioning signal ordering, REPA distillation, and tokenizer reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Latent Forcing combines the efficiency of latent diffusion with the benefits of end-to-end modeling on raw images, offering a promising direction for diffusion model architectures.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using CTA data to train neural implicit functions for reconstructing cardiac shapes from anisotropic CMRI, improving resolution and anatomical plausibility for RV and myocardium reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The anisotropic nature of short-axis cardiovascular MRI limits cardiac shape analysis, creating a need for methods that can reconstruct higher resolution, anatomically plausible cardiac shapes from lower resolution data.

Method: Leverage near-isotropic, high-resolution CTA data to train a single neural implicit function that jointly represents cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution, focusing on reconstructing right ventricle and myocardium shapes.

Result: Achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.91±0.07 for RV and 0.75±0.13 for myocardium, with Hausdorff distances of 6.21±3.97mm and 7.53±5.13mm respectively, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of cardiac shapes.

Conclusion: The method successfully reconstructs accurate, smooth, and anatomically plausible cardiac shapes from anisotropic CMRI data, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis through neural implicit functions trained on high-resolution CTA data.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

TL;DR: Ctrl&Shift is a diffusion framework for geometry-consistent object manipulation in images/videos without explicit 3D reconstruction, achieving background preservation, geometric consistency, and user control through a two-stage removal-inpainting approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals for object manipulation: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly, while diffusion-based methods lack fine-grained geometric control.

Method: Decomposes manipulation into two stages: object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, encoded within a unified diffusion process. Uses multi-task, multi-stage training to separate background, identity, and pose signals. Introduces scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline with paired image/video samples and estimated relative camera poses.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. Achieves geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations.

Conclusion: First framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation without relying on explicit 3D modeling, addressing limitations of both geometry-based and diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel ULF DTI sequence with Bayesian bias correction and a CNN-based superresolution algorithm (DiffSR) to improve white matter imaging at ultra-low-field MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portable ultra-low-field MRI has potential for wider neuroimaging access but suffers from poor resolution and SNR, especially for diffusion tensor imaging which is crucial for white matter tract reconstruction.

Method: Developed a 9-direction single-shell ULF DTI sequence, Bayesian bias field correction with angular dependence, and a CNN-based superresolution algorithm (DiffSR) that generalizes across DTI datasets without retraining.

Result: The algorithms successfully recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF, improve DTI metric agreement in Alzheimer's disease classification, and show effectiveness in both synthetic and real matched scans.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance ULF reconstruction and DTI harmonization, with publicly released code to facilitate further research in portable neuroimaging.

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBTANet is a dual-branch framework for semantic change detection that combines SAM for global semantics/boundaries and ResNet34 for local details, with temporal modeling and boundary refinement modules to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic change detection methods suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy in detecting land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes DBTANet with: 1) Dual-branch Siamese encoder (frozen SAM for global context/boundaries + ResNet34 for local details), 2) Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) for multi-scale feature aggregation and temporal dependencies, 3) Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) to refine SAM features for boundary-aware constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, effectively integrating global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness.

Conclusion: DBTANet successfully addresses boundary blurring and temporal modeling limitations in semantic change detection, achieving superior performance through complementary feature representations and specialized modules for temporal and boundary refinement.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: ARFC is a flexible feature compression framework that supports any compression ratio with a single model using auto-regressive token prediction, enhanced by Mixture of Solutions and Entity Relation Graph Constraint modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature compression methods lack flexibility - they require dedicated models for specific compression ratios and need retraining for new ratios, limiting practical application efficiency.

Method: Proposes ARFC framework with Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (auto-regressive model for compression via next-token prediction), Mixture of Solutions module for refinement, and Entity Relation Graph Constraint to preserve semantic relationships.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks at various compression ratios; sometimes even surpasses uncompressed feature performance.

Conclusion: ARFC provides an effective and versatile solution for resource-constrained scenarios, enabling flexible compression ratio control with a single model while maintaining or improving feature quality.

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs have limitations in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction reasoning due to cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity, requiring more robust visual understanding approaches.

Method: Constructs cognitive maps modeling relationships between detected entities and candidate actions, then dynamically invokes tools (retrieval augmentation, image cropping, diffusion models) for domain knowledge and visual evidence. Uses composite reward balancing accuracy and tool efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets while requiring only ~20% of training data compared to existing methods, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ImagineAgent successfully addresses cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion ambiguity through cognitive reasoning with generative imagination, enabling more reliable OV-HOI understanding with significantly reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

TL;DR: VasoMIM is a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling framework for self-supervised learning on X-ray angiograms, combined with the XA-170K dataset, achieving SOTA performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for X-ray angiogram analysis is limited by scarce annotated data. While SSL shows promise, effective frameworks and large-scale datasets for this domain are lacking.

Method: VasoMIM integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge through: 1) anatomy-guided masking strategy that masks vessel-containing patches, and 2) anatomical consistency loss that preserves vessel structural consistency between original and reconstructed images.

Result: Validated on four downstream tasks across six datasets, VasoMIM demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VasoMIM shows significant potential as a foundation model for advancing X-ray angiogram analysis tasks, with both framework and XA-170K dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

TL;DR: MFdiff: A supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model that uses MR images to restore high-quality standard-dose PET from low-dose PET, addressing structure-texture inconsistencies and OOD data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging involves radiation exposure, and reducing dose/scan time degrades image quality. Using MR images to restore standard-dose PET is promising but faces challenges with multi-modality fusion inconsistencies and OOD data mismatches.

Method: 1) Multi-modality feature fusion module to learn optimized fusion features from MR without introducing extraneous details. 2) Diffusion model using fusion features as condition to iteratively generate SPET. 3) Two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy leveraging both simulated in-distribution priors and specific in-vivo OOD priors.

Result: MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed MFdiff successfully addresses multi-modality fusion challenges and OOD data issues for high-quality PET restoration, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: Proposes generative compression framework for perception-based denoising using entropy-coded latent representations and generative decoders with perceptual losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion-driven denoising methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift, lacking perceptual realism.

Method: Two approaches: (1) conditional WGAN-based compression denoiser with explicit RDP trade-off control, (2) conditional diffusion-based reconstruction with iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. Uses entropy-coded latent representations and generative decoders with LPIPS loss and Wasserstein distance.

Result: Establishes non-asymptotic guarantees for compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under Gaussian noise. Experiments show consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks.

Conclusion: Generative compression framework effectively addresses perception-distortion trade-off in denoising, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements in perceptual quality.

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with ultra-high-resolution video generation due to compounded difficulties in motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. Existing approaches face challenges in maintaining motion consistency while generating high-resolution content with fine details.

Method: LUVE employs a three-stage architecture: 1) low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, 2) video latent upsampling in latent space to reduce memory/computational overhead, and 3) high-resolution content refinement using dual frequency experts (low-frequency for semantic coherence and high-frequency for fine-grained details).

Result: Extensive experiments show LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in ultra-high-resolution video generation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the framework.

Conclusion: LUVE successfully addresses the challenges of ultra-high-resolution video generation through its latent-cascaded architecture with dual frequency experts, providing an effective solution for high-quality video synthesis with improved motion consistency and detail generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality, yet ultra-high-resolution (UHR) video generation remains a formidable challenge due to the compounded difficulties of motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{LUVE}, a \textbf{L}atent-cascaded \textbf{U}HR \textbf{V}ideo generation framework built upon dual frequency \textbf{E}xperts. LUVE employs a three-stage architecture comprising low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, video latent upsampling that performs resolution upsampling directly in the latent space to mitigate memory and computational overhead, and high-resolution content refinement that integrates low-frequency and high-frequency experts to jointly enhance semantic coherence and fine-grained detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: FlowAdapt: A parameter-efficient domain adaptation framework for V2X collaborative perception using optimal transport theory to address inter-frame redundancy and semantic erosion with only 1% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast domain adaptation is crucial for deploying multi-agent systems in diverse V2X environments. Existing PEFT methods from NLP and vision fail in multi-agent settings due to performance degradation and training instability caused by inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams and erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations.

Method: FlowAdapt uses optimal transport theory to minimize information transport costs across data distributions and network hierarchies. It introduces: 1) Wasserstein Greedy Sampling to filter redundant samples via bounded covering radius, and 2) Progressive Knowledge Transfer module to inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways to prevent semantic degradation.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt successfully addresses the limitations of PEFT in multi-agent V2X perception by tackling inter-frame redundancy and semantic erosion through optimal transport-based approaches, enabling efficient domain adaptation with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI-aided vision-based SHM only produces discrete outputs (damage labels, coordinates) requiring manual reorganization by engineers. The rise of LLMs in 2022 provides opportunity to automate comprehensive report generation for post-disaster assessment.

Method: LLM-DRS framework with standard reconnaissance plan for collecting vision data and metadata. Deep CNNs extract key attributes (damage state, material type, damage level) from images. LLM with carefully designed prompts processes integrated data to generate summary reports for structures or regions.

Result: Integration of LLMs into vision-based SHM shows promising potential for improving resilience through effective reconnaissance, particularly for rapid post-disaster assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-DRS framework successfully demonstrates how LLMs can enhance vision-based structural health monitoring by automating comprehensive report generation from visual data and metadata, moving beyond discrete outputs to actionable summaries.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT reconstruction faces severe noise and data fidelity issues under reduced radiation. Existing methods in image or post-log domains fail to exploit pre-log structural information while being highly susceptible to noise amplification from logarithmic transformation.

Method: Proposes PLOT-CT framework using Voronoi decomposition on pre-log sinograms to disentangle data into distinct underlying components embedded in separate latent spaces, enhancing discriminative feature learning and reconstruction accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at 1e4 incident photon level in pre-log domain, effectively mitigating noise while preserving pre-log information.

Conclusion: PLOT-CT successfully overcomes challenges in low-dose CT reconstruction by leveraging pre-log domain information through Voronoi decomposition, demonstrating superior reconstruction accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLESS: A generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that improves reliability and spatial consistency through hierarchical region partitioning and scribble propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations reduce labeling costs but suffer from noisy/incomplete supervision. Existing pseudo-label methods in medical image segmentation are limited by poor pseudo-label quality, which restricts segmentation accuracy.

Method: PLESS uses hierarchical partitioning of images into spatially coherent regions, then propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and integrates into existing pseudo-label methods.

Result: Experiments on two cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: PLESS effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in scribble-supervised medical image segmentation, improving segmentation performance while maintaining model-agnostic flexibility.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Method: ScalSelect extracts visual features most attended by instruction tokens to create sample representations, then identifies samples that best approximate the dominant subspace of full dataset representations, enabling linear-time importance scoring without pairwise comparisons.

Result: Achieves over 97.5% performance of full dataset training using only 16% of data, outperforms full-data training in some settings, and works across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets.

Conclusion: ScalSelect provides an efficient, scalable, training-free solution for multimodal data selection that eliminates need for external models/auxiliary datasets while maintaining high performance with minimal data.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

*Diego Patiño,Knut Peterson,Kostas Daniilidis,David K. Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel surface reconstruction method using Poisson's equation as proxy PDE instead of Eikonal equation, leveraging Green's functions and superposition for better high-frequency detail approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use SDFs and Eikonal PDE for surface reconstruction, but the authors propose using Poisson's equation as a proxy PDE to better capture high-frequency details with fewer shape priors.

Method: Encode surface reconstruction as solution to Poisson's equation, connect to physics (electrostatic potential), use Green's functions for closed-form parametric solution, and leverage linearity for superposition of solutions.

Result: Improved approximation of high-frequency details even with small number of shape priors compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Poisson's equation provides an effective alternative to Eikonal PDE for surface reconstruction, offering better detail capture through Green's functions and superposition principles.

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

*Ryan Deem,Garrett Goodman,Waqas Majeed,Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan,Michail S. Alexiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain tumor classification models (BrainNet, BrainNeXt, DilationNet) show varying adversarial robustness to FGSM/PGD attacks on MRI data, with BrainNeXt most robust but producing weaker transferable samples, revealing resolution-robustness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness in brain tumor classification models is underexplored but critical for clinical deployment of MRI-based deep learning systems, especially given the safety requirements in medical applications.

Method: Evaluated three ResNet-based architectures (BrainNet, BrainNeXt, DilationNet) against gradient-based adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD) across three preprocessing configurations: full-sized augmented, shrunk augmented, and shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets.

Result: BrainNeXt models showed highest robustness to black-box attacks (likely due to increased cardinality) but produced weaker transferable adversarial samples. BrainNet and Dilation models were more vulnerable to cross-architecture attacks, especially under PGD with higher iterations. Shrunk non-augmented data significantly reduced model resilience despite maintaining high untampered accuracy.

Conclusion: Joint evaluation of classification performance and adversarial robustness is essential for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis, revealing important trade-offs between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GR-Diffusion: A novel framework combining 3D discrete Gaussian representation with diffusion models for improved low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET reconstruction faces challenges with noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and ill-posed inverse problems. Existing methods have low-pass limitations, and there's a need for better preservation of physiological details in low-dose scenarios.

Method: GR-Diffusion integrates 3D discrete Gaussian representation (GR) with diffusion models. GR generates a reference 3D PET image from projection data, providing a physically grounded benchmark. This reference guides the diffusion process through hierarchical guidance: fine-grained guidance refines local details using differences, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations.

Result: Experimental results on UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: The synergistic integration of geometric priors from GR with generative power of diffusion models enables superior PET reconstruction, overcoming limitations of conventional methods and effectively recovering sub-voxel information.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

*Seo Hyun Kim,Jin Bok Park,Do Yeon Koo,Ho Gun Park,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SToRM is a Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs in autonomous driving that reduces computational costs by 30x while maintaining performance comparable to using all visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end driving systems using MLLMs for human-vehicle interaction require substantial computational resources due to LLM processing and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Existing token reduction methods often suffer performance degradation.

Method: SToRM framework with three key elements: 1) lightweight importance predictor with sliding windows to estimate token importance scores, 2) supervised training using auxiliary path for pseudo-supervision from all-token LLM pass, 3) anchor-context merging module that partitions tokens into anchors/context and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy.

Result: Experiments on LangAuto benchmark show SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Conclusion: SToRM enables efficient end-to-end driving with MLLMs while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, addressing computational limitations in autonomous vehicles through supervised token reduction.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences.

We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clutt3R-Seg is a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation in cluttered scenes that uses hierarchical instance trees of semantic cues to handle noisy masks and occlusions, enabling accurate language-grounded grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is crucial for language-grounded robotic manipulation in cluttered environments where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception performance.

Method: Introduces hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues that leverages noisy masks as informative cues through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution. Uses open-vocabulary semantic embeddings for language understanding and consistency-aware updates for handling scene changes during multi-stage tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Achieves AP@25 of 61.66 on heavy-clutter sequences (2.2x higher than baselines). With only four input views, surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Conclusion: Clutt3R-Seg provides robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes, handling noisy masks and occlusions effectively while enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions.

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior egocentric gaze estimation work focuses mainly on head-mounted cameras, leaving alternative viewpoints like neck-mounted cameras underexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing and studying neck-mounted view gaze estimation.

Method: 1) Collected first dataset with ~4 hours of video from 8 participants during everyday activities. 2) Evaluated transformer-based gaze estimation model (GLC) on new dataset. 3) Proposed two extensions: auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and multi-view co-learning approach using geometry-aware auxiliary loss to jointly train head-view and neck-view models.

Result: Incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improved performance over standard fine-tuning, while the multi-view co-learning approach did not yield performance gains. The paper provides analysis and implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: Neck-mounted view gaze estimation is a viable task with practical applications. Gaze out-of-bound classification is beneficial for this task, but multi-view co-learning needs further investigation. The collected dataset enables future research in this underexplored area.

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: TD-FusionUNet effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in lightweight setting, making it suitable for real-time wildfire prediction in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba effectively addresses rotation invariance in 3D shape retrieval, enabling practical applications with diverse object categories and arbitrary orientations through efficient linear-time processing.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSA is crucial for cerebrovascular disease but invasive and expensive, limiting data collection and sharing. Synthetic DSA generation could enable algorithm development, research, and training.

Method: Developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) trained on 99,349 DSA frames. Used text embeddings to control anatomical circulation (anterior/posterior) and C-arm positions. Validated with 4 medical experts rating 400 synthetic images on a 5-point Likert scale.

Result: Synthetic images achieved Likert scores of 3.1-3.3 with high inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.80-0.87). Low median FID of 15.27 indicates distributional similarity to real DSAs.

Conclusion: Semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream applications in algorithm development, research, and medical training.

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting adaptations for CT struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions, requiring a more robust solution for clinical applications.

Method: Uses multi-resolution hash encoder for spatial priors, time-conditioned representations with spatiotemporal attention for dynamic cases, and motion-flow network for respiratory motion tracking.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Conclusion: TG-Field provides an effective geometry-aware framework for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction that handles sparse-view artifacts and temporal coherence challenges.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based 3D scene generation lacks domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design, leading to poor control and scalability.

Method: Developed modular multi-LLM pipeline with 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and Unreal Engine code generation using hybrid optimization techniques (few-shot prompting, RAG, finetuning, validation).

Result: System creates realistic agricultural environments from prompts; user study confirms realism and familiarity; expert comparison shows significant time savings over manual design.

Conclusion: Multi-LLM pipelines effectively automate domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision; future work includes expanding asset hierarchy and adapting to other domains.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Motivation: Existing methods either couple tracking and mapping with unified scenes (computationally expensive) or loosely integrate them with structured tracking frameworks (introducing redundancies). Need for efficient real-time dense SLAM with high fidelity.

Method: Bidirectional coupling of Visual Odometry and Gaussian Splatting using Expectation-Maximization framework for joint optimization. Introduces Gaussian Splat Initialization using VO data to create close approximations without heuristics.

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM effectively integrates VO and Gaussian Splatting through EM optimization, enabling real-time dense SLAM with superior reconstruction quality and tracking performance.

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

*Xiaowen Zhang,Zhi Gao,Licheng Jiao,Lingling Li,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual prompting paradigm for spatial-temporal video grounding that reformulates coordinate prediction as instance-level identification with unique object IDs, combined with a reinforcement learning framework (STVG-R1) that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from hallucinations due to misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates, especially in dense prediction tasks like spatial-temporal video grounding. Existing approaches that enhance visual-textual alignment or add auxiliary decoders introduce additional trainable modules, leading to high annotation costs and computational overhead.

Method: Proposes a visual prompting paradigm that avoids coordinate alignment by reformulating per-frame coordinate prediction as instance-level identification with unique, temporally consistent object IDs embedded as visual prompts. Introduces STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, using task-driven rewards to optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization.

Result: STVG-R1 surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.9% on m_IoU on HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art. Also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation, achieving SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS benchmark.

Conclusion: The visual prompting paradigm with instance-level identification and reinforcement learning framework effectively addresses hallucination issues in VLMs for spatial-temporal video grounding, achieving superior performance while avoiding the computational overhead of traditional alignment approaches.

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce requires strong multimodal comprehension (text, images, attributes) but general VLMs aren't optimized for e-commerce's attribute-centric, multi-image, noisy data without sacrificing general performance.

Method: Targeted adaptation of general VLMs through large-scale experimental study, plus proposing a novel evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Result: Targeted adaptation substantially improves e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: Adapting general VLMs with targeted fine-tuning is effective for e-commerce applications, and the proposed evaluation suite provides comprehensive assessment of multimodal capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) where models generate objects not present in visual inputs, improving reliability of visual-language understanding.

Method: Enhances VCD by constructing object-aligned auxiliary views using object-centric attention from self-supervised Vision Transformers. Removes most salient visual evidence to create disruptive auxiliary views that produce stronger contrast signals against unsupported tokens.

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass.

*Xiangyu Wu,Dongming Jiang,Feng Yu,Yueying Tian,Jiaqi Tang,Qing-Guo Chen,Yang Yang,Jianfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADTE introduces Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy to address CLIP's pretraining bias in Test-Time Adaptation, outperforming Shannon Entropy-based methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models have built-in bias from pretraining on imbalanced web data, causing Shannon Entropy to produce biased uncertainty estimates during Test-Time Adaptation. This bias leads to suboptimal adaptation performance.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE), which generalizes Tsallis Entropy with class-specific parameter q^l derived from estimated label bias of incoming test instances. This enables accurate high-confidence view selection and integrates with label adjustment strategies without hyperparameter tuning.

Result: ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of model architecture or text prompts.

Conclusion: Tsallis Entropy and its adaptive variant ADTE provide superior alternatives to Shannon Entropy for TTA, effectively addressing CLIP's pretraining bias and improving adaptation performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code2Worlds: A framework for 4D world generation via language-to-simulation code that addresses multi-scale context and semantic-physical gaps using dual-stream architecture and physics-aware closed-loop refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus on static 3D scene generation but fail at 4D dynamics. Two key challenges: 1) multi-scale context entanglement (balancing local objects with global layouts), and 2) semantic-physical execution gap (open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity).

Method: 1) Dual-stream architecture disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. 2) Physics-aware closed-loop mechanism with PostProcess Agent scripting dynamics and VLM-Motion Critic performing self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code.

Result: Outperforms baselines on Code4D benchmark with 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness. Uniquely generates physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds successfully bridges the gap between language instructions and physics-grounded 4D world simulation through code generation, addressing both structural and dynamic fidelity challenges in world building.

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

TL;DR: JEPA-VLA improves vision-language-action models by integrating predictive video embeddings (V-JEPA 2) to address limitations in environment understanding and policy priors, achieving better performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization due to inadequate pretrained visual representations that fail to capture task-relevant environment information and effective policy priors.

Method: The paper introduces JEPA-VLA, which adaptively integrates predictive embeddings from video-pretrained models (specifically V-JEPA 2) into existing VLAs. These predictive embeddings excel at discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics.

Result: JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: Predictive video embeddings effectively compensate for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs, and their adaptive integration through JEPA-VLA provides a simple yet effective approach to enhance robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90 degrees.

Conclusion: Light4D successfully addresses 4D relighting challenges without requiring training, enabling consistent video synthesis under target illumination with extreme viewpoint changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D fractals generated via Iterated Function Systems are used as synthetic video data for pre-training action recognition models, with a new Targeted Smart Filtering method improving generation speed 100x and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets like Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL) offer advantages over real data: infinite perfectly labeled data, no manual labeling labor, and no privacy/ethical concerns. However, existing 3D fractal generation methods are slow and produce degenerate fractals that hurt downstream task performance.

Method: Generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS), temporally transform them into videos for pre-training. Propose Targeted Smart Filtering method to address slow generation speed and lack of fractal diversity. The method filters fractals more efficiently while maintaining diversity beneficial for downstream tasks.

Result: Targeted Smart Filtering achieves roughly 100 times faster sampling speed compared to standard methods. It also achieves superior downstream performance in action recognition tasks compared to other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Targeted Smart Filtering method effectively addresses both generation speed and fractal diversity issues in 3D fractal generation for synthetic video pre-training, leading to significant speed improvements and better downstream action recognition performance.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Motivation: Existing RF-based inversion methods suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction/editing quality.

Method: Proposes PMI: training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes velocity field by guiding it toward running average of past velocities within theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Also introduces mimic-CFG: lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks that interpolates between current velocity and its projection onto historical average.

Result: Significantly improves inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity while reducing required neural function evaluations. Achieves SOTA performance on PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: PMI and mimic-CFG provide effective solutions to RF inversion instability, enabling better reconstruction and editing with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception where small evidence is overwhelmed by global context. Existing "Thinking-with-Images" methods that iteratively zoom incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding.

Method: Region-to-Image Distillation: 1) Zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, 2) Distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. Also introduces ZoomBench benchmark with 845 VQA data across six fine-grained perceptual dimensions.

Result: Models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, improve general multimodal cognition on visual reasoning and GUI agents benchmarks, and discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary vs. when gains can be distilled.

Conclusion: Region-to-Image Distillation successfully transforms zooming from inference-time tool to training-time primitive, enabling MLLMs to perform fine-grained perception in a single forward pass without tool use, while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel ring artifact reduction method using an unrolled network that leverages intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains, trained on synthetic data to avoid costly real clinical data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ring artifacts in CT images from defective detectors make images unusable for clinical purposes. Existing deep learning methods require expensive real clinical datasets and focus on either image or sinogram domain separately, ignoring CT geometry correlations.

Method: Reformulates ring artifact reduction as an inverse problem using an unrolled network that considers non-ideal detector responses with linear forward-projection of CT geometry. Uses synthetic data from natural images to leverage intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains.

Result: The model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions, demonstrating effective ring artifact correction without requiring real clinical data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses ring artifact reduction by leveraging CT geometry correlations through an unrolled network and synthetic data training, eliminating the need for costly real clinical datasets while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Built on DynaHOI-Gym, we release DynaHOI-10M, a large-scale benchmark with 10M frames and 180K hand capture trajectories, whose target motions are organized into 8 major categories and 22 fine-grained subcategories. We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.

TL;DR: A novel framework using implicit neural representations and diffusion models to synthesize LGE cardiac MRI images with corresponding segmentation masks, addressing data scarcity for automated fibrosis segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated datasets for LGE imaging hinder development of automated myocardial scar segmentation methods, creating a need for annotation-free approaches to mitigate data scarcity.

Method: Combines implicit neural representations (INRs) with denoising diffusion models: first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and masks, compresses them into latent embeddings, then uses diffusion models to generate new representations that decode into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks.

Result: Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans show that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes improves fibrosis segmentation performance, with Dice score increasing from 0.509 to 0.524.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective annotation-free method to address data scarcity in LGE imaging, enabling improved automated fibrosis segmentation through synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

*Bruno Rigal,Victor Dupriez,Alexis Mignon,Ronan Le Hy,Nicolas Mery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a French-focused benchmark for evaluating PDF-to-Markdown conversion using Vision-Language Models, addressing limitations in existing English/Chinese benchmarks and focusing on challenging document types like handwritten forms and complex layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for document parsing often focus on English or Chinese and penalize benign formatting differences that don't affect downstream RAG pipeline performance. There's a need for better evaluation of PDF-to-Markdown conversion, especially for challenging French documents where transcription and layout errors can propagate to retrieval and grounding tasks.

Method: The authors create a French-focused benchmark using model-disagreement sampling from 60,000 documents, selecting difficult pages covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation uses unit-test-style checks targeting concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, local table constraints) with category-specific normalization to discount presentation-only variance.

Result: Across 15 models, the strongest proprietary models show substantially higher robustness on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the importance of targeted evaluation for document parsing in RAG pipelines, showing performance differences between proprietary and open-weight models across different document types, with proprietary models excelling at challenging handwritten content while open models perform well on standard layouts.

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian deep learning framework with novel CUB-Loss and Dual Temperature Scaling improves uncertainty calibration in medical AI, making predictions more reliable for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models in medical imaging often suffer from miscalibration (overconfidence in wrong predictions), which undermines clinical trust. Clinicians need reliable uncertainty estimates to identify when to review AI outputs.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic optimization framework with: 1) Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) that penalizes high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions during training, and 2) Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) for post-hoc calibration refinement.

Result: Validated on pneumonia screening, diabetic retinopathy detection, and skin lesion identification. Achieves consistent calibration improvements across modalities, robust performance with scarce data, and effectiveness on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully aligns uncertainty estimates with prediction correctness, enhancing reliability for clinical deployment by allowing clinicians to identify unreliable AI outputs for review.

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

TL;DR: SCoT framework bridges MLLM spatial reasoning with diffusion models using plug-and-play layout planning, achieving SOTA performance without joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with complex spatial understanding/reasoning. Existing MLLM approaches either have high computational costs from joint training or suffer spatial information loss from text-only prompts.

Method: Propose Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT): 1) Train diffusion model on interleaved text-coordinate instruction format for layout awareness, 2) Use MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring spatial planning to generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks, significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, and shows strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Conclusion: SCoT effectively bridges MLLM reasoning capabilities with diffusion model generation through plug-and-play layout planning, solving spatial understanding limitations without costly joint training.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned local vision-language models with LoRA achieve F1=0.91 for newborn resuscitation activity recognition, outperforming TimeSFormer (F1=0.70) and addressing hallucination issues in zero-shot VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is crucial for quality improvement and guideline adherence, but current methods using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers face challenges in recognizing fine-grained activities from videos.

Method: Explored generative AI methods using local vision-language models combined with LLMs, evaluated zero-shot VLM strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads including LoRA on 13.26 hours of simulated newborn resuscitation videos.

Result: Small local VLMs initially struggled with hallucinations, but fine-tuning with LoRA achieved F1 score of 0.91, significantly surpassing the TimeSFormer baseline of 0.70.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned local VLMs with LoRA adaptation show strong potential for improving activity recognition in newborn resuscitation videos, outperforming traditional supervised methods and addressing limitations of zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

Conclusion: World model-based reinforcement learning (RAMP) effectively enhances VLA models, enabling robust cross-task adaptation and reliable execution of complex manipulation tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterOmni is a unified framework for image-to-poster generation that combines local editing (preserving visual entities) and global creation (understanding design concepts) through a data-distillation-reward pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-to-poster generation requires both local adjustments (preserving specific visual elements) and high-level design understanding (layout, style, concepts). Current approaches struggle with balancing these intertwined demands of entity-preserving editing and concept-driven creation under image-prompt control.

Method: PosterOmni uses a three-step pipeline: (1) constructs multi-scenario datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (2) distills knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; (3) applies unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preferences across all tasks.

Result: PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems. The authors also establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation.

Conclusion: PosterOmni successfully addresses the multi-dimensional challenges of image-to-poster generation by integrating local editing and global creation within a single system, demonstrating superior performance through its data-distillation-reward approach and establishing a comprehensive evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

TL;DR: FAIL proposes adversarial imitation learning for flow matching models, offering two algorithms (FAIL-PD and FAIL-PG) that fine-tune models without explicit rewards or preference pairs, achieving competitive performance with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods for flow matching models have limitations: Supervised Fine-Tuning suffers from policy drift in unseen states, while preference optimization methods require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. There's a need for a more efficient approach that can align model outputs with high-quality targets without these drawbacks.

Method: FAIL (Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning) minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons.

Result: Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. The framework also generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

Conclusion: FAIL provides an effective adversarial imitation learning framework for flow matching models that addresses limitations of existing methods, requiring minimal demonstrations while achieving competitive performance and offering generalization to various generation tasks.

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling.

TL;DR: TexSpot introduces a novel 3D texture representation called Texlet that combines point-based geometric expressiveness with UV-based compactness, enabling high-quality texture enhancement through diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation methods suffer from view-inconsistency in multi-view diffusion pipelines. UV maps have distortion issues during unwrapping, while point-based methods tie texture fidelity to geometric density, limiting high-resolution generation.

Method: TexSpot uses Texlet representation where each latent vector encodes a local texture patch via 2D encoder, aggregated with 3D encoder for global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs texture patches. A diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets refines textures from multi-view diffusion methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Conclusion: TexSpot addresses fundamental limitations in 3D texture generation by introducing a novel representation that combines the best of point-based and UV-based approaches, enabling high-quality texture enhancement through diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Motivation: Existing approaches treat human-centric audio-video tasks as isolated objectives and struggle with precise disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres in multi-person scenarios.

Method: Uses Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer with symmetric conditional injection, Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy (Synchronized RoPE for signal-level binding and Structured Captions for semantic-level mapping), and Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency metrics, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni provides a unified solution for controllable human-centric audio-video generation with strong disentanglement capabilities and will be released to bridge academic-commercial gap.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

Result: Experiments on the TerraMesh dataset show that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

Conclusion: EO-VAE provides an effective foundational tokenizer for the Earth observation domain, enabling more efficient latent generative modeling by handling diverse sensor data with a single model rather than requiring separate tokenizers for each modality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

TL;DR: DeepGen 1.0 is a lightweight 5B unified multimodal model for image generation and editing that achieves state-of-the-art performance despite being much smaller than competitors (80B+ models).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models for image generation/editing require massive parameter scales (>10B), leading to prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. There's a need for more efficient, lightweight alternatives that maintain high performance.

Method: 1) Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB): deep alignment framework extracting hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fusing them with learnable 'think tokens' for structured guidance. 2) Three-stage training: Alignment Pre-training on image-text pairs/editing triplets, Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on generation/editing/reasoning tasks, and Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO using mixture of reward functions.

Result: Despite training on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance: surpasses 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE benchmark and 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. The 5B model competes with or surpasses much larger counterparts.

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0 provides an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research, offering competitive capabilities with significantly reduced parameter scale and training costs while being open-sourced.

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monarch-RT: A structured attention parameterization using Monarch matrices for real-time video diffusion models, achieving 95% sparsity without quality loss and enabling 16 FPS real-time generation on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers suffers from quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in few-step autoregressive settings where errors compound. Existing sparse-attention approximations fail in this regime despite working well for bidirectional, many-step diffusion.

Method: Proposes Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices with aligned block structure and extended tiled Monarch parameterization. Uses custom Triton kernels and finetuning to overcome parameterization overhead.

Result: Achieves 95% attention sparsity with no quality loss when applied to state-of-the-art Self-Forcing model. Outperforms FlashAttention-2/3/4 kernels on various GPUs with 1.4-11.8X speedups. Enables true real-time video generation at 16 FPS on single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: Monarch-RT is a pioneering sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation that successfully addresses the limitations of existing sparse approximations in few-step autoregressive settings, achieving both computational efficiency and high expressivity.

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniT is a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables unified models to reason, verify, and refine outputs iteratively across multiple rounds, improving both generation and understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models operate in single-pass without iterative refinement, but many complex multimodal tasks require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling has shown benefits for language models, extending this to multimodal models remains challenging.

Method: UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to enable multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. It trains models on short reasoning trajectories and uses sequential chain-of-thought reasoning for test-time scaling.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning is more scalable and compute-efficient than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal test-time scaling is an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models, establishing UniT as a framework that enables iterative reasoning, verification, and refinement across multiple rounds.

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

*Huai-Hsun Cheng,Siang-Ling Zhang,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Semantic Illusions: A generative framework for vector sketches that transform semantically through sequential stroke addition, creating temporal visual anagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual illusions rely on spatial manipulations; this work aims to create temporal illusions where a single sketch transforms dramatically through sequential stroke additions, expanding visual anagrams from spatial to temporal dimensions.

Method: Stroke of Surprise framework uses sequence-aware joint optimization with dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize vector strokes satisfying dual constraints: initial strokes form one coherent object while serving as foundation for a second concept after adding delta strokes. Includes Overlay Loss for spatial complementarity.

Result: Method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully creating temporal visual illusions where sketches transform between different semantic interpretations.

Conclusion: The work introduces Progressive Semantic Illusions as a novel temporal dimension of visual anagrams, with the Stroke of Surprise framework effectively solving the dual-constraint optimization problem for vector sketch transformations.

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian framework for UAV navigation that addresses state drift by combining motion prediction with historical observation correction, outperforming baselines with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models for UAV navigation suffer from accumulated position errors over time due to stepwise dead-reckoning, leading to state drift that compromises trajectory prediction accuracy.

Method: Formulates navigation as recursive Bayesian state estimation with two processes: Prior Prediction (based on motion dynamics) and Likelihood Correction (from historical observation). Uses Kernel Density Estimation associated with attention-based retrieval to correct latent representations without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark show the method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation with only 10% of training data fine-tuning.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman effectively addresses state drift in UAV navigation by combining Bayesian estimation with attention-based correction, demonstrating superior performance with minimal training requirements.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

TL;DR: H-WM is a hierarchical world model that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions, combining symbolic reasoning's long-horizon robustness with visual grounding to improve robotic planning and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for robotics either focus on video generation or natural language prediction (difficult to ground in actions, suffer from compounding errors) or use symbolic logic models (robot-executable but disconnected from visual perception). There's a need for synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with a bilevel framework: high-level logical world model for symbolic reasoning and low-level visual world model for perceptual grounding. Trained on a robotic dataset aligning robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate effectiveness and generality. The hierarchical outputs provide stable intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully integrates symbolic reasoning's robot-executable, long-horizon robustness with visual grounding, enabling robust execution across extended task sequences through synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that bypasses full-body retargeting by operating directly on SE(3) poses of selected links, uses Cartesian-space mapping, and incorporates velocity feedforward to achieve 50ms latency for responsive tasks like ping-pong ball balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid link targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level for responsiveness under rapidly changing control interfaces.

Result: Achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms (substantially surpassing the 200ms limit of prior work) and enables highly responsive behaviors including ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides a low-latency teleoperation framework that enables highly responsive humanoid behaviors by avoiding full-body retargeting bottlenecks and incorporating velocity feedforward, making it suitable for tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless variations in scenes, objects, and tasks that are underrepresented in existing benchmarks. Physical evaluation alone cannot provide the scale and diversity needed to measure this level of generalization.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments (handcrafted and procedurally generated), 130k richly annotated objects (48k manipulable with 42M stable grasps), simulator-agnostic support for MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill, and MolmoSpaces-Bench benchmark suite of 8 tasks covering static/mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks.

Result: MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, ρ = 0.98). Experiments confirm newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research, addressing the need for large-scale, diverse evaluation infrastructure to measure real-world generalization.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

TL;DR: Learning robot behavior from human videos by modeling human preferences through motion prediction of tracked points, then optimizing robot policies using modified SAC with on-robot initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on reward learning from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value based on temporal distance to terminal states, make assumptions that limit performance, and must transfer learned value functions across embodiment and environment gaps.

Method: Models human preferences by learning to predict motion of tracked points between subsequent images, defines reward as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior, then uses modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function and optimize policy.

Result: Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating capability for real robot learning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the embodiment gap by learning human preferences from videos and applying them directly on robots through motion prediction-based rewards, enabling effective robot learning from egocentric human demonstrations.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot imitation learning is expensive due to large-scale real-world data collection costs, especially problematic for affordable home robots that need to be user-friendly and cost-effective.

Method: Extracts 3D hand trajectories from RGB videos, maps them to robot gripper control via action alignment, uses hand visual augmentation to bridge human-robot domain gap, and employs co-training with both human and minimal robot data.

Result: Achieves high performance on low-cost LeRobot platform across various manipulation tasks, significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, low-cost solution for bringing intelligent robots into homes by enabling rapid learning from human demonstrations with minimal robot-specific data.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A planning framework that integrates object search policies (LIOS actions) into task planning to handle unknown object locations while maintaining compatibility with existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning (like PDDL) assumes full environment knowledge and cannot handle unknown object locations, while standalone learning-driven search approaches are not easily integrated into full task planners that need to determine what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions - each is a policy for finding and retrieving a single object. High-level planning treats these as deterministic actions, using model-based calculations of expected search costs to generate plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: Outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal preparation in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world experiments. The approach is effective, sound, and complete for learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers, enabling robust task planning when object locations are unknown.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

Motivation: 4D mmWave radar is weather-robust and cost-effective but produces sparse, irregular point clouds with multipath noise, making radar-only 3D detection inferior to LiDAR-based systems. The goal is to enable radar to leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural changes.

Method: 1) Aggregates returns from multiple surround-view radars over consecutive frames; 2) Uses geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks; 3) Integrates foreground-focused diffusion module with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision; 4) Distills into consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint detectors, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR performance gap.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, demonstrating that improved radar point cloud quality can bridge the gap between radar and LiDAR performance.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go: A real-to-sim pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic navigation datasets using 3D Gaussian Splatting with human avatars to train robust navigation policies for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific deployment environments. Existing real-to-sim approaches assume static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, limiting their applicability to real-world dynamic scenarios.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator combining static scene reconstruction with animatable human GS avatars and plausible human motion synthesis from 2D trajectories, (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator with robot expert and human planners, (3) Policy learning using generated dynamic environment datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in presence of moving obstacles. Zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environments demonstrates generalization potential.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go successfully addresses the limitations of existing real-to-sim approaches by generating photorealistic dynamic scenarios, enabling training of robust navigation policies that work effectively in real-world dynamic environments with moving obstacles.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile fusion methods use simple concatenation and focus mainly on feature alignment, failing to exploit the complementary nature of modalities and struggling with occluded scenarios, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS framework with Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and CVAE module to utilize both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, demonstrating effectiveness in handling occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework for visuo-tactile fusion that better exploits modality complementarity and alignment, enabling improved robotic manipulation performance in real-world scenarios including occlusions.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: This paper develops neural network models (LSTM and Transformer) to predict human gaze behavior in social interactions, including responses to non-human stimuli, and deploys the system on a NAO robot for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt their gaze behavior like humans to enhance communication effectiveness. Current research lacks investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, which is crucial for robots to remain receptive to all cues in social interactions.

Method: Collected gaze data from 41 participants using VR glasses in both animated (Unity 3D) and real-world (360° video) scenarios. Preprocessed data and trained LSTM and Transformer neural networks to predict gaze patterns. Deployed the system on a NAO robot and evaluated with 275 participants via questionnaire.

Result: LSTM achieved 67.6% and Transformer 70.4% accuracy in animated scenarios; LSTM 72% and Transformer 71.6% in real-world scenarios. Models outperformed existing approaches and uniquely considered non-human stimuli. Questionnaire results showed high satisfaction during robot interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts, including responses to both human and non-human stimuli, improving communication effectiveness.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attention mechanisms and structured curriculum learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-object interaction methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history, projects these predictions onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a robust framework for humanoid robots to interact with diverse object dynamics without external state estimation, enabling successful completion of complex whole-body tasks with underactuated objects in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that learns continuous language-driven maps for efficient, fine-grained robot navigation without explicit language vector storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid/node-based maps struggle with scalability in large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning.

Method: LAMP encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than explicit storage, combines it with a sparse graph for coarse path planning, then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. Uses Bayesian framework for embedding uncertainty and graph sampling for scalability.

Result: LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor building experiments.

Conclusion: LAMP demonstrates that implicit neural language fields combined with coarse-to-fine planning enable scalable, precise navigation in large environments while maintaining memory efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies for semantic manipulation have limited generalization in real-world robotics because text-only instructions are insufficient to direct attention to target objects in complex, dynamic environments.

Method: 1) Uses bounding-box instructions to directly specify target objects; 2) Develops Label-UMI, a handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline for efficient demonstration data collection; 3) Proposes semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection with bounding-box guided diffusion policy.

Result: Validated effectiveness through extensive real-world experiments, revealed power-law relationship between generalization performance and number of bounding-box objects, and achieved 85% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

Conclusion: Bounding-box instructions significantly improve diffusion policy generalization for semantic manipulation, with scaling laws suggesting data quantity matters. The proposed data collection strategy enables high success rates, and all datasets/code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid controllers struggle with adapting to diverse motion distributions, suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions, and lack robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Task-specific training requirements limit generalization capabilities.

Method: FAST introduces two key components: 1) Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation - learns lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints for efficient adaptation while mitigating catastrophic forgetting; 2) Center-of-Mass-Aware Control - incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance during challenging motion tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment show FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that addresses key challenges in motion adaptation, stability, and generalization, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from diffusion models into deterministic vision backbones for better robot manipulation, addressing the mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and geometric-sensitive control needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision backbones for robot manipulation have a structural mismatch: they optimize for semantic invariance (good for classification) but manipulation requires geometric sensitivity to detect millimeter-level pose changes. Diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies but are too stochastic and slow for real-time control.

Method: Propose Robot-DIFT framework using Manifold Distillation to decouple geometric information from inference. Distill a frozen diffusion teacher model into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), retaining rich geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability and real-time execution.

Result: Pretrained on DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, showing that how a model learns to see affects how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not just data scale or policy capacity, but the structural mismatch between vision backbones and physical control requirements. Robot-DIFT bridges this gap by distilling generative geometric priors into deterministic vision models for better manipulation performance.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate RL training for robot manipulation, improving sample efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-in-the-Loop RL methods for robot manipulation suffer from scalability issues (1:1 supervision ratio), operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: AGPS uses a multimodal agent as a semantic world model to inject intrinsic value priors, providing precise guidance through corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning.

Result: AGPS outperforms Human-in-the-Loop methods in sample efficiency on precision insertion and deformable object manipulation tasks, enabling automated supervision.

Conclusion: AGPS automates the robot learning supervision pipeline, enabling labor-free and scalable training for generalist manipulation skills.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective decentralized multi-robot maritime monitoring with robust perception and coordination under communication constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

Motivation: Current MAPF approaches have limitations: open-loop planners struggle with disturbances, while closed-loop heuristics lack performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical warehouse and logistics applications.

Method: ACCBS builds on finite-horizon CBS with MPC-inspired iterative deepening. It dynamically adjusts planning horizon based on computational budget and reuses a single constraint tree for seamless horizon transitions.

Result: ACCBS produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. It combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees.

Conclusion: ACCBS effectively bridges the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment, offering both disturbance handling and performance guarantees.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

### [96] [When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032)
*Jingxian Lu,Wenke Xia,Yuxuan Wu,Zhiwu Lu,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-proprioception policies often fail to generalize because proprioception dominates learning during motion-transition phases, suppressing visual learning. GAP algorithm adaptively modulates proprioception gradients based on phase probabilities to enable better collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioception is critical for robotic control, and its collaboration with vision should enhance manipulation performance, but inconsistent generalization results in vision-proprioception policies need investigation.

Method: Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm: uses proprioception to estimate probability of timesteps belonging to motion-transition phases, then applies fine-grained gradient reduction for proprioception based on these probabilities to balance learning.

Result: GAP enables robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies across simulated and real-world environments, one-arm and dual-arm setups, and is compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into developing effective vision-proprioception policies by addressing proprioception dominance during motion-transition phases through adaptive gradient modulation.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution, particularly for control systems operating in uncertain environments.

Method: Uses weighted conformal prediction with learned state-control-dependent covariance to derive high-confidence model error bounds, integrated into system level synthesis-based robust nonlinear MPC with constraint tightening via volume-optimized forward reachable sets.

Result: Theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, with empirical demonstrations on nonlinear systems (4D car and 12D quadcopter) showing improved safety and robustness compared to baselines, especially outside data distribution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines statistical learning (conformal prediction) with control theory (system level synthesis) to achieve robust out-of-distribution planning with provable safety guarantees, addressing a critical challenge in learning-based control.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

TL;DR: Iterative online improvement of VLA models using a learned simulator that's refined with real-world data to generate synthetic rollouts for policy enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollout collection is expensive, and existing world models lack physical fidelity for policy improvement, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks with critical physical details.

Method: Proposes iterative improvement algorithm: uses real-world rollout data to improve world model fidelity, then uses enhanced world model to generate synthetic data for VLA model improvement.

Result: Achieves 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of world models with real data enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, overcoming limitations of existing demonstration-trained simulators.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Conclusion: AGT-World provides a unified framework for autonomous construction of interactive simulated environments and robot policies, enabling scalable robot learning through structured task decomposition and self-evolution with hybrid feedback.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Contact-aware bin-packing approach that uses purposeful interactions with existing items to create space for new placements in partially filled containers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation needs to handle real-world scenarios where containers are already partially filled with items in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation, unlike prior work that focused on empty containers and collision-free strategies.

Method: Uses a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with physics-aware perception system for pose estimation during occlusions, and a method for suggesting physically-feasible placement locations.

Result: The approach enables successful placement of new items by exploiting purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space.

Conclusion: Contact-aware packing that leverages interactions with existing items is crucial for practical warehouse automation where containers are rarely empty and items are often in suboptimal arrangements.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning algorithms for high-dimensional robotic systems often produce unpredictable motions or require excessive computational resources. There's a need for efficient planning that generates consistent motions while being computationally feasible for real-time operation.

Method: MGS generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. It maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing disconnected subgraphs to merge through feasible transitions during search.

Result: The authors prove MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks. The algorithm shows improved performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: MGS provides an efficient motion planning solution for high-dimensional robotic systems that balances computational efficiency with motion quality, making it suitable for real-time deployment in manipulation and mobile manipulation applications.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 3DGSNav: A zero-shot object navigation framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning and improve navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods rely on scene abstractions (semantic maps or textual representations) that constrain high-level decision making by low-level perception accuracy. There's a need for better spatial reasoning capabilities in navigation systems.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for VLMs, incrementally constructing 3DGS representations through active perception. Features trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware views, structured visual prompts with Chain-of-Thought prompting, real-time object detection filtering, and VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav provides an effective framework for zero-shot object navigation that enhances spatial reasoning through 3DGS memory and structured prompting, achieving reliable performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient deformation gaits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric model that captures overall locomotion efficiency by accounting for both environmental drag energy and metabolic/actuator energy required for shape changes in slender locomotors like snakes and robots.

Method: Formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics, with continuous model and consistent discretization for numerical computation of optimal deformation gaits under various boundary conditions.

Result: The model successfully computes optimal deformation gaits that qualitatively match observed biological motions (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results (Purcell's swimmers), while enabling new insights into locomotion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The geometric sub-Riemannian approach provides a flexible framework for understanding and optimizing shape-change-induced locomotion, capturing both environmental and internal energy dissipation, with applications to biological and robotic systems.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, outperforming prior methods on various robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models rely heavily on behavior cloning which discards transferable dynamics knowledge from heterogeneous embodied data. While Unified World Models could leverage diverse data, existing implementations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: LDA-1B jointly learns dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting by assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. It uses a structured DINO latent space for scalable dynamics learning to avoid redundant pixel-space appearance modeling, and employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams for stable training at 1B-parameter scale. The model is trained on EI-30k, a standardized 30k-hour embodied interaction dataset.

Result: LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. It enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% improvement by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories that are typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates that scalable robot foundation models can be built through universal embodied data ingestion with proper architectural choices (structured latent space and multi-modal diffusion transformer), enabling effective utilization of heterogeneous data quality and achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Motivation: Existing LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability in large household environments, degrading with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity.

Method: AHAT uses LLMs trained to convert task instructions and textual scene graphs into PDDL subgoals, then performs explicit symbolic reasoning for optimal planning. TGPO reinforcement learning integrates external correction of reasoning traces into GRPO to improve intention decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, especially in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Conclusion: AHAT provides an effective solution for scalable open-world language-conditioned task planning in large household environments by combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning and enhanced reinforcement learning for intention decomposition.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still misalign actions with natural language instructions, creating an "intention-action gap" that hinders general-purpose robot capabilities.

Method: Developed CoVer (contrastive verifier) with test-time scaling laws, boot-time compute, and hierarchical verification pipeline that precomputes diverse instruction rephrasings, generates multiple action candidates, and selects optimal prompts/actions.

Result: 22% in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution gains on SIMPLER benchmark, 45% improvement in real-world experiments, and 14% task progress/9% success rate gains on PolaRiS benchmark.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with contrastive learning effectively reduces intention-action gaps in VLAs, outperforming policy pre-training scaling and improving real-world robot performance.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

Result: Case study shows the proposed task-oriented scheme outperforms conventional communication-oriented schemes in terms of task controlling performance.

Conclusion: Task-oriented design is superior for autonomous operations via satellite communications, but practical implementation faces open research challenges in collaborative SC3 systems.

Abstract: Direct-to-cell (D2C) satellite communications have emerged as a crucial alternative and complement to terrestrial communication networks for autonomous operations due to their wide-area coverage capability. Unlike human-oriented communications, robot-oriented D2C communications in autonomous operations place greater emphasis on task completion rather than solely on data transmission. Such differences require us to evaluate the performance of each stage in the system and consider the integrated optimization. Motivated by this, we model the system in a sensing-communication-computing-control (SC3) closed-loop manner and analyze it from an entropy-based perspective, based on which a task-oriented system design method is developed. Furthermore, to manage the complexity of the closed-loop system, we decompose it into fine-grained functional structures and investigate the key challenges associated with collaborative sensing, collaborative computing, and collaborative control. A case study is presented to compare the proposed task-oriented scheme with conventional communication-oriented schemes, showing that the proposed method performs better in terms of task controlling. Finally, we discuss several open research challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation.

*Advait Balaji,Trevor Teolis,S. David Mis,Jose Antonio Lara Benitez,Chao Wang,Maarten V. de Hoop*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Hybrid FNO-transformer architecture for wave scattering in high-contrast media achieves better accuracy than standalone operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators struggle with wave propagation in high-contrast settings like salt bodies, which exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge current methods.

Method: Propose hybrid architecture that decomposes scattering operator into smooth background propagation (learned with FNO) and high-contrast scattering correction (modeled with vision transformer attention). FNO produces globally coupled feature tokens, then transformer handles strong spatial interactions.

Result: Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling.

Conclusion: The hybrid FNO-transformer approach effectively handles challenging high-contrast wave scattering problems, outperforming individual operator architectures.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling of wave propagation and scattering (i.e. the wave speed and source to wave field map) in heterogeneous media has significant potential in applications such as seismic imaging and inversion. High-contrast settings, such as subsurface models with salt bodies, exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge existing neural operators. We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling.

### [112] [Target Induced Angle Grid Regularized Estimation for Ghost Identification in Automotive Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11441)
*Junho Kweon,Vishal Monga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: TIGRE algorithm improves ghost target detection in automotive radar by adding physics-inspired regularization to multipath angle estimation, enhancing robustness in low SNR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar ghost targets from multipath reflections (e.g., guardrails) create false detections that challenge autonomous navigation. Existing MP-IAA method struggles in low SNR environments.

Method: Proposes TIGRE algorithm that incorporates a physics-inspired regularizer into the estimation cost function to capture structural patterns of multipath propagation. The regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid, and the algorithm iteratively minimizes this regularized loss.

Result: Numerical experiments show TIGRE substantially improves angle-grid estimation quality across various multipath scenarios, especially in low SNR environments, providing more reliable basis for ghost target identification.

Conclusion: The physics-inspired regularization approach in TIGRE enhances robustness of ghost target detection in automotive radar systems, particularly addressing limitations of previous methods in challenging low SNR conditions.

Abstract: This study presents a novel algorithm for identifying ghost targets in automotive radar by estimating complex valued signal strength across a two-dimensional angle grid defined by direction-of-arrival (DOA) and direction-of-departure (DOD). In real-world driving environments, radar signals often undergo multipath propagation due to reflections from surfaces such as guardrails. These indirect paths can produce ghost targets - false detections that appear at incorrect locations - posing challenges to autonomous navigation. A recent method, the Multi-Path Iterative Adaptive Approach (MP-IAA), addresses this by jointly estimating the DOA/DOD angle grid, identifying mismatches as indicators of ghost targets. However, its effectiveness declines in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. To enhance robustness, we introduce a physics-inspired regularizer that captures structural patterns inherent to multipath propagation. This regularizer is incorporated into the estimation cost, forming a new loss function that guides our proposed algorithm, TIGRE (Target-Induced angle-Grid Regularized Estimation). TIGRE iteratively minimizes this regularized loss and we show that our proposed regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances the quality of angle-grid estimation across various multipath scenarios, particularly in low SNR environments, providing a more reliable basis for subsequent ghost target identification.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks are effective for wall characterization in through-wall radar applications, enabling potential deconvolution of wall effects from target scattering.

Abstract: Electromagnetic wave propagation through complex inhomogeneous walls introduces significant distortions to through-wall radar signatures. Estimation of wall thickness, dielectric, and conductivity profiles may enable wall effects to be deconvolved from target scattering. We propose to use deep neural networks (DNNs) to estimate wall characteristics from broadband scattered electric fields on the same side of the wall as the transmitter. We demonstrate that both single deep artificial and convolutional neural networks and dual networks involving generative adversarial networks are capable of performing the highly nonlinear regression operation of electromagnetic inverse scattering for wall characterization. These networks are trained with simulation data generated from full wave solvers and validated on both simulated and real wall data with approximately 95% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ACR sensing suffers from weak detection metrics due to low multipath signal strength when detecting targets around corners in NLOS conditions.

Method: Application of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to direct incident beams into NLOS regions, strategically deploying RIS to improve radar sensing in ACR scenarios.

Result: Experimental results at 5.5 GHz demonstrate successful capture of micro-Doppler signatures of walking humans in NLOS conditions through RIS deployment.

Conclusion: RIS technology effectively enhances radar sensing capabilities in around-the-corner scenarios by overcoming multipath signal limitations and enabling detection of human motion signatures.

Abstract: Around-the-corner radar (ACR) sensing of targets in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions has been explored for security and surveillance applications and look-ahead warning systems in automotive scenarios. Here, the targets are detected around corners without direct line-of-sight (LOS) propagation by exploiting multipath bounces from the walls. However, the overall detection metrics are weak due to the low strength of the multipath signals. Our study presents the application of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to improve radar sensing in ACR scenarios by directing incident beams on the RIS into NLOS regions. Experimental results at 5.5 GHz demonstrate that micro-Doppler signatures of the walking motion of humans can now be captured in NLOS conditions through the strategic deployment of RIS.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how practical phase tuning limitations affect RIS performance for around-the-corner radar sensing, comparing idealized analog phase shifts with practical one-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional around-the-corner radar sensing is limited to detecting targets at specular angles. While RIS can enhance coverage by directing beams to non-specular angles, practical implementation constraints like phase tuning granularity need investigation.

Method: The study examines two RIS configurations: 1) idealized analog phase shifts for single-beam patterns, and 2) practical one-bit quantized phase shifts producing dual symmetric beams. Both are benchmarked against a metal plate of similar dimensions using simulations and measurements.

Result: The research compares radar cross-section (RCS) performance between the two RIS configurations and the metal plate benchmark, analyzing how phase quantization affects beam patterns and detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Practical phase tuning constraints significantly impact RIS performance for around-the-corner radar sensing, with one-bit quantization leading to dual-beam patterns instead of ideal single-beam patterns, affecting detection capabilities.

Abstract: Around-the-corner radar sensing offers an opportunity for the radar to exploit multipath scattering along walls to detect targets beyond blockages. However, the radar detection performance is limited to spotting uncooperative targets at specular angles. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) involving metasurfaces with tunable unit cells have been researched for enhancing radar coverage around corners by directing beams towards non-specular angles. This article examines how practical considerations regarding the phase tuning of unit cells impact the RIS performance. Specifically, we examine the radar cross-section (RCS) obtained from two RIS configurations: In the first, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a theoretical analog phase shift to realize idealized one-beam patterns at the desired angles. In the second configuration, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a low-complexity, one-bit quantized element phase shift, which results in dual symmetric beams. The RIS configurations are then benchmarked with a metal plate of similar dimensions in both simulations and measurements.

*Hong-Bae Jeon*

TL;DR: FRIS-assisted downlink beamforming with discrete phase codebook solved via AO framework combining MRT at BS and Minkowski-geometry-based FRIS configuration optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of beamforming-gain maximization in FRIS-assisted systems with discrete phase codebooks, which creates a highly nonconvex mixed discrete optimization problem coupling BS beamformer with combinatorial FRIS port selection and discrete phase assignment.

Method: Alternating-optimization (AO) framework with closed-form MRT update at BS and optimal FRIS configuration update. FRIS subproblem reformulated using Minkowski geometry: convexifying reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities to convert to 1D maximization over directional parameter. For each direction, optimal configuration obtained via per-port directional scoring, Top-Mo port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For regular Mp-gon codebook, derived closed-form scores and piecewise-smooth support function structure enabling finite critical-angle search.

Result: Proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in exhaustive-search validations, accurately identifies optimal direction via support-function maximization, and converges rapidly within few AO iterations.

Conclusion: The developed AO framework with Minkowski-geometry reformulation effectively solves the challenging FRIS beamforming problem with discrete phase codebooks, providing optimal or near-optimal solutions with efficient computation and rapid convergence.

Abstract: This paper investigates beamforming-gain maximization for a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS)-assisted downlink system, where each active port applies a finite-resolution unit-modulus phase selected from a discrete codebook. The resulting design couples the multi-antenna base-station (BS) beamformer with combinatorial FRIS port selection and discrete phase assignment, leading to a highly nonconvex mixed discrete optimization. To address this challenge, we develop an alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternates between a closed-form maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) update at the BS and an {optimal} FRIS-configuration update. The key step of the proposed FRIS configuration is a Minkowski-geometry reformulation of the FRIS codebook superposition: by convexifying the feasible reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities, we convert the FRIS subproblem into a one-dimensional maximization over a directional parameter. For each direction, the optimal configuration is obtained constructively via per-port directional scoring, Top-$M_o$ port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For the practically important regular $M_p$-gon phase-shifter codebook, we further derive closed-form score expressions and establish a piecewise-smooth structure of the resulting support function, which leads to a finite critical-angle search that provably identifies the global optimum without exhaustive angular sweeping. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in exhaustive-search validations, accurately identifies the optimal direction via support-function maximization, and converges rapidly within a few AO iterations.

*Chongjun Ouyang,Hao Jiang,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PASS enables wireless channel reconfiguration via pinching antennas on dielectric waveguides. A unified framework analyzes maintainability by modeling waveguide failures/repairs as exponential random variables, using continuous-time Markov chains. System maintainability is measured via probability of non-zero rate and outage probability, comparing conventional PASS with segmented SWAN architectures under segment switching and segment aggregation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and quantify the maintainability of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) for wireless channel reconfiguration, particularly comparing conventional single-waveguide systems with segmented architectures that could offer better reliability and maintainability through redundancy and segmentation strategies.

Method: Developed a unified analytical framework modeling waveguide failures and repairs as exponentially distributed random variables. Used continuous-time Markov chains to describe waveguide operational states. Incorporated randomness into transmission rate analysis. Applied framework to both conventional PASS (single long waveguide) and SWAN (multiple short segments) under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Derived closed-form expressions for probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP).

Result: Both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, confirming maintainability advantage of segmentation. Maintainability gain of SWAN over conventional PASS increases with number of segments. SA provides stronger maintainability than SS. Derived scaling laws with respect to service-region size and number of segments.

Conclusion: Segmentation in pinching-antenna systems significantly improves maintainability. SWAN architectures outperform conventional PASS, with segment aggregation providing the strongest maintainability benefits. The analytical framework successfully quantifies maintainability advantages of segmented waveguide systems.

Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) enables wireless channel reconfiguration through optimized placement of pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides. In this article, a unified analytical framework is proposed to characterize the maintainability of PASS. Within this framework, random waveguide failures and repairs are modeled by treating the waveguide lifetime and repair time as exponentially distributed random variables, which are characterized by the failure rate and the repair rate, respectively. The operational state of the waveguide is described by a two-state continuous-time Markov chain, for which the transition probabilities and steady-state probabilities of the waveguide being working or failed are analyzed. By incorporating the randomness of the waveguide operational state into the transmission rate, system maintainability is characterized using the probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP). The proposed framework is applied to both a conventional PASS employing a single long waveguide and a segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) composed of multiple short waveguide segments under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Closed-form expressions for the PNR and OP are derived for both architectures, and the corresponding scaling laws are analyzed with respect to the service-region size and the number of segments. It is proven that both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, which confirms the maintainability advantage of segmentation. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the maintainability gain of SWAN over conventional PASS increases with the number of segments, and ii) SA provides stronger maintainability than SS.

TL;DR: EqDeepRx is a practical deep-learning-aided MIMO receiver that combines linear processing with engineered ML blocks for near-linear complexity scaling, better explainability, and improved performance over conventional receivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML-based receiver algorithms suffer from poor scaling with increasing spatial multiplexing order, lack of explainability, and poor generalization capabilities.

Method: Augments linear receiver processing with carefully engineered ML blocks: retains conventional channel estimation with DenoiseNN for frequency-domain smoothing, uses parallel LMMSE and RZF equalizers to reduce DetectorNN input dimensionality, employs shared-weight DetectorNN operating independently per spatial stream, and uses compact DemapperNN for bit log-likelihood ratios.

Result: 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over conventional baselines across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions, while maintaining low-complexity inference and supporting different MIMO configurations without retraining.

Conclusion: EqDeepRx provides a practical deep-learning-aided MIMO receiver solution that addresses key limitations of existing ML-based approaches through careful engineering of ML blocks integrated with conventional linear processing, achieving better performance with near-linear complexity scaling and improved explainability.

Abstract: While machine learning (ML)-based receiver algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the recent literature, they often suffer from poor scaling with increasing spatial multiplexing order and lack of explainability and generalization. This paper presents EqDeepRx, a practical deep-learning-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver, which is built by augmenting linear receiver processing with carefully engineered ML blocks. At the core of the receiver model is a shared-weight DetectorNN that operates independently on each spatial stream or layer, enabling near-linear complexity scaling with respect to multiplexing order. To ensure better explainability and generalization, EqDeepRx retains conventional channel estimation and augments it with a lightweight DenoiseNN that learns frequency-domain smoothing. To reduce the dimensionality of the DetectorNN inputs, the receiver utilizes two linear equalizers in parallel: a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equalizer with interference-plus-noise covariance estimation and a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) equalizer. The parallel equalized streams are jointly consumed by the DetectorNN, after which a compact DemapperNN produces bit log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding. 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over a conventional baseline, while maintaining low-complexity inference and support for different MIMO configurations without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study spectral efficiency of RSMA in practical cell-free massive MIMO systems with real-world impairments like spatially-correlated Rician channels, random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility.

Method: Analyzes RSMA-enabled multi-clustered CF mMIMO where APs in each cluster serve UEs using RSMA, with UEs employing successive interference cancellation. Emphasizes role of downlink pilots in practical scenarios with channel aging.

Result: DL pilots are required for RSMA to outperform spatial division multiple access in user-centric CF mMIMO with channel aging. Higher UE velocity and longer resource blocks significantly reduce RSMA SE, but increasing number of clusters can compensate for SE loss.

Conclusion: RSMA with DL pilots provides performance benefits in practical cell-free massive MIMO systems despite channel impairments, but system design must account for mobility effects and consider cluster scaling to maintain spectral efficiency.

Abstract: We study the spectral efficiency (SE) of a ratesplitting multiple access (RSMA) enabled multi-clustered cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The access points (APs) in each cluster serve mobile user equipments (UEs) by employing RSMA. The UEs employ successive interference cancellation to decode their data. This work emphasizes the role of downlink (DL) pilots in realizing RSMA benefits in practical CF systems with spatially-correlated Rician channels which observe random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility. We numerically show that DL pilots are required for RSMA in user-centric CF mMIMO systems with channel aging to outperform spatial division multiple access. We show that the degraded channel quality due to higher UE velocity and longer resource block lengths significantly reduces the RSMA SE. Increasing the number of clusters can compensate for the SE loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing radio map prediction methods assume perfect environment information, which is unrealistic due to sensor limitations, mapping errors, and temporal changes in real-world deployments.

Method: Train convolutional neural networks with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and transmitter positions to make models robust to inaccurate environment inputs. Compare different environment encoding methods including binary occupancy vs detailed material properties.

Result: Models trained with perturbed data reduce error by up to 25% on synthetic indoor scenarios with noisy inputs. Achieved 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input and 1.3 dB with complete information on real-world measurements, outperforming classical methods (2.3-3.1 dB). Binary occupancy encoding performs as well as detailed material properties.

Conclusion: Training with perturbed environment data enables implicit compensation for prediction errors from inaccurate inputs. Binary occupancy encoding simplifies practical deployment while maintaining performance, making the approach more feasible for real-world applications.

Abstract: Many works have investigated radio map and path loss prediction in wireless networks using deep learning, in particular using convolutional neural networks. However, most assume perfect environment information, which is unrealistic in practice due to sensor limitations, mapping errors, and temporal changes. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and Tx positions can implicitly compensate for prediction errors caused by inaccurate environment inputs. When tested with noisy inputs on synthetic indoor scenarios, models trained with perturbed environment data reduce error by up to 25\% compared to models trained on clean data. We verify our approach on real-world measurements, achieving 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input data and 1.3 dB with complete information, compared to 2.3-3.1 dB for classical methods such as ray-tracing and radial basis function interpolation. Additionally, we compare different ways of encoding environment information at varying levels of detail and we find that, in the considered single-room indoor scenarios, binary occupancy encoding performs at least as well as detailed material property information, simplifying practical deployment.

*Ahmed Magbool,Vaibhav Kumar,Marco Di Renzo,Mark F. Flanagan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Flexible stacked intelligent metasurfaces (DSIM and SFIM) with adjustable interlayer distances or fully morphable layers outperform rigid SIMs by mitigating performance saturation and reducing power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SIM designs use rigid planar layers with fixed spacing, which constrains propagation geometry and leads to performance saturation as layer count increases. This paper explores introducing structural flexibility to overcome these limitations.

Method: Two flexible SIM architectures: DSIM (optimized interlayer distances) and SFIM (fully morphable layers). Joint optimization of meta-atom positions/responses and transmit beamformer under various constraints using alternating optimization framework with gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation.

Result: Flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs. Perturbation analysis shows flexibility gains scale approximately linearly with morphing range, with SFIM having faster growth rate.

Conclusion: Introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems through DSIM and SFIM architectures provides substantial performance improvements over rigid SIM designs, enabling better wave-domain signal processing and more efficient wireless communications.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as a promising metasurface-based physical-layer paradigm for wireless communications, enabling wave-domain signal processing through multiple cascaded metasurface layers. However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear precoding techniques (like MMSE) require excessive antennas to meet error-rate targets, leading to high power consumption. Non-linear methods like Vector Perturbation offer better spectral efficiency but are impractical due to exponentially increasing computational complexity.

Method: Extends NL-COMM principles to downlink precoding, creating a scalable parallelization framework with novel mathematical formulation and FPGA prototype supporting 16x16 MIMO, 256-QAM, and 100 MHz bandwidth within practical power budgets.

Result: Achieves target error rates with only half the transmit antennas required by linear precoding, saving hundreds of Watts at RF front end. Enables supporting more information streams than available AP antennas for low-rate streams.

Conclusion: ViPer NL-COMM provides the first practical implementation of VP-based precoding, enabling massive connectivity scenarios in next-generation wireless networks with significant power savings and spectral efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large MIMO systems rely on efficient downlink precoding to enhance data rates and improve connectivity through spatial multiplexing. However, currently employed linear precoding techniques, such as MMSE, significantly limit the achievable spectral efficiency. To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end. Moreover, ViPer NL-COMM enables supporting more information streams than available AP antennas when the streams are of low-rate, paving the way for enhanced massive-connectivity scenarios in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: A tutorial comparing continuous-time and discrete-time LTI systems, focusing on shared dynamics and implementation differences, using first-order systems to illustrate core concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between formal mathematical descriptions of linear time-invariant systems and practical intuition needed for reliable system design in mixed analog-digital environments.

Revisits foundational concepts (transfer functions, poles/zeros, impulse responses, stability) from an operational perspective rooted in practical signal processing and circuit implementation.

Result: Provides a coherent framework showing how integration, differentiation, filtering, and delay manifest across Laplace and Z domains, with emphasis on causality, bandwidth limitations, sampling effects, and discrete-time approximation errors.

Conclusion: The tutorial successfully connects mathematical formalism with practical design intuition, highlighting both the shared dynamical structure of continuous/discrete systems and the physical constraints that differentiate their realizations in mixed analog-digital environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified tutorial treatment of continuous-time and discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, emphasizing their shared dynamical structure and the physical constraints that differentiate their realizations. Rather than introducing new mathematical tools, the manuscript revisits foundational concepts-transfer functions, poles and zeros, impulse responses, and stability-from an operational perspective rooted in practical signal processing and circuit implementation. First-order systems are used as a minimal yet expressive framework to illustrate how integration, differentiation, filtering, and delay manifest across the Laplace and Z domains. Particular attention is given to causality, bandwidth limitations, sampling effects, and the approximation errors inherent in discrete-time representations. The goal is to bridge the gap between formal mathematical descriptions and the intuition required for reliable system design in mixed analog-digital environments.

*Kalpesh K. Patel,Malay Chakraborty,Ekant Sharma,Sandeep Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: GenAI models (GCDM & GCDIM) optimize RIS phase shifts in cell-free mMIMO systems under practical constraints, matching expert algorithm performance with dramatically reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient phase shift optimization for RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems under practical constraints (imperfect CSI, spatial correlation) to overcome computational inefficiency of traditional expert algorithms.

Method: Two GenAI approaches: Generative Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM) and Generative Conditional Diffusion Implicit Model (GCDIM), both conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize sum spectral efficiency.

Result: GCDM matches expert algorithm's sum SE with reduced computational overhead; GCDIM achieves comparable SE with 98% reduction in computation time compared to expert algorithm.

Conclusion: GenAI-based approaches, particularly GCDIM, offer efficient phase optimization for RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This work investigates a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) model to optimize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase shifts in RIS-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems under practical constraints, including imperfect channel state information (CSI) and spatial correlation. We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that GCDM matches the sum SE achieved by the expert algorithm while significantly reducing the computational overhead. Furthermore, GCDIM achieves a comparable sum SE with an additional $98\%$ reduction in computation time, underscoring its potential for efficient phase optimization in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems.

*Xiaodan Shao,Chuangye Shan,Weihua Zhuang,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a distributed flexible coupler array with movable passive couplers around fixed active antennas to enhance MIMO communication performance with low hardware cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-performance multiuser MIMO communication without the high hardware cost and power consumption of fully active antenna arrays, while avoiding the complexity of moving entire active antennas.

Method: Uses FC arrays with fixed active antennas and movable passive couplers, formulates optimization problems for sum rate maximization, develops distributed coupler position optimization algorithm, and designs pilot-assisted centralized/distributed channel estimation algorithms.

Result: FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks, approaches fully active array performance with significantly reduced hardware cost/power consumption, and proposed channel estimation outperforms benchmarks in pilot overhead and accuracy.

Conclusion: Distributed FC array architecture provides a cost-effective solution for enhancing MIMO communication performance through movable passive couplers, with effective optimization algorithms and channel estimation methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed flexible coupler (FC) array to enhance communication performance with low hardware cost. At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy.

### [127] [Non-signaling Assisted Capacity of a Classical Channel with Causal CSIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11568)
*Yuhang Yao,Syed A. Jafar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: NS-assisted capacity for classical channel with causal CSIT equals non-causal CSIT capacity: C^{NS,ca} = max_{P_{X|S}} I(X;Y|S). Same capacity holds when state is also available to receiver. However, error probability improves when receiver has state in causal setting, unlike non-causal setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the non-signaling assisted capacity of classical channels with causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and compare it with non-causal CSIT setting and settings where state is also available to the receiver.

Method: Analyze classical channel with causal CSIT under non-signaling assistance, derive capacity expression using information-theoretic techniques, and compare with previously established results for non-causal CSIT and receiver-side state availability.

Result: C^{NS,ca} = max_{P_{X|S}} I(X;Y|S), which equals C^{NS,nc} (non-causal CSIT capacity) and also matches capacity when state is available to both transmitter and receiver. However, optimal error probability improves when receiver has state in causal setting, unlike non-causal setting.

Conclusion: Non-signaling assistance equalizes capacity for causal and non-causal CSIT settings, but error probability behavior differs: receiver-side state helps in causal setting but not in non-causal setting.

Abstract: The non-signaling (NS) assisted capacity of a classical channel with causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is shown to be $C^{NS,ca}=\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\mid S)$, where $X, Y, S$ correspond to the input, output and state of the channel. Remarkably, this is the same as the capacity of the channel in the NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting, $C^{NS,nc}=\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\mid S)$, which was previously established, and also matches the (either classical or with NS assistance) capacity of the channel where the state is available not only (either causally or non-causally) to the transmitter but also to the receiver. While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver. This is in contrast to corresponding NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting where it was previously noted that the optimal probability of error cannot be further improved by providing the state to the receiver.

### [128] [The Arithmetic Singleton Bound on the Hamming Distances of Simple-rooted Constacyclic Codes over Finite Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11788)
*Li Zhu,Hongfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Novel arithmetic Singleton bound for constacyclic codes using MED representations, tighter than classical Singleton bound due to algebraic obstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a systematic connection between arithmetic structure and distance constraints for constacyclic codes, revealing that Singleton bound limitations may stem from algebraic obstructions rather than linear constraints.

Method: Introduces multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of defining sets, generalizing cyclotomic coset representations. Proves each MED representation induces an upper bound on minimum distance, with arithmetic Singleton bound being the strongest among them.

Result: Arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as classical Singleton bound. For irreducible constacyclic codes, bound is explicitly ω+1, where ω relates to order of q modulo polynomial order radical. Provides criterion for when arithmetic bound is strictly tighter.

Conclusion: First systematic translation of arithmetic structure into distance constraints, showing Singleton bound unattainability may arise from algebraic obstructions rather than linear limitations.

Abstract: This paper establishes a novel upper bound-termed the arithmetic Singleton bound-on the Hamming distance of any simple-root constacyclic code over a finite field. The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $ω+1$, where $ω$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order. This work provides the first systematic translation of arithmetic structure-via MED representations-into restrictive constraints on the minimum distance, revealing that the Singleton bound may be unattainable not because of linear limitations, but due to underlying algebraic obstructions.

### [129] [A Comparative Study of MAP and LMMSE Estimators for Blind Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11814)
*Nathan Buskulic,Luca Calatroni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: MAP methods are unstable for blind inverse problems despite controlled conditions, while LMMSE estimators provide robust baselines and can improve MAP initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP approaches work well for inverse problems with known forward operators but become unstable in blind settings due to non-convexity and non-identifiability. LMMSE estimators offer a promising alternative that could overcome these limitations.

Method: Study synthetic 2D blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions with complete prior knowledge of signal and kernel distributions. Compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators (functionally similar to optimal Tikhonov estimators).

Result: Even in highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning. LMMSE estimators yield robust and reliable baselines. LMMSE solutions can effectively initialize MAP approaches, improving performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters.

Conclusion: LMMSE estimators provide a robust baseline for blind inverse problems and can enhance MAP methods through better initialization, opening avenues for future theoretical and practical developments in blind deconvolution.

Abstract: Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) approaches are an effective framework for inverse problems with known forward operators, particularly when combined with expressive priors and careful parameter selection. In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified Cramér-Rao bound framework for transmission activity detection in fluid antenna systems and conventional fixed-position antenna systems, deriving closed-form CRB expressions and demonstrating FAS's spatial-diversity gains with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize fundamental performance limits of transmission activity detection across different antenna architectures (FAS vs FPA systems) and provide a tractable benchmark for evaluating detection performance.

Method: Develops a unified CRB framework by relaxing binary activity states to continuous parameters, derives closed-form CRB expressions for covariance-oriented and coherent detection models, and uses random matrix theory for single-antenna FAS coherent CRB analysis.

Result: Closed-form CRB expressions obtained for both detection formulations; CRB-based analysis provides informative benchmark; FAS systems deliver strong spatial-diversity gains with significantly reduced complexity compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: The CRB framework offers a tractable and informative benchmark for activity detection evaluation across architectures, and FAS systems demonstrate superior performance with reduced complexity through spatial-diversity gains.

Abstract: In this letter, we develop a unified Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) framework to characterize the fundamental performance limits of transmission activity detection in fluid antenna systems (FASs) and conventional multiple fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To facilitate CRB analysis applicable to activity indicators, we relax the binary activity states to continuous parameters, thereby aligning the bound-based evaluation with practical threshold-based detection decisions. Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory. The results demonstrate that CRB-based analysis provides a tractable and informative benchmark for evaluating activity detection across architectures and detection schemes, and further reveal that FASs can deliver strong spatial-diversity gains with significantly reduced complexity.

*Shih-Kai Chou,Maice Costa,Mihael Mohorčič,Jernej Hribar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a carbon-aware Age of Information framework that jointly optimizes information freshness and environmental impact, showing that minimizing AoI doesn't inherently minimize carbon footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Age of Information (AoI) metrics focus on information freshness but ignore the environmental impact of frequent transmissions, specifically carbon footprint. There's a need to address this gap for sustainable monitoring and control in data-driven infrastructures.

Method: Developed a carbon-aware AoI framework with closed-form expressions for average AoI under constrained carbon footprint budgets for M/M/1 and M/M/1* queuing models. Extended analysis to dynamic, time-varying Carbon Intensity and solved the AoI minimization problem.

Result: Minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize carbon footprint, revealing a trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. Carbon Intensity variability affects achievable AoI, requiring joint optimization of carbon footprint budgets, SNR, and transmission scheduling.

Conclusion: Sustainable operation in next-generation networks requires carbon-aware information freshness optimization that balances information timeliness with environmental impact through joint optimization of multiple parameters.

Abstract: The timeliness of collected information is essential for monitoring and control in data-driven intelligent infrastructures. It is typically quantified using the Age of Information (AoI) metric, which has been widely adopted to capture the freshness of information received in the form of status updates. While AoI-based metrics quantify how timely the collected information is, they largely overlook the environmental impact associated with frequent transmissions, specifically, the resulting Carbon Footprint (CF). To address this gap, we introduce a carbon-aware AoI framework. We first derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI under constrained CF budgets for the baseline $M/M/1$ and $M/M/1^*$ queuing models, assuming fixed Carbon Intensity (CI). We then extend the analysis by treating CI as a dynamic, time-varying parameter and solve the AoI minimization problem. Our results show that minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize CF, highlighting a clear trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. CI variability further affects achievable AoI, indicating that sustainable operation requires joint optimization of CF budgets, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and transmission scheduling. This work lays the foundation for carbon-aware information freshness optimization in next-generation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA data storage offers high-density, long-term solution for exponential digital data growth. Composite DNA (using nucleotide mixtures) increases storage capacity beyond standard 4 bases, but faces errors from sampling randomness and channel impairments.

Method: Model composite DNA storage as multinomial channel, represent composite letters on 3D probability simplex. Derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point. Employ practical channel codes (LDPC) for error correction. Extend framework to substitution and insertion-deletion channels with constellation update rules.

Result: Approach achieves reliable performance with existing LDPC codes. Outperforms prior schemes designed for limited-magnitude probability errors, which degrade significantly under sampling randomness.

Conclusion: Composite DNA storage can be effectively modeled and corrected using multinomial channel framework with practical error correction codes, enabling reliable storage despite sampling randomness and channel impairments.

Abstract: DNA data storage offers a high-density, long-term alternative to traditional storage systems, addressing the exponential growth of digital data. Composite DNA extends this paradigm by leveraging mixtures of nucleotides to increase storage capacity beyond the four standard bases. In this work, we model composite DNA storage as a multinomial channel and draw an analogy to digital modulation by representing composite letters on the three-dimensional probability simplex. To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction. We then extend this framework to substitution and insertion-deletion (ID) channels, proposing constellation update rules that account for these additional impairments. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable performance with existing LDPC codes, compared to the prior schemes designed for limited-magnitude probability errors, whose performance degrades significantly under sampling randomness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the achievable performance of dirty paper coding for Gaussian broadcast channels under practical finite blocklength constraints, addressing the gap between asymptotic capacity results and real-world finite-length implementations.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Broadcast adaptation of dependence testing bound (Polyanskiy et al. 2010) providing upper bound on average error probability with channel dispersion terms; 2) κβ lower bounds on maximal code sizes for each user using dirty paper coding.

Result: Proposed two novel achievability bounds for finite blocklength dirty paper coding in Gaussian broadcast channels, including error probability bounds with dispersion terms and code size lower bounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the achievable performance of dirty paper coding for the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) with finite blocklength and we propose two different achievability bounds for this problem. We present the broadcast adaptation of dependence testing bound of Polyanskiy et al. 2010, which is an upper bound on the average error probability that depends on the channel dispersion terms of each error event for fixed input. Additionally, we introduce the $κβ$ lower bounds on the maximal code sizes of each user using dirty paper coding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic identification (DI) can substantially enhance communication efficiency, and the linear Gaussian model underlies many physical communication systems, making this analysis both theoretically and practically relevant for future network performance evaluation.

Method: Extends recent analysis of rate-reliability tradeoff in DI to general linear Gaussian channels, marking the first such analysis for channels with continuous output.

Result: Provides theoretical insights into DI performance in Gaussian channels and suggests that similar rate-reliability behavior may extend to wider classes of continuous channels based on structural parallels observed between Gaussian and discrete-output cases.

Conclusion: The analysis bridges discrete and continuous channel theory for DI, offering practical relevance for evaluating DI performance in future networks while suggesting broader applicability to continuous channel classes.

Abstract: We extend the recent analysis of the rate-reliability tradeoff in deterministic identification (DI) to general linear Gaussian channels, marking the first such analysis for channels with continuous output. Because DI provides a framework that can substantially enhance communication efficiency, and since the linear Gaussian model underlies a broad range of physical communication systems, our results offer both theoretical insights and practical relevance for the performance evaluation of DI in future networks. Moreover, the structural parallels observed between the Gaussian and discrete-output cases suggest that similar rate-reliability behaviour may extend to wider classes of continuous channels.

*Xiang Zhang,Giuseppe Caire,Mingyue Ji*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Novel packet type-based framework reduces subpacketization in D2D coded caching while maintaining optimal communication rates, using asymmetry through user grouping and systematic exploitation in cache placement/delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite-length analysis is critical for practical deployment of coded caching. Subpacketization levels are a key bottleneck in finite-length settings, so reducing them while maintaining optimal communication rates is essential.

Method: Packet type-based design framework that introduces asymmetry through user grouping and systematically exploits this asymmetry in cache placement and multicast delivery. Uses two reduction gains: subfile saving gain (eliminating certain subfiles) and further splitting saving gain (reducing splitting granularity). Formulates caching scheme design as an integer linear program (ILP).

Result: Achieves overall subpacketization improvement over the original Ji-Caire-Molisch (JCM) caching scheme and various state-of-the-art schemes while preserving optimal communication rates.

Conclusion: The PT framework provides a systematic approach to design rate-optimal D2D coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization, addressing a key practical bottleneck for finite-length deployment.

Abstract: Finite-length analysis is critical for bringing coded caching closer to practical deployment. In this work, we study the design of communication rate-optimal device-to-device (D2D) coded caching schemes with minimal subpacketization levels, a key bottleneck in finite-length settings. We present a novel \tit{packet type-based} (PT) design framework that (i) strategically introduces \tit{asymmetry} into file splitting through user grouping, and (ii) systematically exploits such asymmetry in both cache placement and multicast delivery to create subpacketization reduction opportunities. In particular, the induced asymmetry gives rise to two fundamental forms of subpacketization reduction gains: the \emph{subfile saving gain}, achieved by eliminating certain types of subfiles through careful user grouping and transmitter selection, and the \emph{further splitting saving gain}, attained by reducing the splitting granularity for the remaining subfiles. The combined effect of these two reduction gains yields an overall subpacketization improvement over the original Ji-Caire-Molisch (JCM) caching scheme~\cite{ji2016fundamental}, as well as various state-of-the-art schemes, while preserving optimal communication rates.
  Under the PT framework, we formulate the caching scheme design as an integer linear program (ILP), where each feasible solution corresponds to a valid rate-optimal D2D coded caching scheme with potentially reduced subpacketization relative to the JCM baseline.

*Irtiza Hasan,Ahmed Arafa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Optimal transmission scheduling for gossiping receivers to minimize AoI and transmission cost, with threshold-based policy structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gossiping enables decentralized information exchange but may communicate stale information, requiring transmitter intervention. Need to balance freshness (AoI) with transmission costs in networks with unreliable links.

Method: Formulated as average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) with time-slotted setting. Used Relative Value Iteration (RVI) to evaluate optimal policy. Proved structural properties showing age-difference threshold structure.

Result: Optimal policy has threshold structure: direct transmission only when minimum AoI is large enough AND age difference below threshold. Otherwise transmitter idles to leverage gossiping. Numerical evaluations show superiority over baselines.

Conclusion: First step toward characterizing optimal freshness-transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks. Shows when to rely on gossiping vs. direct transmission based on age conditions.

Abstract: We study the optimal transmission and scheduling policy for a transmitter (source) communicating with two gossiping receivers aiming at tracking the source's status over time using the age of information (AoI) metric. Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks.

TL;DR: First CU block-level steganalysis method for H.265/HEVC using structure gradients and IPM mapping with Transformer network, achieving superior detection across multiple steganographic algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing H.265/HEVC steganalysis focuses on motion vectors, intra prediction modes, or transform coefficients, but lacks analysis at coding-structure level. CU partition structure exhibits steganographic perturbations that are difficult to characterize with traditional features.

Method: Proposes CU block-structure gradient map to describe coding-unit partitioning changes, combined with block-level mapping of intra prediction modes. Designs Transformer network (GradIPMFormer) specifically for CU-block steganalysis.

Result: Method consistently achieves superior detection performance across multiple H.265/HEVC steganographic algorithms under different quantization parameters and resolution settings.

Conclusion: Provides new CU block-level analysis paradigm for H.265/HEVC video steganalysis with significant value for covert communication security detection, validating feasibility of coding-structure perspective approach.

Abstract: Existing H.265/HEVC video steganalysis research mainly focuses on statistical feature modeling at the levels of motion vectors (MV), intra prediction modes (IPM), or transform coefficients. In contrast, studies targeting the coding-structure level - especially the analysis of block-level steganographic behaviors in Coding Units (CUs) - remain at an early stage. As a core component of H.265/HEVC coding decisions, the CU partition structure often exhibits steganographic perturbations in the form of structural changes and reorganization of prediction relationships, which are difficult to characterize effectively using traditional pixel-domain features or mode statistics. To address this issue, this paper, for the first time from the perspective of CU block-level steganalysis, proposes an H.265/HEVC video steganalysis method based on CU block-structure gradients and intra prediction mode mapping. The proposed method constructs a CU block-structure gradient map to explicitly describe changes in coding-unit partitioning, and combines it with a block-level mapping representation of IPM to jointly model the structural perturbations introduced by CU-level steganographic embedding. On this basis, we design a Transformer network, GradIPMFormer, tailored for CU-block steganalysis, thereby effectively enhancing the capability to perceive CU-level steganographic behaviors. Experimental results show that under different quantization parameters and resolution settings, the proposed method consistently achieves superior detection performance across multiple H.265/HEVC steganographic algorithms, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of conducting video steganalysis from the coding-structure perspective. This study provides a new CU block-level analysis paradigm for H.265/HEVC video steganalysis and has significant research value for covert communication security detection.

Conclusion: BSoNet addresses the fundamental limitations of portable backscatter imaging by using deep learning to overcome photon count limitations, making these systems more practical and reliable for security protection applications.

Abstract: Portable backscatter imaging systems (PBI) integrate an X-ray source and detector in a single unit, utilizing Compton scattering photons to rapidly acquire superficial or shallow structural information of an inspected object through single-sided imaging. The application of this technology overcomes the limitations of traditional transmission X-ray detection, offering greater flexibility and portability, making it the preferred tool for the rapid and accurate identification of potential threats in scenarios such as borders, ports, and industrial nondestructive security inspections. However, the image quality is significantly compromised due to the limited number of Compton backscattered photons. The insufficient photon counts result primarily from photon absorption in materials, the pencil-beam scanning design, and short signal sampling times. It therefore yields severe image noise and an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio, greatly reducing the accuracy and reliability of PBI systems. To address these challenges, this paper introduces BSoNet, a novel deep learning-based approach specifically designed to optimize the image quality of PBI systems. The approach significantly enhances image clarity, recognition, and contrast while meeting practical application requirements. It transforms PBI systems into more effective and reliable inspection tools, contributing significantly to strengthening security protection.

*Ayush Varshney,Katherine L. Bouman,Berthy T. Feng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Amortized variational inference with spatially adaptive perturbations improves diffusion-based image reconstruction, achieving competitive performance without iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative priors for ill-posed imaging inverse problems are computationally intensive (requiring iterative sampling or per-instance optimization), while amortized variational inference frameworks, though faster, struggle with fine details and complex textures.

Method: Extend amortized variational inference by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions.

Result: Superior or competitive performance to previous diffusion-based approaches on deblurring and super-resolution tasks, delivering more realistic reconstructions without the computational cost of iterative refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of both iterative diffusion approaches and standard amortized inference, providing high-quality reconstructions with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ill-posed imaging inverse problems remain challenging due to the ambiguity in mapping degraded observations to clean images. Diffusion-based generative priors have recently shown promise, but typically rely on computationally intensive iterative sampling or per-instance optimization. Amortized variational inference frameworks address this inefficiency by learning a direct mapping from measurements to posteriors, enabling fast posterior sampling without requiring the optimization of a new posterior for every new set of measurements. However, they still struggle to reconstruct fine details and complex textures. To address this, we extend the amortized framework by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions. Experiments on deblurring and super-resolution demonstrate that our method achieves superior or competitive performance to previous diffusion-based approaches, delivering more realistic reconstructions without the computational cost of iterative refinement.

TL;DR: A framework reconstructs time-resolved 3D aortic geometries from limited 2D cine MRI slices using a statistical shape model and differentiable mesh optimization, achieving accurate results with as few as six slices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient patient-specific 3D aortic shape reconstruction from standard 2D cine MRI acquisitions, which are more clinically accessible than complex 4D flow MRI but provide limited spatial information.

Method: Combines a statistical shape model built from retrospective data with differentiable volumetric mesh optimization. Uses optimized 2D slice placements along the aortic arch, manual segmentation of cine MRI slices, and generates time-resolved models for shape feature extraction.

Result: Achieved accurate reconstructions with Dice score 89.9±1.6%, IoU 81.7±2.7%, Hausdorff distance 7.3±3.3mm, Chamfer distance 3.7±0.6mm, and mean absolute radius error 0.8±0.6mm compared to 4D flow MRI. Showed significant age-related differences in shape features and radial strain.

Conclusion: The method efficiently extracts time-resolved 3D aortic meshes from limited 2D cine MRI, enabling computational shape and strain analysis in clinical settings where 4D flow MRI is unavailable.

Abstract: Background and Objective: We propose a shape reconstruction framework to generate time-resolved, patient-specific 3D aortic geometries from a limited number of standard cine 2D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. A statistical shape model of the aorta is coupled with differentiable volumetric mesh optimization to obtain personalized aortic meshes.
  Methods: The statistical shape model was constructed from retrospective data and optimized 2D slice placements along the aortic arch were identified. Cine 2D MRI slices were then acquired in 30 subjects (19 volunteers, 11 aortic stenosis patients). After manual segmentation, time-resolved aortic models were generated via differentiable volumetric mesh optimization to derive vessel shape features, centerline parameters, and radial wall strain. In 10 subjects, additional 4D flow MRI was acquired to compare peak-systolic shapes.
  Results: Anatomically accurate aortic geometries were obtained from as few as six cine 2D MRI slices, achieving a mean +/- standard deviation Dice score of (89.9 +/- 1.6) %, Intersection over Union of (81.7 +/- 2.7) %, Hausdorff distance of (7.3 +/- 3.3) mm, and Chamfer distance of (3.7 +/- 0.6) mm relative to 4D flow MRI. The mean absolute radius error was (0.8 +/- 0.6) mm. Significant age-related differences were observed for all shape features, including radial strain, which decreased progressively ((11.00 +/- 3.11) x 10-2 vs. (3.74 +/- 1.25) x 10-2 vs. (2.89 +/- 0.87) x 10-2 for young, mid-age, and elderly groups).
  Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient extraction of time-resolved 3D aortic meshes from limited sets of standard cine 2D MRI acquisitions, suitable for computational shape and strain analysis.

*Bingxu Xie,Fang Zhou,Jincan Wu,Yonghui Liu,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First unsupervised progressive domain adaptation framework for no-reference point cloud quality assessment that addresses cross-domain performance degradation through coarse-to-fine alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-PCQA models suffer significant performance degradation when there's a distribution gap between training (source) and testing (target) domains, but limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment: 1) Coarse-grained stage uses discrepancy-aware alignment with quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss to capture relative quality relationships; 2) Fine-grained stage uses perception fusion with symmetric feature fusion and conditional discriminator to identify domain-invariant features and selectively enhance quality-relevant feature transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that UPDA effectively enhances NR-PCQA performance in cross-domain scenarios, validating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed UPDA framework successfully addresses domain shift challenges in NR-PCQA through progressive domain adaptation, making NR-PCQA models more robust across different domains.

Abstract: While no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) approaches have achieved significant progress over the past decade, their performance often degrades substantially when a distribution gap exists between the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) data. However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains. To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm to address domain shifts. At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-aware coarse-grained alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a novel quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. At the fine-grained stage, a perception fusion fine-grained alignment approach with symmetric feature fusion is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances the transfer of quality-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability.

*Weiting Liu,Han Wu,Yufei Kuang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Jianfeng Feng,Wenlian Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIND: Error-driven learning framework for automated optimization modeling via LLMs that addresses data scarcity and sparse rewards through localized error patterns and dynamic fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated optimization modeling approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) sparsity of error-specific problems in training data, and (2) sparse rewards for difficult problems, leading to suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs.

Method: Proposes MIND framework with two key components: 1) Construction of focused, high-density training corpus leveraging localized error patterns in optimization modeling, and 2) Dynamic Supervised Fine-Tuning Policy Optimization (DFPO) for tackling difficult problems through localized refinement rather than holistic reasoning.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The error-driven learning framework MIND effectively addresses data scarcity and sparse reward challenges in automated optimization modeling by leveraging localized error patterns, leading to superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Automated optimization modeling via Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to assist complex human decision-making. While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\textbf{m}ated opt\textbf{i}mization modeli\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \textbf{F}ine-Tuning \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

*Zukang Xu,Zhixiong Zhao,Xing Hu,Zhixuan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KBVQ-MoE: A novel vector quantization framework for Mixture of Experts models that addresses redundancy and bias issues to enable efficient 3-bit quantization with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models are computationally efficient but have huge parameter sizes making deployment difficult on resource-constrained devices. Direct VQ quantization causes performance degradation due to redundant expert representations and cumulative output bias.

Method: Two key techniques: 1) Input-driven redundancy elimination using KLT-guided SVD to extract and share dominant weight components across experts, 2) Bias-corrected output stabilization applying VQ only to expert-specific representations with channel-wise affine compensation.

Result: KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing methods. 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves 67.99 average accuracy vs 68.07 FP16 baseline, demonstrating near-lossless compression.

Conclusion: KBVQ-MoE enables efficient deployment of MoE-based LLMs on edge devices through ultra-low-bit quantization while maintaining near-original performance, addressing critical redundancy and bias issues in MoE quantization.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectra optimizer addresses gradient anisotropy in LLM training by suppressing dominant spike subspace without amplifying noise-sensitive tail, achieving faster convergence and reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM training gradients are highly anisotropic with a small set of dominant spectral directions (spike) containing recurrent linguistic structure, while context-specific information resides in a long tail. This spike-tail separation suppresses tail learning through second moment normalization and tightens learning rate bounds.

Method: Proposes Spectra, a spike-aware optimizer that tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm-started power iteration and applies low-rank spectral shaping. It suppresses the dominant low-rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise-sensitive spectral tail, with negligible overhead and reduced optimizer state memory.

Result: On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens: 30% faster convergence than AdamW, 0.7% reduced per-step overhead, 49.25% cut in optimizer state memory, 1.62% improvement in average downstream accuracy. Compared to Muon: 5.1x faster optimizer processing time, lower final loss, 0.66% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: Spectra effectively addresses gradient anisotropy in LLM training by selectively suppressing the dominant spike subspace, leading to faster convergence, reduced memory usage, and improved downstream performance compared to existing optimizers.

Abstract: Gradient signals in LLM training are highly anisotropic: recurrent linguistic structure concentrates energy into a small set of dominant spectral directions, while context specific information resides in a long tail. We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, Spectra is 5.1x faster in optimizer processing time, achieves a lower final loss, and improves average accuracy by 0.66%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAC-KAN: A lightweight framework for GNSS signal protection in GenAI-powered consumer electronics, combining physics-guided simulation for data generation and an efficient MS-GAC backbone with KAN decision head to achieve high accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI applications in consumer electronics consume most computational resources, leaving limited capacity for essential security tasks like GNSS signal protection. Additionally, training robust classifiers is hindered by scarcity of real-world interference data.

Method: 1) Physics-guided simulation to synthesize large-scale jamming dataset; 2) Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone combining Asymmetric Convolution Blocks and Ghost modules for efficient feature extraction; 3) Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with learnable spline activations replacing traditional MLP decision head.

Result: Achieves 98.0% overall accuracy with only 0.13 million parameters (660× fewer than Vision Transformer baselines), making it suitable as an "always-on" security companion without competing with primary GenAI tasks.

Conclusion: GAC-KAN successfully addresses data scarcity and efficiency challenges in the GenAI era, providing a lightweight solution for GNSS signal protection that can coexist with resource-intensive GenAI applications on edge hardware.

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into Consumer Electronics (CE)--from AI-powered assistants in wearables to generative planning in autonomous Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)--has revolutionized user experiences. However, these GenAI applications impose immense computational burdens on edge hardware, leaving strictly limited resources for fundamental security tasks like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal protection. Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. This extreme lightweight characteristic makes GAC-KAN an ideal "always-on" security companion, ensuring GNSS reliability without contending for the computational resources required by primary GenAI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chiplet placement methods focus on minimizing wirelength or use weighted sum approaches for multi-objective optimization, which fail to handle the inherent conflict between wirelength reduction and thermal management in practical 2.5D integrated circuits.

Method: Proposes TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). The approach assigns conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each with distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm.

Result: Experimental results show TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent RL framework effectively addresses the conflicting objectives in chiplet placement, providing superior trade-offs between wirelength and thermal management compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The rapid growth of electronics has accelerated the adoption of 2.5D integrated circuits, where effective automated chiplet placement is essential as systems scale to larger and more heterogeneous chiplet assemblies. Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods embed each time step as independent tokens, which destroys multi-offset temporal correlation - the fine-grained dependencies across different time steps that are crucial in regular Web data. This creates a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences.

Method: 1) Proposes MOTE (Multi-Offset Time Embedding) method to mitigate performance degradation from standard token embedding, guided by an upper bound on approximate reconstruction performance. 2) Designs Time-TK architecture with Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn temporal patterns among offset sub-sequences, and Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to capture complex dependencies between sub-sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets (including traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput) show Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MOTE embedding method and Time-TK architecture effectively address the information bottleneck in time series forecasting by preserving multi-offset temporal correlations, making them universal building blocks that can be integrated into various existing models for improved forecasting performance on Web data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for the World Wide Web and represents a core technical challenge in ensuring the stable and efficient operation of modern web services, such as intelligent transportation and website throughput. However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets, covering domains such as traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput, demonstrate that Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.

TL;DR: MELINOE fine-tunes MoE models to prefer activating fewer experts per sequence, enabling GPU caching of preferred experts to reduce I/O overhead and improve inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models reduce activated parameters per token but still require loading all parameters into GPU memory, creating memory bottlenecks in resource-constrained settings. Existing CPU offloading solutions suffer from significant I/O latency from expert transfers.

Method: Fine-tunes MoE models to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence, then caches these preferred experts in GPU memory to reduce expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead.

Result: Increases throughput by 1.2-3× over efficient baselines and up to 14.7× over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving model performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MELINOE provides a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency by reducing I/O bottlenecks through expert preference tuning and GPU caching.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model architectures can significantly reduce the number of activated parameters per token, enabling computationally efficient training and inference. However, their large overall parameter counts and model sizes have precluded their widespread usage in resource-constrained settings as all of the parameters must still be loaded into GPU memory. Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency.

### [150] [Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11194)
*Mahta Movasat,Ingrid Tomac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML models predict post-wildfire debris flow onset using lab experiments, finding fine sand most vulnerable to erosion during initial high-intensity rainfall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to soil hydrophobicity from wildfires, leading to catastrophic debris flows that differ from natural mudflows. Understanding timing and conditions of debris-flow onset is crucial for hazard assessment and emergency planning.

Method: Applied multiple ML algorithms (MLR, logistic regression, SVC, K-means clustering, PCA) to predict outcomes from laboratory experiments modeling field conditions using rain devices on various soils in sloped flumes. Analyzed coupled effects of rain intensity, slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes.

Result: MLR effectively predicted total discharge but erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes. Sensitivity analysis revealed fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. First 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure.

Conclusion: ML techniques show strong potential for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning by modeling complex debris flow systems without predefined assumptions, particularly for predicting critical onset conditions.

Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure.

### [152] [Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense for Pre-Trained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11204)
*Zhuxin Lei,Ziyuan Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZePAD is a dual-branch defense method that provides persistent robustness against downstream-agnostic adversarial examples for SSL encoders without sacrificing benign performance, requiring only single tuning for diverse downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public SSL encoders are vulnerable to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs). Existing defenses use task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which limits generalizability, causes catastrophic forgetting, and deteriorates benign performance. A more rigorous defense is needed that requires only single tuning for diverse tasks while preserving benign performance.

Method: ZePAD uses a dual-branch structure: 1) Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) with two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance, and 2) Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness doesn't compromise benign performance. The method can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence without adversarial example identification tasks during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets show effectiveness. In certain cases, achieves 29.20% improvement in benign performance and 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, demonstrating zero-sacrifice property. Enables single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ZePAD provides a practical solution for defending SSL encoders against downstream-agnostic adversarial examples with persistent robustness, requiring only single tuning while preserving benign performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.

TL;DR: UltraLIF replaces heuristic surrogate gradients in SNNs with ultradiscretization from tropical geometry, providing principled differentiable models of spiking neurons with theoretical guarantees and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient and biologically plausible but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, forcing reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients that lack theoretical foundations and cause forward-backward mismatch during training.

Method: Introduces UltraLIF framework using ultradiscretization from tropical geometry, where max-plus semiring models neural threshold dynamics via log-sum-exp as differentiable soft-maximum converging to hard thresholding. Derives two neuron models: UltraLIF from LIF ODE (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from diffusion equation (spatial dynamics for gap junction coupling). Both are fully differentiable and trainable via standard backpropagation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks (static images, neuromorphic vision, audio) demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, especially in single-timestep (T=1) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. Optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: UltraLIF provides a principled mathematical foundation for training SNNs, eliminating heuristic surrogate gradients while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical performance advantages, particularly for energy-efficient single-timestep inference on temporal data.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\eps \to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: APT is a novel neural operator for subsurface simulations that combines graph-based local feature extraction with global attention, achieving SOTA performance on regular/irregular grids with super-resolution and adaptive mesh refinement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subsurface systems are crucial for energy resources and CO2 sequestration, but full physics simulations are computationally expensive due to geological heterogeneity, high resolution requirements, and coupled physical processes with different time scales.

Method: APT (Adaptive Physics Transformer) is a geometry-, mesh-, and physics-agnostic neural operator that fuses a graph-based encoder for local heterogeneous features with a global attention mechanism for long-range physical impacts.

Result: APT outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in subsurface tasks across both regular and irregular grids, demonstrates robust super-resolution capabilities, is the first to learn directly from adaptive mesh refinement simulations, and shows cross-dataset learning potential.

Conclusion: APT is positioned as a robust and scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface foundation model development, addressing key computational challenges in subsurface simulations.

Abstract: The Earth's subsurface is a cornerstone of modern society, providing essential energy resources like hydrocarbons, geothermal, and minerals while serving as the primary reservoir for $CO_2$ sequestration. However, full physics numerical simulations of these systems are notoriously computationally expensive due to geological heterogeneity, high resolution requirements, and the tight coupling of physical processes with distinct propagation time scales. Here we propose the \textbf{Adaptive Physics Transformer} (APT), a geometry-, mesh-, and physics-agnostic neural operator that explicitly addresses these challenges. APT fuses a graph-based encoder to extract high-resolution local heterogeneous features with a global attention mechanism to resolve long-range physical impacts. Our results demonstrate that APT outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in subsurface tasks across both regular and irregular grids with robust super-resolution capabilities. Notably, APT is the first architecture that directly learns from adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We also demonstrate APT's capability for cross-dataset learning, positioning it as a robust and scalable backbone for large-scale subsurface foundation model development.

*Yunchong Song,Jushi Kai,Liming Lu,Kaixi Qiu,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Elastic Memory is a novel memory architecture for Transformers that uses HiPPO framework for online compression of historical sequences, enabling efficient long-context processing without quadratic attention bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face quadratic attention bottlenecks when scaling to long contexts, and existing recurrent memory approaches struggle with trade-offs between theoretical principles and practical scalability.

Method: Elastic Memory treats historical sequences as continuous signals, applies optimal online compression via HiPPO framework to encode them into fixed-size memory states, and uses polynomial sampling for flexible retrieval of history summaries.

Result: Outperformed baselines on 32k+ context datasets across three domains; beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory efficiency; outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes even when Melodi had 30% more parameters; significantly faster than Melodi at 4x model size.

Conclusion: Elastic Memory provides an effective solution for long-context processing with decoupled design that allows test-time inductive bias injection, offering superior performance and scalability compared to existing memory approaches.

Abstract: Transformers face a quadratic bottleneck in attention when scaling to long contexts. Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance.

### [156] [How Many Features Can a Language Model Store Under the Linear Representation Hypothesis?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11246)
*Nikhil Garg,Jon Kleinberg,Kenny Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes theoretical bounds for linear compressed sensing, showing that linear accessibility requires significantly more neurons (Ω(k²/log k)) than classical compressed sensing (O(k log(m/k))) to represent and access features, confirming that linear decoding is a stronger requirement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mathematical framework for the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) in language models, which posits that intermediate layers store features linearly. The paper aims to quantify how many neurons are needed to both represent features linearly and access them with linear decoders, addressing the gap between classical compressed sensing (non-linear decoding) and linear compressed sensing.

Method: Separates LRH into two claims: linear representation (features embedded linearly in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). Uses theoretical analysis to establish upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. Upper bound proof uses random matrix constructions with approximately orthogonal columns. Lower bound proof combines rank bounds for near-identity matrices with Turán's theorem for clique-free graphs.

Result: Proves that d = Ω_ε(k²/log k log(m/k)) neurons are required for linear compressed sensing, while d = O_ε(k² log m) suffice. This shows a quantitative gap between classical compressed sensing (O(k log(m/k))) and linear compressed sensing, demonstrating that linear accessibility is meaningfully stronger than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms neurons can store exponential features under LRH, supporting the superposition hypothesis.

Conclusion: Linear accessibility imposes significantly stronger requirements than linear representation alone, requiring roughly quadratic rather than linear scaling in sparsity k. The results provide theoretical evidence for the superposition hypothesis while establishing fundamental limits on linear feature decoding in neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which asserts that intermediate layers of language models store features linearly. We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.
  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the "superposition hypothesis" (Elhage et al., 2022).
  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well in single scientific domains, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts are poorly understood, despite the promise of improved generalization and cross-domain knowledge synergy.

Method: Systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning using a five-discipline corpus, analyzing learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions.

Result: Multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training. The study distilled four consistent empirical laws that form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The four laws provide actionable guidance for developing generalizable scientific LLMs through principled multi-discipline fine-tuning, with asymmetric LoRA-MoE yielding robust gains with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance through fine-tuning within individual scientific domains, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts remains poorly understood, despite the promise of improved generalization and broader applicability through cross-domain knowledge synergy. In this work, we present the first systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning, constructing a five-discipline corpus and analyzing learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions. Particularly, our study shows that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training and distills four consistent empirical laws: (1) Balance-then-Diversity: low-resource disciplines degrade performance unless mitigated via diversity-aware upsampling; (2) Merge-then-Align: restoring instruction-following ability is critical for cross-discipline synergy; (3) Optimize-then-Scale: parameter scaling offers limited gains without prior design optimization; and (4) Share-then-Specialize: asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains with minimal trainable parameters via shared low-rank projection. Together, these laws form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning and provide actionable guidance for developing generalizable scientific LLMs.

TL;DR: PLaTITO improves transferable implicit transfer operators for molecular dynamics by incorporating auxiliary information like protein language model embeddings, achieving better data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization for protein systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally expensive for generating independent samples, while existing generative MD methods (GenMD) lack transferability across molecular systems. The paper aims to improve data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics.

Method: Developed PLaTITO approach that incorporates auxiliary information sources including protein language model (pLM) embeddings, structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings to enhance TITO models. Compared coarse-grained TITO models with Boltzmann Emulators and studied impact of different conditioning signals.

Result: Coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators. Incorporating pLM embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. PLaTITO achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins.

Conclusion: Auxiliary information sources can significantly improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators for molecular dynamics, with PLaTITO demonstrating superior performance for out-of-distribution protein systems.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning is fundamental for efficient model development and data curation, as it helps optimize training pipelines and resource allocation.

Method: The authors use correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales, examining four core research questions about transfer dynamics.

Result: Transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales, with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct and sometimes opposing scaling dynamics. Some benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors while others are unreliable.

Conclusion: The findings reveal complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development.

Abstract: Understanding how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to efficient model development and data curation. In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development.

*Tanmoy Mukherjee,Marius Kloft,Pierre Marquis,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a credal-set approach to separate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty using distinct geometric properties, implemented via a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with disjoint uncertainty heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods estimate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty from the same predictive distribution, leading to strong correlation between them that blurs their semantic distinction, which is problematic for reliable decision making.

Method: A credal-set formulation where uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, with epistemic uncertainty corresponding to set size and aleatoric uncertainty to noise within elements. This is instantiated in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by separate objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths.

Result: The approach reduces correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

Conclusion: The credal-set formulation provides a principled way to achieve separation of uncertainty types by construction rather than post hoc decomposition, enabling more reliable uncertainty quantification for decision making.

Abstract: Decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data ambiguity) components is central to reliable decision making, yet most methods estimate both from the same predictive distribution. Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

*Jiacheng Wang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Zirong Chen,Keren Liao,Zhongbin Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based data rewriting agent learns to rewrite downstream training data to match LLM's natural QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity, reducing catastrophic forgetting during SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT causes catastrophic forgetting when downstream data has substantial distribution shift from LLM's prior training. Existing data rewriting methods produce rewrites misaligned with model's natural QA-style generation and suffer from diversity collapse due to fixed templates.

Method: Cast data rewriting as policy learning problem using RL. Learn rewriting policy that matches backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Optimize rewrite distribution under reward feedback with hard task-consistency gate.

Result: Achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

Conclusion: RL-based data rewriting agent constructs higher-quality rewritten datasets for downstream SFT, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining task performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress, yet adapting them to downstream scenarios still commonly relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

TL;DR: TopoGBM: A topological regularization framework for Glioblastoma prognosis that captures tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness in MRI analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma prognosis using deep learning is hindered by extreme spatial heterogeneity and inconsistent MRI protocols across institutions, leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site generalization.

Method: 3D convolutional autoencoder with topological regularization that preserves complex, non-Euclidean invariants of tumor manifolds within a compressed latent space, explicitly modeling high-variance structural signatures.

Result: Achieves C-index 0.67 (test) and 0.58 (validation), outperforming baselines under domain shift; reconstruction errors localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones (0.03 test, 0.09 validation); 50% of prognostic signal attributed to tumor and peritumoral microenvironment.

Conclusion: Topological priors enable learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness, demonstrating clinical reliability of the unsupervised approach.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.

Conclusion: The AI-CDSS shows potential as a useful tool for accurately identifying type 2 diabetes, particularly in settings where diabetes specialists are not readily available, outperforming non-specialist physicians.

Abstract: Identifying type 2 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, particularly for primary care physicians. Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. To generate predictions, the algorithm utilized key features such as body mass index, plasma fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate. These findings indicate that the AI-CDSS has the potential to be a useful tool for accurately identifying type 2 diabetes, especially in situations in which diabetes specialists are not readily available.

### [164] [Evaluating Memory Structure in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11243)
*Alina Shutova,Alexandra Olenina,Ivan Vinogradov,Anton Sinitsin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructMemEval benchmark tests LLM agents' ability to organize long-term memory in structured formats (ledgers, to-do lists, trees) rather than just factual recall, revealing limitations in current LLMs' structural memory organization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-term memory benchmarks focus too narrowly on simple fact retention and recall, which can be solved with basic retrieval-augmented LLMs. There's a need to test more complex memory organization capabilities that reflect how humans structure knowledge.

Method: Proposed StructMemEval benchmark with tasks requiring specific memory structures: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees, etc. Tested simple retrieval-augmented LLMs vs. memory agents with explicit organization prompts.

Result: Simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with structured memory tasks. Memory agents can solve them when prompted about organization, but modern LLMs often fail to recognize memory structures without explicit prompting.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack inherent ability to organize memory structurally, highlighting need for improvements in both LLM training and memory framework design to enable more sophisticated memory organization.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based agents and chat assistants rely on long-term memory frameworks to store reusable knowledge, recall user preferences, and augment reasoning. As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiFloat4 (HiF4) is a new 4-bit block floating-point format for deep learning that packs 64 elements with shared scaling metadata, achieving 4.5 bits per value and enabling efficient matrix multiplication with better accuracy than existing formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-precision formats for deep learning face challenges in balancing accuracy, hardware efficiency, and dynamic range representation. There's a need for a format that can maintain high accuracy while enabling efficient hardware implementation for matrix operations.

Method: HiF4 uses a block floating-point format where each 64-element block shares 32 bits of scaling metadata. It implements a three-level scaling hierarchy to capture both inter-group and intra-group dynamic range, improving utilization of the representational space. The large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner.

Result: HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple language models (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1, LongCat) and diverse downstream tasks. The format also enables significant reductions in hardware area and power consumption.

Conclusion: HiFloat4 presents an effective 4-bit block floating-point format that balances accuracy and hardware efficiency for deep learning inference, outperforming existing state-of-the-art formats while enabling more efficient hardware implementations.

Abstract: This paper introduces HiFloat4 (HiF4), a block floating-point data format tailored for deep learning. Each HiF4 unit packs 64 4-bit elements with 32 bits of shared scaling metadata, averaging 4.5 bits per value. The metadata specifies a three-level scaling hierarchy, capturing inter- and intra-group dynamic range while improving the utilization of the representational space. In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.

### [166] [Efficient Analysis of the Distilled Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11320)
*Jamie Mahowald,Brian Bell,Alex Ho,Michael Geyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTK computation is expensive due to large Jacobians; dataset distillation reduces data dimension, enabling 20-100× reduction in Jacobian calculations while preserving kernel structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally expensive because they require evaluating large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches use projection and sketching techniques, but there's a need for more efficient methods to reduce computational complexity.

Method: Propose NTK-tuned dataset distillation to compress the data dimension itself, showing that the neural tangent space can be induced by dataset distillation. Combine this with state-of-the-art projection methods to create the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK).

Result: Dataset distillation yields 20-100× reduction in required Jacobian calculations. Per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. DNTK reduces NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while maintaining kernel structure and predictive performance.

Conclusion: Data dimension compression through NTK-tuned dataset distillation is an effective approach to reduce NTK computational complexity, complementing existing projection methods and enabling more efficient kernel computations without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally limited by the need to evaluate large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches reduce this cost primarily through projecting and sketching the Jacobian. We show that NTK computation can also be reduced by compressing the data dimension itself using NTK-tuned dataset distillation. We demonstrate that the neural tangent space spanned by the input data can be induced by dataset distillation, yielding a 20-100$\times$ reduction in required Jacobian calculations. We further show that per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. Building on these insights, we propose the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK), which combines NTK-tuned dataset distillation with state-of-the-art projection methods to reduce up NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving kernel structure and predictive performance.

### [167] [Predictive Associative Memory: Retrieval Beyond Similarity Through Temporal Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11322)
*Jason Dury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAM introduces a predictive associative memory system that learns temporal co-occurrence patterns rather than relying on similarity-based retrieval, achieving high precision in recalling true temporal associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural memory systems rely on similarity-based retrieval, which fails to capture biological memory's fundamental property of association through temporal co-occurrence.

Method: Proposes Predictive Associative Memory (PAM) with a JEPA-style predictor trained on temporal co-occurrence within continuous experience streams, using an Inward JEPA that predicts associatively reachable past states.

Result: Achieves 97% precision for true temporal associates, significantly outperforms cosine similarity on cross-boundary recall (0.421 vs 0), and achieves discrimination AUC of 0.916 vs 0.789 for cosine similarity.

Conclusion: PAM successfully captures temporal association structure in memory, demonstrating that predictive learning of temporal co-occurrence patterns provides a more biologically plausible and effective memory mechanism than similarity-based retrieval.

Abstract: Current approaches to memory in neural systems rely on similarity-based retrieval: given a query, find the most representationally similar stored state. This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds. All results are stable across seeds (SD < 0.006) and query selections (SD $\leq$ 0.012).

TL;DR: Reformulates multi-objective combinatorial optimization as online learning over decomposed decision spaces using bandit algorithms, achieving near-specialized solver performance with massive efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective combinatorial optimization sacrifice either generality, scalability, or theoretical guarantees when dealing with exponentially large discrete spaces.

Method: Reformulates the problem as online learning over decomposed decision space, solving position-wise bandit subproblems via adaptive expert-guided sequential construction.

Result: Achieves 80-98% of specialized solvers' performance with 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement in sample/computational efficiency over Bayesian optimization; outperforms competing methods on real-world hardware-software co-design for AI accelerators.

Conclusion: Bandit optimization over decomposed decision spaces provides a principled alternative to surrogate modeling or offline training for multi-objective optimization, with advantages growing with problem scale and objective count.

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization seeks Pareto-optimal solutions over exponentially large discrete spaces, yet existing methods sacrifice generality, scalability, or theoretical guarantees. We reformulate it as an online learning problem over a decomposed decision space, solving position-wise bandit subproblems via adaptive expert-guided sequential construction. This formulation admits regret bounds of $O(d\sqrt{T \log T})$ depending on subproblem dimensionality \(d\) rather than combinatorial space size. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves 80--98\% of specialized solvers performance while achieving two to three orders of magnitude improvement in sample and computational efficiency over Bayesian optimization methods. On real-world hardware-software co-design for AI accelerators with expensive simulations, we outperform competing methods under fixed evaluation budgets. The advantage grows with problem scale and objective count, establishing bandit optimization over decomposed decision spaces as a principled alternative to surrogate modeling or offline training for multi-objective optimization.

### [169] [Structured Hybrid Mechanistic Models for Robust Estimation of Time-Dependent Intervention Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11350)
*Tomer Meir,Ori Linial,Danny Eytan,Uri Shalit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach for estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems outperforms purely data-driven or mechanistic methods, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust methods for estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems like medical applications (e.g., propofol anesthesia dosing). Data-driven models fail in OOD regimes, while mechanistic models may be oversimplified.

Method: Decomposes transition operator into parametric (mechanistic) and nonparametric (data-driven) components, distinguishing intervention-related vs unrelated dynamics. Uses two-stage procedure with pre-training on simulated data when mechanistic parameters are unknown.

Result: Hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly in out-of-distribution regimes. Demonstrated on periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injection scenarios.

Conclusion: Hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models show potential for robust intervention optimization in complex real-world dynamical systems by leveraging mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data.

Abstract: Estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems is crucial for outcome optimization. In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems.

### [170] [Bootstrapping-based Regularisation for Reducing Individual Prediction Instability in Clinical Risk Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11360)
*Sara Matijevic,Christopher Yau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bootstrapping-based regularization framework for deep neural networks improves prediction stability while maintaining interpretability and performance, addressing reliability issues in clinical prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical prediction models using deep learning often suffer from instability - predictions vary substantially when trained on different samples from the same population. This instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption, creating a need for more stable and trustworthy models.

Method: Proposes a novel bootstrapping-based regularization framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into deep neural network training. The approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties rather than using ensemble methods.

Result: The model showed improved prediction stability across simulated data and three clinical datasets (GUSTO-I, Framingham, SUPPORT) with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I) and fewer significantly deviating predictions. It maintained discriminative performance and feature importance consistency (high SHAP correlations: 0.894 for GUSTO-I, 0.965 for Framingham).

Conclusion: The bootstrapping-based regularization approach achieves greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability, providing a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, especially valuable in data-limited healthcare settings.

Abstract: Clinical prediction models are increasingly used to support patient care, yet many deep learning-based approaches remain unstable, as their predictions can vary substantially when trained on different samples from the same population. Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings.

### [171] [Retrieval-Aware Distillation for Transformer-SSM Hybrids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11374)
*Aviv Bick,Eric P. Xing,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Retrieval-aware distillation converts Transformers to hybrid models by preserving only 2% of attention heads (critical for retrieval) and distilling rest into recurrent heads, achieving 95%+ teacher performance with 5-6× memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models (SSMs) are efficient for sequence modeling but underperform Transformers on tasks requiring in-context retrieval. The performance gap is linked to specific attention heads that SSMs struggle to replicate.

Method: Propose retrieval-aware distillation: identify essential Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) attention heads via ablation on synthetic retrieval tasks, preserve only these critical heads (just 2% of total), and distill remaining heads into recurrent heads to create a hybrid model.

Result: Preserving only 2% of attention heads (10 heads in 1B model) recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks. Hybrid model achieves 5-6× memory efficiency by reducing both attention cache and SSM state dimension.

Conclusion: Retrieval-aware distillation effectively bridges the Transformer-SSM gap by strategically preserving critical retrieval heads while converting others to recurrent form, achieving near-teacher performance with significantly improved memory efficiency.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient sequence modeling but lag behind Transformers on benchmarks that require in-context retrieval. Prior work links this gap to a small set of attention heads, termed Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A), which SSMs struggle to reproduce. We propose *retrieval-aware distillation*, which converts a pretrained Transformer into a hybrid student by preserving only these retrieval-critical heads and distilling the rest into recurrent heads. We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\times$ reduction in state dimension. By reducing both the attention cache and the SSM state, the resulting hybrid is $5$--$6\times$ more memory-efficient than comparable hybrids, closing the Transformer--SSM gap at a fraction of the memory cost.

*Amirpasha Hedayat,Alberto Padovan,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both latent subspace and dynamics online outperform static ROMs when forecasting beyond training regimes, with hybrid approach being most reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static projection-based ROMs become ineffective when systems leave training manifolds, limiting practical utility. Need for ROMs that can adapt online to evolving dynamics beyond initial training data.

Method: Three adaptive formulations: 1) Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), 2) Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), 3) Hybrid approach initializing NiTROM with OpInf update. Includes online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget considerations.

Result: On perturbed lid-driven cavity flow: static ROMs drift or destabilize beyond training; Adaptive OpInf suppresses amplitude drift; Adaptive NiTROM achieves near-exact energy tracking with frequent updates; Hybrid approach is most reliable under regime changes with minimal offline data, producing physically coherent fields and bounded energy.

Conclusion: Predictive ROM claims must be cost-aware with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes. Adaptive non-intrusive ROMs provide practical template for self-correcting models that remain effective as dynamics evolve beyond initial manifold.

Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.

TL;DR: WSBD is a novel optimizer for Quantum Neural Networks that uses parameter-wise freezing to reduce computational cost and mitigate barren plateaus, achieving 63.9% faster convergence than Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QNN training faces two major challenges: high computational cost of gradient estimation and the barren plateau problem where optimization landscapes become flat, making training inefficient and difficult.

Method: Weighted Stochastic Block Descent (WSBD) with dynamic parameter-wise freezing strategy that identifies and temporarily freezes less influential parameters based on gradient-derived importance scores, focusing computational resources effectively.

Result: WSBD converges 63.9% faster than Adam on average for ground-state-energy problems, with advantage growing with QNN size. Formal convergence proof provided, and parameter-wise freezing outperforms traditional layer-wise approaches.

Conclusion: WSBD effectively addresses QNN training challenges by reducing computational overhead while maintaining full expressive capacity, offering a practical solution for efficient quantum neural network optimization.

Abstract: The training of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is hindered by the high computational cost of gradient estimation and the barren plateau problem, where optimization landscapes become intractably flat. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Stochastic Block Descent (WSBD), a novel optimizer with a dynamic, parameter-wise freezing strategy. WSBD intelligently focuses computational resources by identifying and temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on a gradient-derived importance score. This approach significantly reduces the number of forward passes required per training step and helps navigate the optimization landscape more effectively. Unlike pruning or layer-wise freezing, WSBD maintains full expressive capacity while adapting throughout training. Our extensive evaluation shows that WSBD converges on average 63.9% faster than Adam for the popular ground-state-energy problem, an advantage that grows with QNN size. We provide a formal convergence proof for WSBD and show that parameter-wise freezing outperforms traditional layer-wise approaches in QNNs.

TL;DR: Novel algorithms for robust MDPs with general policy parameterization achieve improved sample complexity for both s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets, with first guarantees for average reward setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on robust MDPs is limited to tabular policies, lacking sample complexity guarantees or having high computational costs. There's a need for efficient methods that work with general policy parameterization beyond simple rectangular uncertainty sets.

Method: Reduce average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs to restore strong duality. Prove novel Lipschitz properties for general policies. Introduce multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with improved sample complexity. Design projected gradient descent for s-rectangular uncertainty and Frank-Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty.

Result: Achieve sample complexity of O(ε⁻⁵) for s-rectangular uncertainty, O(ε⁻⁴) for discounted non-rectangular uncertainty, and O(ε⁻¹⁰·⁵) for average reward non-rectangular uncertainty. Multilevel Monte Carlo estimator improves gradient estimation by factor O(ε⁻²).

Conclusion: First work providing sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond (s,a)-rectangularity. Provides first such guarantees in average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs.

Abstract: We study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization under s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets. Prior work is largely limited to tabular policies, and hence either lacks sample complexity guarantees or incurs high computational cost. Our method reduces the average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality and enabling tractable equilibrium computation. We prove novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations that extends to infinite state spaces. To address infinite-horizon gradient estimation, we introduce a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity, a factor of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ improvement over prior work. Building on this, we design a projected gradient descent algorithm for s-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-5})$) and a Frank--Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ discounted, $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-10.5})$ average reward), significantly improving prior results in both the discounted setting and average reward setting. Our work is the first one to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond $(s, a)$-rectangularity. It also provides the first such guarantees in the average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs.

### [175] [Sparse Semantic Dimension as a Generalization Certificate for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11388)
*Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs generalize well despite huge parameter counts because their internal representations lie on low-dimensional sparse manifolds, measured by Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why LLMs generalize robustly despite having far more parameters than training tokens, which contradicts standard statistical learning theory predictions of overfitting.

Method: Introduce Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD) - a complexity measure derived from active feature vocabulary of Sparse Autoencoders trained on model layers. Treat LLM and SAE as frozen oracles to analyze generalization via sparsity rather than parameter count.

Result: Empirical validation on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B shows non-vacuous generalization bounds. Discover "feature sharpness" scaling law: larger models (Gemma-2B) need fewer calibration samples to identify active manifold than smaller ones (GPT-2). Framework works as safety monitor detecting out-of-distribution inputs via "feature explosion."

Conclusion: LLM generalization is controlled by sparse, low-dimensional semantic manifolds rather than total parameters. Larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. The SSD framework provides practical generalization certificates and safety monitoring through feature violation detection.

Abstract: Standard statistical learning theory predicts that Large Language Models (LLMs) should overfit because their parameter counts vastly exceed the number of training tokens. Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive "feature sharpness" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable "feature explosion" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient steering of unconditional diffusion models without gradient guidance during inference, using noise alignment and transferable concept vectors for fast controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for guiding unconditional diffusion models require either retraining with conditional inputs or per-step gradient computations (classifier-based guidance), both of which incur substantial computational overhead.

Method: Two key observations: 1) Noise Alignment - coarse semantic steering is possible even in early corrupted stages using lightweight, offline-computed guidance signals; 2) Transferable concept vectors - concept directions in activation space transfer across timesteps and samples, learned via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM) without backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance while achieving significant inference speedups.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables efficient steering of unconditional diffusion models without gradient guidance during inference, providing a general recipe for fast controllable generation with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Guiding unconditional diffusion models typically requires either retraining with conditional inputs or per-step gradient computations (e.g., classifier-based guidance), both of which incur substantial computational overhead. We present a general recipe for efficiently steering unconditional diffusion {without gradient guidance during inference}, enabling fast controllable generation. Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance, while achieving significant inference speedups.

### [177] [Can We Really Learn One Representation to Optimize All Rewards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11399)
*Chongyi Zheng,Royina Karegoudra Jayanth,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies forward-backward (FB) representation learning for RL, proposes a simplified one-step FB method that performs policy improvement rather than enabling optimal control, and shows significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mysterious training objective and learning behavior of forward-backward (FB) representation learning, which aims to learn priors over policies for arbitrary reward functions without fine-tuning.

Method: Analyzes FB through connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping, then proposes one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB) that performs one step of policy improvement instead of enabling optimal control.

Result: One-step FB converges to errors 10^5 times smaller and improves zero-shot performance by +24% on average across 10 state-based and image-based continuous control domains.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demystifies FB representation learning and demonstrates that a simplified one-step approach focusing on policy improvement rather than optimal control yields significantly better performance.

Abstract: As machine learning has moved towards leveraging large models as priors for downstream tasks, the community has debated the right form of prior for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\%$ on average.

TL;DR: CADET is a decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn that achieves 11.04% CTR lift over baseline by addressing unique challenges like post-scoring signals, offline-online consistency, and industrial scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While DLRMs dominate CTR prediction and generative recommenders show promise in content recommendation, adapting transformer architectures to ads CTR prediction faces unique challenges: handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads.

Method: CADET introduces: (1) context-conditioned decoding with multi-tower heads for post-scoring signals; (2) self-gated attention for stable training; (3) timestamp-based RoPE for temporal relationships; (4) session masking to prevent train-serve skew; (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels.

Conclusion: CADET demonstrates that decoder-only transformers can be effectively adapted for industrial-scale ads CTR prediction by addressing unique deployment challenges, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional DLRM approaches.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is fundamental to online advertising systems. While Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) with explicit feature interactions have long dominated this domain, recent advances in generative recommenders have shown promising results in content recommendation. However, adapting these transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction still presents unique challenges, including handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads. We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders. The system has been successfully deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform, serving the main traffic for homefeed sponsored updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeSynth framework shows linear models collapse to simple oscillations regardless of signal complexity, while nonlinear models (Transformers, CNNs, MLPs) gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases, challenging prior claims of linear model dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent debates question whether complex nonlinear architectures truly outperform simple linear models in time series forecasting, with prior claims of linear model dominance often based on biased benchmarks lacking diverse temporal dynamics.

Method: Developed TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key real-world time series properties (non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, phase modulation) by creating synthesized signals with parameters derived from real-world data. Evaluated four model families: Linear, MLP, CNN, and Transformer models.

Result: Linear models systematically collapse to simple oscillations regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Transformers and CNNs show slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals than MLPs. Framework also reveals robustness differences under distribution/noise shifts.

Conclusion: TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence. Nonlinear models demonstrate clear advantages over linear models as signal complexity increases.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental tool with wide ranging applications, yet recent debates question whether complex nonlinear architectures truly outperform simple linear models. Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.

### [180] [Multi-Level Strategic Classification: Incentivizing Improvement through Promotion and Relegation Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11439)
*Ziyuan Huang,Lina Alkarmi,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategic classification framework with multi-level thresholds instead of classifier weights, showing how to incentivize honest effort through promotion-relegation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing strategic classification research focuses on classifier weights, but agents often manipulate responses dishonestly when it's cheaper than genuine effort. The paper aims to design mechanisms that incentivize honest improvement rather than manipulation.

Method: Uses a multi-level promotion-relegation framework with designed classifier thresholds and difficulty progression. Analyzes inter-temporal incentives considering agent farsightedness, skill retention, and self-reinforcing qualification effects.

Result: Characterizes optimal long-term agent strategies and proves that under mild conditions, principals can design threshold sequences to incentivize honest effort, enabling agents to reach arbitrarily high levels through genuine improvement.

Conclusion: Threshold design in multi-level frameworks can effectively address strategic manipulation by aligning agent incentives with honest effort, offering a viable alternative to weight-centric approaches in strategic classification.

Abstract: Strategic classification studies the problem where self-interested individuals or agents manipulate their response to obtain favorable decision outcomes made by classifiers, typically turning to dishonest actions when they are less costly than genuine efforts. While existing studies on sequential strategic classification primarily focus on optimizing dynamic classifier weights, we depart from these weight-centric approaches by analyzing the design of classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework. Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts.

*Nghia Nguyen,Tianjiao Ding,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCEP is a hierarchical concept embedding framework that improves interpretability in image classification by incorporating concept hierarchies into sparse coding, outperforming baselines in concept recovery while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretable-by-design models using sparse concept recovery ignore hierarchical structure of concepts, leading to inconsistent explanations that don't respect concept hierarchies. There's a need for methods that incorporate semantic hierarchies to produce more reliable and faithful explanations.

Method: HCEP constructs a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space of vision-language models and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover concepts present in an image. It assumes correct concepts form a rooted path in the hierarchy and derives conditions for identifying them in the embedded space.

Result: HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. It shows superior performance in concept recovery and classification accuracy when sample size is limited. Hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings where vanilla sparse coding fails.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models. The hierarchical approach improves concept recovery and maintains competitive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are gaining traction in computer vision because they provide faithful explanations for their predictions. In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM) uses conditional generative models and feature augmentation to classify lower back movements from noisy, limited Motion Tape sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Back pain assessment requires monitoring lower back movements, but current motion capture sensors are expensive and impractical for remote monitoring. Motion Tape offers a low-cost wearable alternative but produces small, noisy datasets.

Method: MT-AIM uses conditional generative models to create synthetic Motion Tape data for desired movements and predicts joint kinematics as additional features to augment the limited, noisy dataset.

Result: MT-AIM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning pipeline effectively addresses challenges of limited sample size and noise in wearable sensor data, enabling accurate remote monitoring of back movements for clinical applications.

Abstract: Back pain is a pervasive issue affecting a significant portion of the population, often worsened by certain movements of the lower back. Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.

Motivation: Existing approaches use global time-warping that ignores spatially heterogeneous dynamics in anatomical shape evolution. Need to understand how shapes evolve with covariates and quantify spatially varying uncertainties for healthcare research.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a novel approach for modeling anatomical shape evolution with spatially varying uncertainty quantification, addressing limitations of existing global methods and providing clinically useful insights.

Abstract: Understanding how anatomical shapes evolve in response to developmental covariates and quantifying their spatially varying uncertainties is critical in healthcare research. Existing approaches typically rely on global time-warping formulations that ignore spatially heterogeneous dynamics. We introduce PRISM, a novel framework that bridges implicit neural representations with uncertainty-aware statistical shape analysis. PRISM models the conditional distribution of shapes given covariates, providing spatially continuous estimates of both the population mean and covariate-dependent uncertainty at arbitrary locations. A key theoretical contribution is a closed-form Fisher Information metric that enables efficient, analytically tractable local temporal uncertainty quantification via automatic differentiation. Experiments on three synthetic datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate PRISM's strong performance across diverse tasks within a unified framework, while providing interpretable and clinically meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel sparse recovery method for Poisson noise using external-division Bregman operators integrated into NoLips algorithm, reducing bias from ℓ₁ regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse vector recovery from Poisson noise models suffers from estimation bias with classical ℓ₁-norm regularization, and conventional KL-based approaches have convergence issues.

Method: Introduces external-division Bregman proximity operator for sparsity promotion with reduced bias, embedded into NoLips algorithm via plug-and-play replacement of standard Bregman operator.

Result: Method shows more stable convergence than KL-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and image restoration problems.

Conclusion: The external-division operator effectively addresses bias in Poisson sparse recovery while maintaining computational efficiency through integration with established optimization framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models corrupted by Poisson noise. The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains challenging.

Method: Integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions to yield compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration, restricting GFNs to these subspaces while maintaining diversity through exploration of different subspaces.

Result: Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

Conclusion: CMAB-GFN effectively addresses the exploration challenge in GFlowNets by combining CMAB pruning with GFlowNet policies, accelerating discovery of high-value candidates while preserving diversity.

Abstract: As a probabilistic sampling framework, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show strong potential for constructing complex combinatorial objects through the sequential composition of elementary components. However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose CMAB-GFN, which integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

*Suraj Ranganath,Anish Patnaik,Vaishak Menon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-bit planning behavior depends on both total bitwidth and bit allocation across modules, with 4-bit settings showing allocation sensitivity in spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether efficient spatial reasoning with low-bit precision is determined more by total bitwidth or by how bits are allocated across different model modules.

Method: Used DINO-WM on Wall planning task with paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise quantization variants under two planner budgets.

Result: Found consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit/6-bit close to FP16, 3-bit collapses, 4-bit is allocation-sensitive. Preserving encoder precision improves planning, and mixed vs uniform INT4 results become budget-conditioned in stricter replication.

Conclusion: Module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies are needed for efficient spatial reasoning, as bit allocation matters in transition regimes between high and low precision.

Abstract: Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: GFlowNets face convergence issues in large state spaces; proposed method restricts actor exploration using planner-partitioned overlapping partial spaces with heuristic switching for faster convergence and better diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets freely explore large state spaces, leading to significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. The paper aims to address this scalability issue.

Method: Introduces a planner to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Uses heuristic strategy to switch between partial regions to prevent wasted exploration. Actor iteratively explores these partial spaces to converge toward high-reward subregions.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method converges faster than existing works on large state spaces, generates candidates with higher rewards, and significantly improves diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses GFlowNets' convergence challenges in large state spaces through restricted exploration in partitioned partial spaces, achieving better performance and diversity.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have shown promising potential to generate high-scoring candidates with probability proportional to their rewards. As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity.

*Diptarka Chakraborty,Kushagra Chatterjee,Debarati Das,Tien-Long Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First streaming algorithm for fair consensus clustering with constant-factor approximation using only logarithmic memory, plus a generic fairness-agnostic framework that improves offline results too.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fair consensus clustering methods require storing all input clusterings, which is impractical for large-scale streaming applications where data arrives sequentially and memory is limited.

Method: Develop a streaming algorithm that processes input clusterings sequentially while storing only logarithmic number of inputs. Introduce a generic framework combining closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, which is fairness-agnostic and works with any fairness definition that allows efficient computation of approximately close fair clustering.

Result: First constant-factor approximation algorithm for fair consensus clustering in streaming model with logarithmic memory. The framework also yields improved approximation guarantees when applied offline. Methods extend to k-median consensus clustering.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first streaming solution for fair consensus clustering with strong theoretical guarantees, introduces a versatile fairness-agnostic framework that improves both streaming and offline settings, and demonstrates broader applicability to k-median consensus clustering.

Abstract: Consensus clustering seeks to combine multiple clusterings of the same dataset, potentially derived by considering various non-sensitive attributes by different agents in a multi-agent environment, into a single partitioning that best reflects the overall structure of the underlying dataset. Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently. Finally, we extend our methods to the more general k-median consensus clustering problem.

### [189] [Calibrating an Imperfect Auxiliary Predictor for Unobserved No-Purchase Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11505)
*Jiangkai Xiong,Kalyan Talluri,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops calibration methods to convert potentially biased auxiliary predictions of outside-option probabilities into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using only purchase data, enabling better market-size and preference estimation without collecting new no-purchase labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms often lack data on consumer outside options (buying from competitors, not buying, or not considering offers), making market-size and preference estimation difficult with only transaction data. Existing approaches rely on auxiliary data that may be biased when trained in different contexts.

Method: Two calibration methods: 1) Under affine miscalibration in logit space, a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters. 2) Under weaker nearly monotone conditions, a rank-based calibration method with finite-sample error bounds that separate auxiliary-predictor quality from utility-learning error.

Result: The methods enable consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without new labels, with error bounds quantifying how calibration accuracy affects downstream revenue performance in assortment optimization. Numerical experiments show improvements in no-purchase estimation and assortment decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration framework effectively leverages imperfect auxiliary predictors to overcome missing outside-option information, providing statistically valid no-purchase estimates and quantifying the impact on business decisions, with extensions for combining multiple predictors.

Abstract: Firms typically cannot observe key consumer actions: whether customers buy from a competitor, choose not to buy, or even fully consider the firm's offer. This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors.

Abstract: The transition toward localized intelligence through Small Language Models (SLMs) has intensified the need for rigorous performance characterization on resource-constrained edge hardware. However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

*Li He,Qiang Qu,He Zhao,Stephen Wan,Dadong Wang,Lina Yao,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified regularization approach for RLHF that balances reward hacking prevention and stable optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF approaches address reward hacking and stable optimization separately with different regularization strategies (KL-divergence penalty against SFT model for reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping for stability). The implicit trade-off between regularizing towards both the initial SFT model and current policy remains under-explored.

Method: Introduces a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. The method yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with superior trade-off properties, simplifying implementation complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed unified regularization approach provides a principled solution to the core RLHF challenges of reward hacking and stable optimization, offering better performance and simpler implementation than existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has advanced alignment capabilities significantly but remains hindered by two core challenges: \textbf{reward hacking} and \textbf{stable optimization}. Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADMIRE is an adaptive milestone reward mechanism for RL-based mobile GUI agents that addresses the reward fidelity-density trade-off by dynamically creating milestones from successful explorations and using asymmetric credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL struggles with temporal credit assignment in long-horizon tasks due to the trade-off between outcome rewards (high fidelity but sparse) and process rewards (dense but prone to bias and reward hacking).

Method: Proposes ADMIRE: constructs verifiable adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectories to milestones dynamically distilled from successful explorations, with asymmetric credit assignment that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed ones.

Result: Consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld, and shows robust generalizability across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments (web navigation, embodied tasks).

Conclusion: ADMIRE effectively resolves the reward fidelity-density conflict in RL for mobile GUI agents, demonstrating significant performance improvements and strong generalization capabilities across various algorithms and environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for training Mobile GUI Agents, yet it struggles with the temporal credit assignment problem inherent in long-horizon tasks. A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks.

*Eunyeong Cho,Jehyeon Bang,Ranggi Hwang,Minsoo Rhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PASCAL introduces phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLMs to reduce Time-To-First-Token by prioritizing reasoning phases and using controlled preemption during answering phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based LLMs with Chain-of-Thought inference have extended reasoning phases that delay user-visible output and inflate TTFT. Existing serving frameworks don't distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, causing performance degradation under GPU memory constraints.

Method: PASCAL uses phase-aware scheduling that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT, with controlled preemption and token pacing during answering phases to preserve QoE. It features a hierarchical scheduler combining instance-level placement with intra-instance execution, enabling dynamic migration at phase boundaries.

Result: Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment.

Conclusion: Phase-aware scheduling is crucial for efficient reasoning-based LLM deployment, and PASCAL demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning-based LLMs leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference introduces new serving challenges, as their extended reasoning phases delay user-visible output and inflate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.

### [194] [AltTS: A Dual-Path Framework with Alternating Optimization for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11533)
*Zhihang Yuan,Zhiyuan Liu,Mahesh K. Marina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALTTS is a dual-path framework that decouples autoregressive dynamics from cross-dimension interactions using alternating optimization to improve long-horizon multivariate time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multivariate time series forecasting models struggle with an optimization conflict: trying to capture both stable within-series autoregressive dynamics and intermittent cross-dimension interactions in a single model leads to gradient corruption, brittle training, and degraded long-horizon accuracy.

Method: ALTTS uses a dual-path framework with alternating optimization: (1) an autoregressive path with a linear predictor for stable within-series dynamics, and (2) a cross-relation path with a Transformer using Cross-Relation Self-Attention for intermittent cross-dimension interactions. The two paths are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce interference.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: Carefully designed optimization strategies (like alternating optimization in dual-path frameworks) can be more important than increasingly complex architectures for advancing multivariate time series forecasting, particularly for long-horizon accuracy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves two qualitatively distinct factors: (i) stable within-series autoregressive (AR) dynamics, and (ii) intermittent cross-dimension interactions that can become spurious over long horizons. We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting.

*Jingkun Liu,Yisong Yue,Max Welling,Yue Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Krause Attention replaces global softmax attention with bounded-confidence consensus dynamics, enabling localized sparse interactions that reduce computation to linear complexity while preventing representation collapse and attention sinks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-attention in Transformers uses globally normalized softmax weights, causing all tokens to compete for influence at every layer. This leads to synchronization dynamics that favor convergence toward a dominant mode, resulting in representation collapse and attention sink phenomena.

Method: Introduces Krause Attention, inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics. Replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions. This promotes structured local synchronization instead of global mixing, reducing runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length.

Result: Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation.

Conclusion: Bounded-confidence dynamics serve as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention, naturally moderating attention concentration and alleviating attention sinks while maintaining performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers relies on globally normalized softmax weights, causing all tokens to compete for influence at every layer. When composed across depth, this interaction pattern induces strong synchronization dynamics that favor convergence toward a dominant mode, a behavior associated with representation collapse and attention sink phenomena. We introduce Krause Attention, a principled attention mechanism inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics. Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention.

### [196] [Real-Time Proactive Anomaly Detection via Forward and Backward Forecast Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11539)
*Luis Olmos,Rashida Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two proactive anomaly detection frameworks (FFM and BRM) using hybrid TCN-GRU-Transformer architecture outperform state-of-the-art methods in early anomaly detection on multivariate time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive anomaly detection fails for time-sensitive applications requiring early intervention. Existing proactive methods struggle with heterogeneous multivariate data and noisy conditions.

Method: Two frameworks: Forward Forecasting Model (FFM) forecasts future sequences, and Backward Reconstruction Model (BRM) reconstructs recent history from future context. Both use hybrid TCN-GRU-Transformer architecture to model directional temporal dynamics.

Result: FFM and BRM outperform state-of-the-art baselines on four benchmark datasets (MSL, SMAP, SMD, PSM) across detection metrics and significantly improve timeliness of anomaly anticipation.

Conclusion: The proposed proactive anomaly detection approach is well-suited for deployment in time-sensitive domains requiring proactive monitoring due to its robust performance with heterogeneous multivariate data.

Abstract: Reactive anomaly detection methods, which are commonly deployed to identify anomalies after they occur based on observed deviations, often fall short in applications that demand timely intervention, such as industrial monitoring, finance, and cybersecurity. Proactive anomaly detection, by contrast, aims to detect early warning signals before failures fully manifest, but existing methods struggle with handling heterogeneous multivariate data and maintaining precision under noisy or unpredictable conditions. In this work, we introduce two proactive anomaly detection frameworks: the Forward Forecasting Model (FFM) and the Backward Reconstruction Model (BRM). Both models leverage a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformer encoders to model directional temporal dynamics. FFM forecasts future sequences to anticipate disruptions, while BRM reconstructs recent history from future context to uncover early precursors. Anomalies are flagged based on forecasting error magnitudes and directional embedding discrepancies. Our models support both continuous and discrete multivariate features, enabling robust performance in real-world settings. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MSL, SMAP, SMD, and PSM, demonstrate that FFM and BRM outperform state-of-the-art baselines across detection metrics and significantly improve the timeliness of anomaly anticipation. These properties make our approach well-suited for deployment in time-sensitive domains requiring proactive monitoring.

### [197] [Native Reasoning Models: Training Language Models to Reason on Unverifiable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11549)
*Yuanfu Wang,Zhixuan Liu,Xiangtian Li,Chaochao Lu,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NRT (Native Reasoning Training) is a new framework that trains reasoning models without needing human-written reasoning traces or external verifiers, using only question-answer pairs and treating reasoning as a latent variable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods (SFT + RLVR) require expensive human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers, which introduces human biases and limits application to objectively assessable domains like math/coding, leaving many unverifiable tasks inaccessible.

Method: NRT treats reasoning process as a latent variable, uses a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase likelihood of correct answers, and creates self-reinforcing feedback loops.

Result: NRT achieves SOTA performance among verifier-free methods on Llama and Mistral models, significantly outperforming SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods, with strong gains in complex reasoning domains and high robustness to policy collapse.

Conclusion: NRT offers a general, scalable path toward more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems by eliminating dependency on human annotations and external verifiers while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for training large reasoning models--combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)--is fundamentally constrained by its reliance on high-quality, human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers. This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems.

TL;DR: TS-Memory: A lightweight memory adapter for Time Series Foundation Models that distills retrieval-based corrections into parametric memory for efficient domain adaptation without inference latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time Series Foundation Models struggle with domain adaptation under distribution shift. Existing methods face trade-offs: parametric adaptation causes catastrophic forgetting and requires costly maintenance, while non-parametric retrieval improves forecasts but adds high inference latency.

Method: Propose Parametric Memory Distillation implemented as TS-Memory, a two-stage approach: 1) Construct offline kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures, 2) Distill retrieval-induced distributional correction into lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision.

Result: Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks show consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to frozen backbone.

Conclusion: TS-Memory enables efficient retrieval-free deployment by fusing memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, solving the trade-off between adaptation quality and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) achieve strong zero-shot forecasting through large-scale pre-training, but adapting them to downstream domains under distribution shift remains challenging. Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.

*Jichu Li,Xuan Tang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, showing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction affect max-margin behavior and convergence rates under different norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochastic optimization methods (like SignSGD and Muon) behave differently from full-batch optimization, specifically characterizing when stochastic updates align with full-batch implicit bias and what factors influence this alignment.

Method: Theoretical analysis of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent under general entry-wise and Schatten-p norms, examining convergence behavior with different batch sizes, momentum, and variance reduction techniques.

Result: Without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches; momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off but slows convergence; variance reduction recovers exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size; batch-size-one without momentum converges to fundamentally different bias.

Conclusion: The unified analysis clarifies conditions under which stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, revealing limitations of purely stochastic updates and providing explicit dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results.

Abstract: A variety of widely used optimization methods like SignSGD and Muon can be interpreted as instances of steepest descent under different norm-induced geometries. In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform for Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) that standardizes benchmarking across 15 BFMs and 18 datasets to analyze how pretraining data, self-supervised learning strategies, and architectures affect model generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the rapid growth of Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) for neural signal analysis, the field lacks unified understanding of methodologies and standardized evaluation frameworks, creating a need for systematic benchmarking to guide development of more accurate and transferable BFMs.

Method: The authors map the benchmark design space along two axes: (1) organizing BFMs under a self-supervised learning taxonomy from the model perspective, and (2) summarizing downstream tasks and curating representative public datasets from the dataset perspective. They then build Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces integrating 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets.

Result: The Brain4FMs platform enables standardized comparisons and analysis of how pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures affect generalization and downstream performance across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications.

Conclusion: Brain4FMs provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework that will guide the development of more accurate and transferable Brain Foundation Models by establishing standardized evaluation practices and enabling systematic analysis of key factors influencing model performance.

Abstract: Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) are transforming neuroscience by enabling scalable and transferable learning from neural signals, advancing both clinical diagnostics and cutting-edge neuroscience exploration. Their emergence is powered by large-scale clinical recordings, particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, which provide rich temporal and spatial representations of brain dynamics. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets. It enables standardized comparisons and analysis of how pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures affect generalization and downstream performance, guiding more accurate and transferable BFMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Brain4FMs-85B8.

*Yujie Gu,Richeng Jin,Zhaoyang Zhang,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSynSAM improves federated learning with gradient compression by using synthetic data from global model trajectory to accurately estimate perturbations for Sharpness Aware Minimization, addressing performance degradation from non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient compression in federated learning causes sharper loss landscapes (especially with non-IID data), hurting generalization. Direct SAM application fails due to inaccurate global perturbation estimation from data heterogeneity, and existing methods using previous model updates don't work well with compression.

Method: FedSynSAM leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data, enabling accurate estimation of global perturbation for SAM. This allows effective flat minima search despite gradient compression and data heterogeneity.

Result: The algorithm is proven to converge theoretically, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness in improving performance with gradient compression in federated learning under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: FedSynSAM successfully addresses the performance degradation caused by gradient compression in federated learning by enabling accurate perturbation estimation for SAM through synthetic data from global model trajectory.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that gradient compression in federated learning (FL) enjoys significant improvement in communication efficiency with negligible performance degradation. In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProSeCo introduces a progressive self-correction framework for masked diffusion models that enables iterative refinement of generated tokens, improving both quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models have limitations where once tokens are unmasked they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and degraded sample quality. The paper aims to address this fundamental limitation.

Method: Proposes Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. Reuses MDM denoising network outputs as inputs for corrector training, and applies corrective refinement steps between unmasking steps during generation.

Result: ProSeCo achieves better quality-efficiency trade-offs (2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling for improved sample quality (up to 1.3x improvement on benchmarks).

Conclusion: The Progressive Self-Correction framework successfully addresses the error accumulation problem in masked diffusion models by enabling iterative refinement of entire sequences, including already generated tokens.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models, enabling parallel token generation while achieving competitive performance. Despite these advantages, MDMs face a fundamental limitation: once tokens are unmasked, they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and ultimately degrading sample quality. We address this by proposing a framework that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks).

*Naveen Sahi,Jeremy Dohmann,Armen Aghajanyan,Akshat Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkillRater introduces multidimensional data filtering with specialized raters per capability, outperforming monolithic scoring by preserving diversity early and focusing on high-value samples late.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-score data curation is limited because it cannot optimize for multiple distinct model capabilities simultaneously. Quality should be multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a specific capability the model needs to learn.

Method: SkillRater decomposes data filtering into specialized raters (one per capability), each trained via meta-learning on disjoint validation objectives. It uses progressive selection: samples are retained if any rater ranks them above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples later.

Result: On vision language models (2B parameters), SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM reasoning. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming independent quality dimensions.

Conclusion: Multidimensional quality decomposition outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering by capturing genuinely independent capability dimensions and using progressive selection to balance diversity and quality throughout training.

Abstract: Data curation methods typically assign samples a single quality score. We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering.

*Tatsuya Sagawa,Ryosuke Kojima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling training resources for Chemical Language Models improves pretraining loss but yields limited downstream performance gains, revealing a gap between pretraining metrics and actual molecular property prediction effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically validate whether increasing training resources (model size, dataset size, compute) actually improves downstream molecular property prediction performance for Chemical Language Models, challenging the common assumption in the field.

Method: Pretrained CLMs while systematically scaling training resources, measured transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, analyzed alternative metrics (Hessian, loss landscape), and examined parameter space visualizations to understand failure modes.

Result: Pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased resources, but downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Alternative metrics also fail to estimate downstream performance. Downstream performance can saturate or degrade despite pretraining improvements, with task-dependent failure modes identified.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between pretraining-based evaluation and downstream performance in CLMs, necessitating new model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics rather than relying solely on pretraining metrics.

Abstract: Chemical Language Models (CLMs) pre-trained on large scale molecular data are widely used for molecular property prediction. However, the common belief that increasing training resources such as model size, dataset size, and training compute improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance has not been systematically validated in the chemical domain. In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics.

Motivation: Probabilistic values (Shapley, Banzhaf) are commonly used for feature ranking in decision tree explanations, but they're unreliable for joint optimization of insertion/deletion metrics. The paper aims to develop more reliable feature ranking methods that directly optimize the joint objective.

Method: Proposes TreeGrad to compute gradients of multilinear extension of joint objective in O(L) time for trees with L leaves. Introduces TreeGrad-Ranker for feature ranking by aggregating gradients while optimizing joint objective, and TreeGrad-Shap for stable Beta Shapley value computation. Also develops TreeProb as generalization of Linear TreeShap.

Result: TreeGrad-Shap shows up to 10^15 times smaller numerical error than Linear TreeShap. TreeGrad-Ranker significantly outperforms on insertion and deletion metrics. The method satisfies all probabilistic value axioms except linearity (which causes unreliability).

Conclusion: Direct optimization of joint objective via TreeGrad provides more reliable feature rankings than probabilistic values, with better empirical performance and numerical stability, while maintaining desirable axiomatic properties.

Abstract: We revisit the use of probabilistic values, which include the well-known Shapley and Banzhaf values, to rank features for explaining the local predicted values of decision trees. The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/watml/TreeGrad.

*Wenqian Chen,Yucheng Fu,Michael Penwarden,Pratanu Roy,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArGEnT is a geometry-aware Transformer architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains that integrates with DeepONet to create surrogates that generalize across varying geometries without explicit geometry parametrization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is challenging in scientific machine learning, especially in many-query regimes like design optimization, control, and inverse problems where surrogates must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations.

Method: Proposes Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT) with three attention variants (self-attention, cross-attention, hybrid-attention) to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations. Integrates ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, eliminating the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input.

Result: Significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared to standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware surrogates across benchmark problems in fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and electrochemical systems. Cross-attention variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions.

Conclusion: ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems by combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.

### [207] [GP2F: Cross-Domain Graph Prompting with Adaptive Fusion of Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11629)
*Dongxiao He,Wenxuan Sun,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) remains effective in cross-domain settings by combining pre-trained knowledge with task-specific adaptation, with GP2F method outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPL research focuses on cross-domain scenarios where pre-training and downstream tasks have different data distributions, but it's unclear why GPL remains effective under such domain shifts. The authors observed that GPL methods are competitive with simple baselines like full fine-tuning and linear probing, motivating deeper investigation into the prompting mechanism.

Method: Theoretical analysis shows that combining two complementary branches (pre-trained knowledge and task adaptation) reduces estimation error. Based on this insight, the authors propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method with: (1) a frozen branch retaining pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. The method uses adaptive fusion under topology constraints via contrastive loss and topology-consistent loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that GP2F outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Cross-domain GPL benefits from integrating pre-trained knowledge with task-specific adaptation, and the proposed GP2F method effectively implements this dual-branch approach to achieve superior performance in cross-domain settings.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [208] [TIP: Resisting Gradient Inversion via Targeted Interpretable Perturbation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11633)
*Jianhua Wang,Yinlin Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIP is a novel defense against gradient inversion attacks in federated learning that uses interpretability and frequency analysis to selectively perturb critical channels, preserving model accuracy while preventing data reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like Differential Privacy use indiscriminate noise injection that severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. There's a need for targeted approaches that can defend against gradient inversion attacks while maintaining good model performance.

Method: TIP uses a dual-targeting strategy: 1) Grad-CAM to identify critical convolution channels encoding semantic features, 2) transforms selected kernels to frequency domain via DFT and selectively injects calibrated perturbations into high-frequency spectrum. This destroys fine-grained reconstruction details while preserving low-frequency information for accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines. Significantly outperforms existing DP-based defenses in privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

Conclusion: TIP provides an effective defense against gradient inversion attacks by selectively perturbing high-frequency components of critical channels, achieving superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to traditional DP methods while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while preserving data locality; however, the exchange of gradients renders the system vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs), allowing adversaries to reconstruct private training data with high fidelity. Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

### [209] [Both Topology and Text Matter: Revisiting LLM-guided Out-of-Distribution Detection on Text-attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11641)
*Yinlin Zhu,Di Wu,Xu Wang,Guocong Quan,Miao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LG-Plug is an LLM-guided plug-and-play strategy for OOD detection in text-attributed graphs that aligns topology and text representations, generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting, and integrates with existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs for text-attributed graphs struggle with OOD nodes in real-world settings, leading to overconfident predictions. Early topology-driven methods fail to exploit rich semantic information, while recent LLM-based approaches suffer from reliability-informativeness imbalance in synthesized OOD priors and architectural limitations that prevent leveraging topology-level insights.

Method: LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. It uses lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling to reduce LLM querying time cost. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes.

Result: The method enables seamless integration with existing OOD detectors by providing improved OOD exposure that addresses the reliability-informativeness imbalance and incorporates both semantic and structural information.

Conclusion: LG-Plug offers a practical solution for OOD detection in text-attributed graphs by effectively combining LLM-guided semantic understanding with topology-aware representations, overcoming limitations of both topology-only and LLM-only approaches.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) associate nodes with textual attributes and graph structure, enabling GNNs to jointly model semantic and structural information. While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.

### [210] [UMAP Is Spectral Clustering on the Fuzzy Nearest-Neighbor Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11662)
*Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMAP performs spectral clustering on fuzzy k-nearest neighbor graphs, connecting UMAP to contrastive learning and spectral methods through theoretical proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite UMAP's popularity for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, its exact relationship with classical spectral methods has remained informal and unclear. The authors aim to provide rigorous theoretical grounding for UMAP's behavior by establishing its connection to spectral clustering.

Method: Three-step proof: (1) Show UMAP's stochastic optimization with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on similarity graphs; (2) Use HaoChen et al.'s result that contrastive learning on similarity graphs equals spectral clustering; (3) Verify UMAP's spectral initialization computes exact linear solution to this spectral problem.

Result: Proved that UMAP performs spectral clustering on fuzzy k-nearest neighbor graphs. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels and holds as first-order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy-type kernel.

Conclusion: Unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under single theoretical framework, providing rigorous grounding for empirical observations about UMAP's behavior and connecting it to classical spectral methods.

Abstract: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is among the most widely used algorithms for non linear dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. Despite its popularity, and despite being presented through the lens of algebraic topology, the exact relationship between UMAP and classical spectral methods has remained informal. In this work, we prove that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k nearest neighbour graph. Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels, and holds as a first order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy type kernel. Our result unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under a single framework, and provides theoretical grounding for several empirical observations about UMAP's behaviour.

*Tingkai Jia,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes first-order algorithms for non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization that eliminate Hessian-vector products, achieving improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OBO algorithms rely on hypergradient descent requiring Hessian-vector product oracles, which incur high computational costs. The authors aim to develop more efficient first-order methods.

Method: Reformulate OBO as single-level online problem with inequality constraints using Lagrangian functions, eliminating HVPs from implicit differentiation. Propose two algorithms: 1) basic fully first-order algorithm, 2) improved variant with adaptive inner-iteration scheme.

Result: Basic algorithm achieves regret O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T}). Improved variant achieves regret O(√T + V_T), removing dependence on drift variation of inner-level optimal solution. The latter has advantage when V_T ≥ O(√T).

Conclusion: The proposed first-order algorithms provide computationally efficient alternatives to hypergradient-based methods for OBO, with improved regret guarantees and elimination of Hessian-vector product requirements.

Abstract: In this work, we study non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization (OBO). Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation. Specifically, we propose a fully first-order algorithm for OBO, and provide theoretical guarantees showing that it achieves regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$. Furthermore, we develop an improved variant with an adaptive inner-iteration scheme, which removes the dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution and achieves regret of $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$. This regret have the advatange when $V_{T}\ge O(\sqrt{T})$.

*David Fuentes-Jiménez,Sara García-de-Villa,David Casillas-Pérez,Pablo Floría,Francisco-Manuel Melgarejo-Meseguer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Motion capture systems combined with machine learning can effectively detect knee injury-related running patterns, with CNNs achieving the best performance (77.9% accuracy for PFPS detection).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running has high incidence of knee injuries (PFPS and ITBS), and identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, requiring precise systems for capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data.

Method: Used optical motion capture systems to analyze 839 treadmill recordings. Focused on stance phase using joint/segment angle time series and discrete point values. Tested three classification tasks (healthy vs. injured, PFPS, ITBS) with multiple feature spaces (point-based metrics, time series, hybrid). Evaluated classical algorithms (KNN, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs). Used explainability tools (Shapley values, saliency maps, Grad-CAM).

Result: Combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning outperforms classical methods, with CNNs achieving highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for combined injury class.

Conclusion: Motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning have strong potential for identifying knee injury-related running patterns, offering improved clinical decision-making tools for injury prevention and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Running is a widely practiced activity but shows a high incidence of knee injuries, especially Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) and Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS). Identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, which requires precise systems capable of capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data.
  This study uses optical motion capture systems to enhance detection of injury-related running patterns. We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.
  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).
  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.
  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.

### [214] [ANML: Attribution-Native Machine Learning with Guaranteed Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11690)
*Oliver Zahn,Matt Beton,Simran Chana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANML is a framework that weights training samples by quality factors (gradient consistency, verification, reputation, temporal relevance) to improve model performance and enable attribution, achieving significant error reduction and data efficiency while guaranteeing no performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training pipelines treat all samples equally, giving the same weight to high-quality expert contributions (like Nobel laureates' work) as to unverified submissions. This fails to leverage data provenance and quality information that could improve model performance and enable proper attribution.

Method: ANML combines gradient-based signals (what the model observes) with external provenance signals (what the system knows about data) through four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). It uses a Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism to ensure it never underperforms baselines.

Result: Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is highly data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. Contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods against subtle corruption.

Conclusion: ANML successfully integrates data provenance and quality information into training, improving both model performance and attribution capabilities while guaranteeing robustness against attacks. The framework demonstrates that quality-weighted training can be both more effective and more data-efficient than uniform weighting.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems increasingly train on specialized expert data, from clinical records to proprietary research to curated datasets, yet current training pipelines treat all samples identically. A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect.

### [215] [SpiralFormer: Looped Transformers Can Learn Hierarchical Dependencies via Multi-Resolution Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11698)
*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,You Wu,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpiralFormer is a looped Transformer with multi-resolution recursion that achieves better efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines by enabling hierarchical learning through iteration-wise functional specialization across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing looped Transformers operate at fixed full-token resolution, missing efficiency gains from compressed latent representations. There's a need for recursive architectures that can leverage multi-resolution processing for better hierarchical learning and computational efficiency.

Method: SpiralFormer uses multi-resolution recursion schedule where recurrence executes across different scales. It enables iteration-wise functional specialization across different resolution levels, allowing the model to learn hierarchical dependencies through compressed latent representations.

Result: SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B parameters. It establishes sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.

Conclusion: Multi-resolution recursion enables effective hierarchical learning in looped Transformers, providing better efficiency than fixed-resolution approaches and establishing resolution scaling as a promising direction for recursive architectures.

Abstract: Recursive (looped) Transformers decouple computational depth from parameter depth by repeatedly applying shared layers, providing an explicit architectural primitive for iterative refinement and latent reasoning. However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute. While recent literature has introduced more effective recursion mechanisms to mitigate this gap, existing architectures still operate at a fixed, full-token resolution, neglecting the potential efficiency of computing over compressed latent representations. In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B, establishing sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.

*Yongyao Wang,Ziqi Miao,Lu Yang,Haonan Jia,Wenting Yan,Chen Qian,Lijun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabSieve is a select-then-predict framework for tabular prediction that first selects informative rows as evidence, then predicts missing targets using that evidence, improving performance and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular models perform instance-wise inference and LLM-based prompting is brittle. Models don't consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. There's a need for explicit, auditable evidence usage in tabular prediction.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Select informative rows as evidence from the table, 2) Predict missing target conditioned on selected evidence. Uses TabSieve-SFT-40K dataset synthesized from 331 real tables with strict filtering, and TAB-GRPO reinforcement learning that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction with separate rewards and dynamic task-advantage balancing.

Result: On a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables, TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over second-best baseline. The model concentrates more attention on selected evidence, improving robustness to noisy context.

Conclusion: TabSieve provides an effective framework for explicit evidence usage in tabular prediction, demonstrating consistent performance improvements and better robustness through its select-then-predict approach and joint optimization of evidence selection and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Tabular prediction can benefit from in-table rows as few-shot evidence, yet existing tabular models typically perform instance-wise inference and LLM-based prompting is often brittle. Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context.

### [217] [Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712)
*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Potential-energy gating improves state estimation in double-well systems by modulating observation trust based on potential energy, achieving 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard robust filters treat all state space regions identically, while constrained filters impose hard bounds. Neither approach leverages the physics of double-well systems where observation reliability varies with potential energy near minima vs. barriers.

Method: Modulates observation noise covariance in Bayesian filters based on local potential energy value. Observations are trusted near potential minima and discounted near barriers. Implemented in Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters with only two hyperparameters.

Result: 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard Extended Kalman Filter on synthetic Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination. Robust to misspecification (≥47% improvement with 50% parameter error). 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions vs. 30% for naive baseline. Applied to Dansgaard-Oeschger events showing asymmetry parameter γ = -0.109 and outlier fraction explains 91% of variance in filter improvement.

Conclusion: Potential-energy gating provides physics-aware robust filtering for double-well systems, significantly outperforming standard methods while maintaining robustness to model misspecification. The approach successfully bridges statistical filtering with physical system knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.

### [218] [DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11715)
*Haolei Bai,Lingcheng Kong,Xueyi Chen,Jianmian Wang,Zhiqiang Tao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE is a diffusion LLM series for CUDA kernel generation that outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion models through a specialized dataset (CuKe) and bi-phase reinforcement learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs offer parallel token generation advantages for code generation tasks like CUDA kernels, but face challenges due to specialization requirements and lack of high-quality training data.

Method: Created CuKe dataset for CUDA kernels, developed BiC-RL framework with two phases (infilling and end-to-end generation), and built DICE diffusion LLMs at 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales.

Result: DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale on KernelBench, establishing new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses data scarcity and specialization challenges in CUDA kernel generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of diffusion LLMs with tailored training frameworks for specialized code generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

### [219] [Dopamine: Brain Modes, Not Brains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11726)
*Shervin Ghasemlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called "mode specialization" that adapts models by learning per-neuron thresholds and gains in activation space rather than modifying weights, enabling interpretable conditional computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA modify weights, making them hard to interpret mechanistically and not revealing which internal computations are reused versus bypassed for new tasks. The authors seek a more interpretable approach inspired by neuromodulation.

Method: Proposes a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron thresholds and gains. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.

Result: On MNIST vs rotated MNIST experiments, the method improves rotated accuracy over frozen baselines using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, exhibits partial activation sparsity, and trades some accuracy for fewer parameters and more interpretability compared to LoRA.

Conclusion: The paper presents an alternative neuromodulation-inspired view of adaptation as mode selection rather than weight rewriting, offering interpretable conditional computation but with reduced expressivity when the frozen base lacks needed features.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as \lora{} adapt large pretrained models by adding small weight-space updates. While effective, weight deltas are hard to interpret mechanistically, and they do not directly expose \emph{which} internal computations are reused versus bypassed for a new task. We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \emph{thresholds} and \emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.
  As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \methodname{}. Across seeds, \methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active). Compared to \lora{}, \methodname{} trades some accuracy for substantially fewer trainable parameters and a more interpretable ``which-neurons-fire'' mechanism. We discuss limitations, including reduced expressivity when the frozen base lacks features needed for the target mode.

TL;DR: UFO (U-Former ODE) is a novel architecture combining U-Nets, Transformers, and Neural CDEs for fast, accurate probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Neural CDE approaches for irregular time series forecasting suffer from slow sequential computation, limited scalability, and lack of global context, which restricts their practical application.

Method: UFO integrates parallelizable U-Net multiscale feature extraction, Transformer global modeling, and Neural CDE continuous-time dynamics into a fully causal, parallelizable architecture with global receptive field and local temporal sensitivity.

Result: UFO consistently outperforms 10 state-of-the-art neural baselines on 5 standard benchmarks for both regular and irregular time series, with up to 15× faster inference than conventional Neural CDEs.

Conclusion: UFO successfully addresses the computational limitations of Neural CDEs while improving predictive accuracy, making it a scalable solution for probabilistic forecasting of irregular time series.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series is crucial in domains such as healthcare and finance, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences.

### [221] [TUBO: A Tailored ML Framework for Reliable Network Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11759)
*Zhihang Yuan,Leyang Xue,Waleed Ahsan,Mahesh K. Marina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TUBO is a novel ML framework for reliable network traffic forecasting that handles burst patterns and provides uncertainty quantification, achieving 4x better accuracy than existing methods and improving proactive traffic engineering throughput by 9x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for network traffic forecasting are unreliable because they can't effectively handle unique network traffic characteristics like burst patterns and complex traffic variations. Each model type has limited capability in capturing diverse traffic patterns.

Method: TUBO features two key components: 1) burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations, and 2) model selection that adapts to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. It provides deterministic predictions with quantified uncertainty to identify the most reliable forecasts.

Result: Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix datasets (Abilene, GEANT, CERNET) show TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods with 4x better forecasting accuracy and achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. For proactive traffic engineering, TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9x compared to reactive approaches and 3x compared to proactive TE using best existing forecasting methods.

Conclusion: TUBO successfully addresses the limitations of existing traffic forecasting models by handling burst patterns and providing uncertainty quantification, making it a reliable solution for network traffic forecasting that significantly improves both forecasting accuracy and downstream applications like traffic engineering.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting based network operation optimization and management offers enormous promise but also presents significant challenges from traffic forecasting perspective. While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSE is a model serving framework that decouples model scores from client decision boundaries, enabling seamless model updates in multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments without requiring client coordination for threshold recalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, retraining models shifts score distributions and invalidates existing decision thresholds. Recalibrating thresholds requires coordinating updates across hundreds of clients, creating bottlenecks, consuming excessive human hours, and leading to model stagnation.

Method: MUSE uses dynamic intent-based routing to share models across tenants and implements a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution, decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries.

Result: Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over 1,000 events per second and over 55 billion events in 12 months across dozens of tenants while maintaining high availability and low latency. It reduces model lead time from weeks to minutes.

Conclusion: MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saves millions in fraud losses and operational costs by eliminating the bottleneck of threshold recalibration across multiple clients in Score-as-a-Service environments.

Abstract: In binary classification systems, decision thresholds translate model scores into actions. Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.

### [223] [Temperature as a Meta-Policy: Adaptive Temperature in LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11779)
*Haoran Dang,Cuiling Lan,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAMPO is a framework that treats temperature control in LLMs as a learnable meta-policy, using hierarchical optimization to adaptively adjust temperature for better RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static or heuristic temperature schedules in LLMs fail to adapt to dynamic RL training demands, limiting policy improvement by not properly balancing exploration vs exploitation.

Method: Two-loop hierarchical process: inner loop updates LLM policy with trajectories sampled at meta-policy-selected temperature; outer loop updates temperature distribution by rewarding temperatures that maximize likelihood of high-advantage trajectories.

Result: Outperforms baselines with fixed/heuristic temperatures on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing temperature as effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration.

Conclusion: Temperature can be effectively treated as a learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning, enabling better policy improvement through trajectory-guided adaptation.

Abstract: Temperature is a crucial hyperparameter in large language models (LLMs), controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during text generation. High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

### [224] [Safe Fairness Guarantees Without Demographics in Classification: Spectral Uncertainty Set Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11785)
*Ainhize Barrainkua,Santiago Mazuelas,Novi Quadrianto,Jose A. Lozano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECTRE is a minimax-fair method for fairness-aware classification without demographic data that uses Fourier feature mapping with spectral adjustment and distributional constraints to avoid overemphasis on outliers while maintaining strong fairness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods require demographic group information which is rarely available in practice. Robust optimization approaches without demographic data often overemphasize outliers or pessimistic scenarios, compromising both performance and fairness.

Method: SPECTRE uses minimax optimization with Fourier feature mapping, adjusting the spectrum and constraining how much the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution to avoid over-pessimism.

Result: On American Community Survey datasets across 20 states, SPECTRE achieves the highest average fairness guarantees with smallest interquartile range, outperforming state-of-the-art methods even those with demographic information access.

Conclusion: SPECTRE provides a safe and effective approach for fairness-aware classification without demographic data, with theoretical bounds on worst-case error and characterization of worst-case distributions.

Abstract: As automated classification systems become increasingly prevalent, concerns have emerged over their potential to reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances

### [225] [Evaluating LLM Safety Under Repeated Inference via Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11786)
*Keita Broadwater*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APST introduces a depth-oriented evaluation framework for LLMs that repeatedly samples identical prompts to surface latent failure modes, modeling safety failures as stochastic outcomes to estimate per-inference failure probabilities and compare reliability across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM safety benchmarks focus on breadth across diverse tasks, but real-world deployment exposes operational failures from repeated inference on identical prompts. Response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical in high-stakes settings, requiring evaluation of reliability under repeated use.

Method: Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST) repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface failure modes like hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. It models failures as stochastic outcomes using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities for quantitative reliability comparison.

Result: Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts reveals that models with similar benchmark scores can have substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, especially as temperature increases. Shallow single-sample evaluation obscures meaningful reliability differences under sustained use.

Conclusion: APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment. It demonstrates the importance of depth-oriented evaluation for understanding operational failure risks in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.

*Sebastian Zeng,Andreas Petersson,Wolfgang Bock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for learning linear SPDE laws from spatiotemporal data using structured latent variables, combining spectral Galerkin projection with Wiener chaos expansion to separate deterministic evolution from stochastic forcing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for SPDEs either require access to driving noise/initial conditions or use deterministic surrogate models that fail to capture intrinsic stochasticity, creating a need for methods that can learn randomly forced dynamics from solution observations alone.

Method: Proposes a structured latent-variable formulation combining spectral Galerkin projection with truncated Wiener chaos expansion, reducing infinite-dimensional SPDE to finite ODE system. Uses variational learning to jointly infer latent dynamics and stochastic forcing without requiring noise observations during training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic data shows state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across both bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains.

Conclusion: The approach successfully learns underlying randomly forced dynamics from solution observations alone, providing a principled framework for SPDE learning that captures stochastic structure without requiring explicit noise access.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the law of linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with additive Gaussian forcing from spatiotemporal observations. Most existing deep learning approaches either assume access to the driving noise or initial condition, or rely on deterministic surrogate models that fail to capture intrinsic stochasticity. We propose a structured latent-variable formulation that requires only observations of solution realizations and learns the underlying randomly forced dynamics. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains.

TL;DR: CIR framework uses Tanh activation, skip connections, and convex Q-learning to constrain initial representations and improve off-policy RL sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-policy RL improvements overlook constraining initial representations of input data, which could alleviate distribution shift and stabilize training. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Constrained Initial Representations (CIR) framework with three components: (1) Tanh activation with normalization to stabilize representations, (2) skip connection module for linear pathway from shallow to deep layers, (3) convex Q-learning for flexible value estimation and reduced conservatism.

Result: CIR shows strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, being competitive with or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: Directly constraining initial representations through the CIR framework effectively improves off-policy RL sample efficiency and stability, with theoretical support for Tanh function's convergence properties under linear function approximation.

Abstract: Recently, there have been numerous attempts to enhance the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) agents when interacting with the environment, including architecture improvements and new algorithms. Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a benchmarking framework for fair graph link prediction that focuses on structural biases beyond homophily, introduces a taxonomy of topological bias measures, and develops a graph generation method to evaluate fairness interventions across diverse network topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness-aware methods for graph link prediction often focus on manipulating graph structures but fail to properly understand topological biases, reducing them to homophily alone. This limits generalization of fairness interventions and their applicability across diverse network topologies.

Method: 1) Review and formalize a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. 2) Introduce a flexible graph generation method that ensures fidelity to real-world patterns while enabling controlled variation across structural biases. 3) Apply this framework to evaluate classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases.

Result: Provides fine-grained empirical analysis of interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. Reveals sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and demonstrates need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new perspective on fair link prediction by highlighting the importance of structural biases beyond homophily, and underscores the necessity of structurally grounded fairness evaluations for better generalization across diverse network topologies.

Abstract: Graph link prediction (LP) plays a critical role in socially impactful applications, such as job recommendation and friendship formation. Ensuring fairness in this task is thus essential. While many fairness-aware methods manipulate graph structures to mitigate prediction disparities, the topological biases inherent to social graph structures remain poorly understood and are often reduced to homophily alone. This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases. Our results provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. This new perspective reveals the sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and underscores the need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning.

TL;DR: ISC method decomposes path signatures into temporally ordered incremental contributions, enabling sequential processing for time-sensitive control tasks, with ISC-Transformer showing strong performance in offline RL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard path signatures collapse temporal structure into a single global object, limiting their suitability for decision-making problems requiring step-wise reactivity and sensitivity to instantaneous trajectory updates.

Method: Proposes Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method that decomposes truncated path signatures into temporally ordered sequence of tensor-algebra elements corresponding to incremental contributions from last path increments, preserving algebraic structure while making temporal evolution explicit.

Result: ISC-Transformer (ISCT) integrates ISC into standard Transformer architecture and demonstrates strong performance on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d benchmarks, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets.

Conclusion: ISC provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks, enabling signature-based representations to be processed via sequential modeling approaches while maintaining sensitivity to instantaneous trajectory updates.

Abstract: Path signatures embed trajectories into tensor algebra and constitute a universal, non-parametric representation of paths; however, in the standard form, they collapse temporal structure into a single global object, which limits their suitability for decision-making problems that require step-wise reactivity. We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets. The results demonstrate that ISC method provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL), primarily due to RL's use of on-policy data. The authors aim to bridge this gap by enabling On-Policy SFT.

Method: Proposes Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT) to quantify alignment between data and model-induced distribution. Introduces two techniques: (1) In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT) - loss-level method to enhance SFT generalization, and (2) Hinted Decoding - data-level technique to re-align training corpus to model's distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms (DPO and SimPO) while maintaining SFT pipeline efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed On-Policy SFT framework offers a practical alternative to RL in domains where RL is infeasible, bridging the generalization gap while preserving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT

TL;DR: CAAL framework improves active learning for estimating atmospheric particle properties by decoupling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, outperforming standard methods in heteroscedastic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring atmospheric particle properties like toxicity and hygroscopicity requires complex/expensive methods, creating limited labeled data. Routine observations are noisy and heteroscedastic, making active learning challenging because standard uncertainty-based acquisition conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, wasting limited measurement budgets.

Method: Proposed Confidence-Aware Active Learning (CAAL) framework with two components: 1) decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimizes predictive mean and noise level for stable uncertainty estimation, and 2) confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as reliability signal.

Result: Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show CAAL consistently outperforms standard active learning baselines in heteroscedastic settings.

Conclusion: CAAL provides practical and general solution for efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases by addressing heteroscedastic noise challenges in active learning.

Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change requires global coordination but faces social dilemmas where rational economic actors prioritize immediate gains over collective welfare, creating misalignment between individual incentives and long-term sustainability goals.

Method: 1) Formal characterization of InvestESG multi-agent simulation conditions for intertemporal social dilemmas with theoretical thresholds; 2) Application of Advantage Alignment opponent shaping algorithm to influence agent learning in InvestESG; 3) Theoretical analysis of why Advantage Alignment biases learning toward cooperative outcomes.

Result: Advantage Alignment systematically favors socially beneficial equilibria by shaping learning processes, demonstrating that strategic intervention in agent learning can produce better outcomes that inform policy mechanisms for aligning market incentives with sustainability.

Conclusion: Strategically shaping economic agents' learning processes through algorithms like Advantage Alignment can help resolve climate change social dilemmas and better align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals, offering insights for policy design.

Abstract: Addressing climate change requires global coordination, yet rational economic actors often prioritize immediate gains over collective welfare, resulting in social dilemmas. InvestESG is a recently proposed multi-agent simulation that captures the dynamic interplay between investors and companies under climate risk. We provide a formal characterization of the conditions under which InvestESG exhibits an intertemporal social dilemma, deriving theoretical thresholds at which individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Building on this, we apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm shown to be effective in general-sum games, to influence agent learning in InvestESG. We offer theoretical insights into why Advantage Alignment systematically favors socially beneficial equilibria by biasing learning dynamics toward cooperative outcomes. Our results demonstrate that strategically shaping the learning processes of economic agents can result in better outcomes that could inform policy mechanisms to better align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals.

*Mohammad Khosravi,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust optimization for resilient communication networks with regenerator placement under uncertainty in both link lengths and installation costs, using dynamic budgeted uncertainty sets and scalable decomposition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication networks need reliable signal transmission, but signals degrade over distance requiring regenerators. Both network links and nodes face uncertainty - link lengths vary and regenerator installation costs are uncertain. Need robust solutions that guarantee connectivity under worst-case uncertainty.

Method: Formulate as robust optimization problem with budgeted uncertainty sets for costs and dynamic budgeted uncertainty for link lengths. Develop scalable methods: column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, iterative robust optimization. Also formulate learning-based hide-and-seek game for problem structure analysis.

Result: Proposed approaches evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations. Both theoretical analysis and computational results demonstrate effectiveness and advantages of the methodology.

Conclusion: The robust optimization framework with dynamic uncertainty sets and scalable decomposition methods provides effective solutions for resilient network design under uncertainty, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: We study the design of resilient and reliable communication networks in which a signal can be transferred only up to a limited distance before its quality falls below an acceptable threshold. When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations. Both theoretical analysis and computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our methodology.

*Sümeyye Meryem Taşyürek,Enis Mücahid İskender,Hacer Yalim Keles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A²V-SLP: An alignment-aware variational framework for sign language production that uses articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions instead of deterministic embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation and improved motion realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of deterministic latent embeddings in sign language production, which can lead to latent collapse and fail to maintain articulator-level representations. The goal is to improve alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion while enhancing motion realism.

Method: Proposes A²V-SLP: 1) Uses a disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode ground-truth sign pose sequences into articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, 2) Trains a non-autoregressive Transformer to predict both latent means and log-variances from text embeddings, 3) Incorporates stochastic sampling during decoding, 4) Integrates gloss attention mechanism to strengthen linguistic-motion alignment.

Result: Achieves consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, obtains state-of-the-art back-translation performance, and demonstrates improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

Conclusion: Distributional latent modeling with articulator-wise disentanglement effectively prevents deterministic latent collapse and maintains better articulator-level representations, leading to superior sign language production performance compared to deterministic approaches.

Abstract: Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE decoder reconstructs the final sign pose sequences through stochastic sampling at the decoding stage. This formulation maintains articulator-level representations by avoiding deterministic latent collapse through distributional latent modeling. In addition, we integrate a gloss attention mechanism to strengthen alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion. Experimental results show consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

*Elif Akata,Konstantinos Voudouris,Vincent Fortuin,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit in-context learning similar to Gaussian Process regression, with their performance approaching GP lower bounds as demonstrations increase, and their inductive biases can be steered toward smoother functions through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform in-context learning for continuous function learning tasks, and to quantify whether they behave like principled Gaussian Process learners with measurable inductive biases.

Method: Controlled experiments using multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors, comparing LLM predictions against GP-regression (lower bound) and 1-nearest-neighbor (upper bound) references. Also uses likelihood-based analysis to study inductive biases and explores post-training (RL and supervised fine-tuning) to shift biases.

Result: LLM learning curves approach GP lower bounds with more demonstrations, are most likely under less smooth GP kernels, and post-training can effectively shift inductive biases toward smoother kernels used in training data.

Conclusion: LLMs behave like GP learners for in-context function learning, and their inductive biases can be quantified and steered, providing tools for improving sample efficiency on continuous function tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstrations provided at inference time. We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks.

TL;DR: A universal diffusion-based framework that probabilistically downscales deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts to high-resolution predictions without model-specific tuning, showing consistent improvements across diverse forecasting systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting by creating a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface that works with heterogeneous upstream weather models without requiring fine-tuning for each specific model.

Method: Train a single conditional diffusion model on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km), then apply it in a zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from various AI-based and numerical weather prediction systems.

Result: The ensemble mean of downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's raw deterministic forecast, with substantially larger gains in probabilistic skill (measured by CRPS) across diverse forecasting systems up to 90-hour lead times.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines, demonstrating universal applicability across heterogeneous weather models.

Abstract: We introduce a universal diffusion-based downscaling framework that lifts deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts into probabilistic high-resolution predictions without any model-specific fine-tuning. A single conditional diffusion model is trained on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km resolution) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km resolution), and is applied in a fully zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from heterogeneous upstream weather models. Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.

*Suqin Yuan,Xingrui Yu,Jiyang Zheng,Lei Feng,Dadong Wang,Ivor Tsang,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPO is a drop-in modification to DPO that conditionally applies the reference signal to mitigate premature satisfaction in pessimistic preference pairs while preserving DPO's stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's reliance on a reference policy causes premature satisfaction in pessimistic pairs where the reference prefers the rejected response, leading to attenuated gradients even when the policy is still wrong.

Method: HyPO modifies DPO by conditionally applying the reference: behaves like DPO for optimistic/neutral references, but treats reference as neutral for pessimistic pairs by replacing Δ_θ-Δ_ref with Δ_θ-max{0,Δ_ref}.

Result: HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates across preference alignment tasks while preserving DPO's computational cost and objective form.

Conclusion: Direct preference alignment can be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal rather than discarding it, addressing the training-inference mismatch in DPO.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become the de facto standard for offline preference alignment of large language models, but its reliance on a reference policy introduces a critical tension. DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\max\{0,Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.

*Marco Bressan,Nataly Brukhim,Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi,Emmanuel Esposito,Yishay Mansour,Shay Moran,Maximilian Thiessen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAC learning of conditional averages over neighborhoods, generalizing classic PAC learning to tasks in explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PAC learning focuses on predicting exact labels, but many real-world applications require predicting average labels over neighborhoods (e.g., explainability needs local average predictions, fairness requires group-level statistics, recommendation systems benefit from neighborhood-based averages). The problem captures learning tasks from multiple domains.

Method: The authors formalize the conditional average learning problem in the PAC framework, where learners receive labeled samples but aim to predict neighborhood averages rather than exact labels. They analyze learnability through novel combinatorial parameters that depend on both the concept class and neighborhood system, relating these to the independence number of the neighborhood graph.

Result: Complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, with sample complexity bounds tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization depends on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters that combine concept class and neighborhood system properties.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes PAC learning to conditional average prediction, providing a theoretical foundation for learning tasks in explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems through a complete learnability characterization based on combinatorial graph parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of learning conditional averages in the PAC framework. The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.

TL;DR: Puzzle framework optimizes reasoning LLMs by reducing model size (120B→88B) via NAS techniques while maintaining accuracy, achieving up to 2.82X throughput gains but advocating for request-level metrics that account for reasoning token counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-focused LLMs generate long reasoning traces that increase serving costs, creating need for inference optimization without sacrificing answer quality.

Method: Post-training neural architecture search (Puzzle) applied to gpt-oss-120B: heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective window attention replacement, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning for accuracy recovery.

Result: Created gpt-oss-puzzle-88B with 1.63X/1.22X per-token throughput speedups (long/short context), 2.82X on single H100 GPU, and up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Matches/exceeds parent accuracy (100.8%-108.2% retention).

Conclusion: Post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality, but requires request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated to properly evaluate reasoning-focused models.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused LLMs improve answer quality by generating longer reasoning traces, but the additional tokens dramatically increase serving cost, motivating inference optimization. We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs) and Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) to address temporal inconsistency in adversarial attacks on time series forecasting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for time series forecasting ignore temporal consistency, causing contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples, making attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation.

Method: Proposes TUAPs with temporal unification constraint ensuring identical perturbations per timestamp across all overlapping samples, and TGAM - a modular gradient accumulation method that aggregates local gradient information from overlapping samples to generate TUAPs efficiently.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four state-of-the-art models show the method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attacks under TUAP constraints, and also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed TUAPs and TGAM effectively address temporal inconsistency in adversarial attacks for time series forecasting, providing practical, temporally consistent perturbations that work well in both constrained and unconstrained scenarios.

Abstract: While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines predictive multiplicity in AI systems and its implications for EU AI Act compliance, proposing practical tools and guidelines for evaluating and reporting model disagreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive multiplicity creates arbitrariness in AI decisions affecting individuals, conflicting with EU AI Act requirements for reporting performance at both dataset and individual levels. This legal-compliance gap needs addressing.

Method: Legal analysis of EU AI Act provisions combined with computational methods: (1) legal argument linking predictive multiplicity to accuracy requirements, (2) proposing individual conflict ratios and δ-ambiguity metrics, (3) deriving practical evaluation rules, (4) suggesting disclosure requirements.

Result: Provides concrete tools (individual conflict ratios, δ-ambiguity) to quantify model disagreement, practical implementation rules for model providers, and a framework for making multiplicity information available to system deployers under the AI Act.

Conclusion: Predictive multiplicity should be systematically evaluated and reported to ensure EU AI Act compliance, with providers quantifying disagreement and making this information available to deployers for assessing reliability of individual predictions.

Abstract: When building AI systems for decision support, one often encounters the phenomenon of predictive multiplicity: a single best model does not exist; instead, one can construct many models with similar overall accuracy that differ in their predictions for individual cases. Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning systems face performance degradation in heterogeneous scenarios where nodes have different data distributions and participate at varying frequencies, creating challenges for model convergence and fairness.

Method: 1) Node-side: Adds model-contrastive term using historical local models to improve update consistency in heterogeneous data. 2) Server-side: Uses cumulative participation counts to adjust aggregation weights, correcting bias from uneven participation. 3) Incorporates historical global models to reduce performance fluctuations between rounds.

Conclusion: PMFL effectively addresses FL challenges in heterogeneous environments through historical information utilization, improving model consistency, correcting aggregation bias, and stabilizing performance across training rounds.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple nodes to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.
  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a practical plug-and-play solution for reliable, transparent quality control in high-stakes compliance industries, with identified gaps in complex grammatical/punctuation error detection as future work areas.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to create content in regulated domains such as pharmaceuticals, where outputs must be scientifically accurate and legally compliant. Manual quality control (QC) is slow, error prone, and can become a publication bottleneck. We introduce LRBTC, a modular LLM and vision language model (VLM) driven QC architecture covering Language, Regulatory, Brand, Technical, and Content Structure checks. LRBTC combines a Student-Teacher dual model architecture, human in the loop (HITL) workflow with waterfall rule filtering to enable scalable, verifiable content validation and optimization. On AIReg-Bench, our approach achieves 83.0% F1 and 97.5% recall, reducing missed violations by 5x compared with Gemini 2.5 Pro. On CSpelling, it improves mean accuracy by 26.7%. Error analysis further reveals that while current models are strong at detecting misspellings (92.5 recall), they fail to identify complex medical grammatical (25.0 recall) and punctuation (41.7 recall) errors, highlighting a key area for future work. This work provides a practical, plug and play solution for reliable, transparent quality control of content in high stakes, compliance critical industries. We also provide access to our Demo under MIT Licenses.

*Kaicheng Xiao,Haotian Li,Liran Dong,Guoliang Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAM-Net introduces a novel architecture that bridges full attention expressivity and linear attention efficiency by using high-dimensional sparse vectors as explicit addresses to access massive memory states, enabling exponential state scaling without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention architectures compress unbounded history into fixed-size memory, which inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. There's a need to bridge the gap between full attention's representational capacity and linear models' memory efficiency.

Method: RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing selective access to a massive memory state. This enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, with inherent sparsity ensuring computational efficiency by confining state updates to minimal entries.

Result: RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAM-Net validates superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap between full attention expressivity and linear attention efficiency through its novel memory access architecture.

Abstract: While linear attention architectures offer efficient inference, compressing unbounded history into a fixed-size memory inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaT-LoRA: A parameter-efficient method for temporal domain generalization in LLMs that models temporal evolution in low-dimensional manifolds instead of full parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal distribution shifts are common in real-world LLM deployments as data evolves over time. Existing Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) approaches operate in full parameter space, which becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs.

Method: Proposes Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA) that constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, modeling evolution through a structured temporal core. This preserves low-dimensional temporal structure under parameter-efficient reparameterization.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (scientific documents, news publishers, review ratings) show MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.

Conclusion: The geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables effective temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space, dramatically reducing complexity while retaining expressive power for LLMs.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts are pervasive in real-world deployments of Large Language Models (LLMs), where data evolves continuously over time. While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.

*Yifei Jin,Xin Zheng,Lei Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm for adaptive identification in nonstationary streaming data, deriving theoretical tracking performance bounds and demonstrating practical effectiveness in time-varying systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams often exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying parameters, violating classical i.i.d. assumptions. This nonstationarity requires algorithms that can process data in single passes with constant computational/memory complexity, without expensive retraining.

Method: Investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool. Theoretically analyzes MLMS through second-order time-varying random vector difference equations (more complex than classical LMS's first-order equations) to derive tracking performance and regret bounds in time-varying stochastic linear systems.

Result: Derived theoretical tracking performance and regret bounds for MLMS under various practical conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams show MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, especially in nonstationary settings, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: MLMS demonstrates promise for modern streaming and online learning applications due to its computational simplicity, online processing capabilities, and robust performance in nonstationary environments, with theoretical foundations established through analysis of second-order random vector difference equations.

Abstract: In large-scale data processing scenarios, data often arrive in sequential streams generated by complex systems that exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying system parameters. This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Neuromorphic Learning enables energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning, but real deployments need additional privacy mechanisms like Differential Privacy that can significantly alter training signals, requiring analysis of how these mechanisms affect SNN firing rates and coordination.

Method: Analyzed how DP mechanisms (gradient clipping and noise injection) perturb firing-rate statistics in SNNs and propagate to rate-based FNL coordination. Conducted ablations across privacy budgets and clipping bounds on a speech recognition task under non-IID settings.

Result: Found systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. Related these shifts to sparsity and memory indicators in SNNs.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance for privacy-preserving FNL regarding the balance between privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination, showing how DP mechanisms affect SNN behavior in federated settings.

Abstract: Federated Neuromorphic Learning (FNL) enables energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning on devices without centralizing data. However, real-world deployments require additional privacy mechanisms that can significantly alter training signals. This paper analyzes how Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, specifically gradient clipping and noise injection, perturb firing-rate statistics in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and how these perturbations are propagated to rate-based FNL coordination. On a speech recognition task under non-IID settings, ablations across privacy budgets and clipping bounds reveal systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. Moreover, we relate these shifts to sparsity and memory indicators. Our findings provide actionable guidance for privacy-preserving FNL, specifically regarding the balance between privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination.

*Gongxi Zhu,Hanlin Gu,Lixin Fan,Qiang Yang,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGRPO: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework that uses reinforcement learning-style evaluation with competence-based expert selection and group-relative policy optimization to enhance foundation models without sharing data or model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated foundation model methods based on model-level or representation-level knowledge transfer have significant drawbacks: they require expensive local training, incur high communication costs, and introduce privacy risks by sharing model updates or representations.

Method: FedGRPO reformulates the problem as a reinforcement learning evaluation process with two modules: 1) Competence-based expert selection using a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify suitable clients for each question, and 2) Group-relative policy optimization that packages questions with solution rationales into candidate policies, dispatches them to selected expert clients, and aggregates only scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function.

Result: Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional federated foundation model baselines.

Conclusion: FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead by exchanging only reward values instead of data or model updates, while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices and maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: One important direction of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) is leveraging data from small client models to enhance the performance of a large server-side foundation model. Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the "Group Relative" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.

*Igor Dubinin,Antonio Orvieto,Felix Effenberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces two structured linear recurrent network architectures (H-LRU and BD-LRU) that increase expressivity through richer state mixing while maintaining computational efficiency, bridging the gap between efficient linear models and expressive nonlinear ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear recurrent networks (LRNNs) and state space models (SSMs) are computationally efficient but limited in expressivity due to diagonal state transitions, while expressive architectures like LSTMs are computationally costly. There's a need to bridge this efficiency-expressivity gap.

Method: Two structured LRNN architectures: 1) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU) that generalize first-order recurrence to higher order, mixing multiple past states; 2) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU) that enable dense intra-block channel mixing. Both use L1-normalization of selective gates for training stability and parallel-scan implementation for competitive throughput.

Result: BD-LRU matches or exceeds performance of linear SSMs (Mamba), low-rank LRNNs (DeltaNet) and LSTMs in synthetic sequence modeling. H-LRU is most parameter-efficient in compression tasks. Both architectures show that structure of state mixing (rather than width alone) shapes LRNN expressivity.

Conclusion: The proposed structured LRNN architectures offer a practical route to closing the efficiency-expressivity gap in linear sequence models by enabling richer state mixing across time and channels while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

Abstract: Linear recurrent networks (LRNNs) and linear state space models (SSMs) promise computational and memory efficiency on long-sequence modeling tasks, yet their diagonal state transitions limit expressivity. Dense and nonlinear architectures (e.g., LSTMs) on the other hand are provably more expressive, but computationally costly. Here, we explore how expressivity in LRNNs can be increased via richer state mixing across time and channels while maintaining competitive efficiency. Specifically, we introduce two structured LRNN architectures: (i) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU), which generalize first-order recurrence to higher order, mixing multiple past states, and (ii) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU), which enable dense intra-block channel mixing. Per-channel (H-LRU) or per-row (BD-LRU) L1-normalization of selective gates stabilizes training and allows for scaling window/block sizes. A parallel-scan implementation of the proposed architectures keeps the throughput competitive with diagonal LRNNs for moderate orders (H-LRU) and block sizes (BD-LRU). In synthetic sequence modeling tasks, the performance of BD-LRU matches or exceeds those of linear SSMs (Mamba), low-rank LRNNs (DeltaNet) and LSTM baselines, while H-LRU is found to be the most parameter-efficient in compression task. In both synthetic sequence modeling and language modeling, our results indicate that the structure of state mixing rather than width alone shapes expressivity of LRNNs, offering a practical route to closing the efficiency-expressivity gap in linear sequence models.

TL;DR: ProtoMech is a framework that discovers computational circuits in protein language models using cross-layer transcoders to capture full computational circuitry, enabling interpretable feature discovery and high-fitness protein design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability methods for protein language models treat each layer independently and fail to capture cross-layer computation, limiting their ability to approximate the full model's decision-making process.

Method: ProtoMech uses cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry, applied to the pLM ESM2.

Result: ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of original performance on protein tasks, identifies compressed circuits using <1% of latent space while retaining up to 79% accuracy, reveals correspondence with structural/functional motifs, and enables protein design surpassing baselines in >70% of cases.

Conclusion: ProtoMech establishes a principled framework for protein circuit tracing that enables interpretable understanding of pLM computations and practical applications in protein design.

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful predictors of protein structure and function. However, the computational circuits underlying their predictions remain poorly understood. Recent mechanistic interpretability methods decompose pLM representations into interpretable features, but they treat each layer independently and thus fail to capture cross-layer computation, limiting their ability to approximate the full model. We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases. These results establish ProtoMech as a principled framework for protein circuit tracing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrefillShare enables sharing prefill computation and KV cache across multiple LLMs in multi-agent systems, reducing redundancy and improving latency/throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems with multiple specialized LLMs redundantly process the same prompt prefix across models, increasing prefill load and worsening tail latency due to prefill-decode interference in existing serving stacks.

Method: PrefillShare factorizes models into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. It introduces a routing mechanism for sharing prefill across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system.

Result: PrefillShare matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, while delivering 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.

Conclusion: PrefillShare effectively eliminates inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt, significantly improving performance in multi-agent LLM serving systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems increasingly orchestrate multiple specialized language models to solve complex real-world problems, often invoking them over a shared context. This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.

TL;DR: A reciprocal-space generative pipeline for crystalline materials using Fourier transforms of species-resolved unit-cell density, enabling periodicity-native representation with space-group symmetry handling and variable atomic multiplicities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for crystalline materials struggle with periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, physical constraints, and scaling to large, diverse unit cells. There's a need for better approaches that can handle these fundamental crystallographic requirements while supporting variable atomic multiplicities.

Method: Proposes a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through truncated Fourier transforms of species-resolved unit-cell density instead of direct atomic coordinates. Uses only 9 Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension. Implements a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space.

Result: The approach successfully reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species using minimal Fourier basis functions. Evaluated on the LeMaterial benchmark, showing reconstruction and latent diffusion capabilities. Compared favorably against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime (≤16 atoms per unit cell).

Conclusion: The reciprocal-space Fourier representation provides a periodicity-native approach that naturally handles crystallographic symmetries and variable atomic multiplicities, addressing limitations of particle-based methods while scaling to larger unit cells with diverse structures.

Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials calls for generative models that handle periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and physical constraints, while scaling to large and structurally diverse unit cells. We propose a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through a truncated Fourier transform of the species-resolved unit-cell density, rather than modeling atomic coordinates directly. This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species. We instantiate this pipeline with a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients, and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space. We evaluate reconstruction and latent diffusion on the LeMaterial benchmark and compare unconditional generation against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime ($\leq 16$ atoms per unit cell).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong code generation capabilities, they don't guarantee runtime performance, especially in HPC domains where performance is critical. There's been little work on training LLMs using runtime performance as a reward signal.

Method: Proposed online reinforcement learning approach that executes generated code on a supercomputer and uses measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as reward.

Conclusion: Online RL with direct runtime performance feedback and staged optimization techniques is effective for improving LLMs' HPC code generation capabilities, addressing the performance gap in generated code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PathCRF: A framework for detecting soccer events using only player tracking data, eliminating need for ball tracking or manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soccer event data collection is labor-intensive and relies on expensive ball tracking, limiting data-driven analysis to top-tier competitions. There's a need for scalable, cost-effective alternatives.

Method: Models player trajectories as dynamic graph, formulates event detection as edge selection problem using CRF for logical consistency. Uses Set Attention-based backbone for edge embeddings, Viterbi decoding for inference.

Result: PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while reducing manual annotation needs.

Conclusion: The framework enables comprehensive soccer data collection without expensive ball tracking, making data-driven analysis more accessible across competitions.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Empirical GPs: A framework for learning Gaussian process priors directly from historical data instead of using handcrafted kernels, achieving competitive performance on regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GP kernels are handcrafted from limited standard functions, requiring expert knowledge, lacking adaptivity to data, and imposing strong assumptions. This limits GP effectiveness in practice.

Method: Empirical GPs estimate mean and covariance functions directly from historical data corpus rather than using parametric kernels. Uses Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates to handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets.

Result: Theoretically proven to converge to the GP closest (in KL-divergence) to the real data generating process. Practically achieves competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.

Conclusion: Empirical GPs provide a principled, data-driven alternative to handcrafted GP kernels that overcomes limitations of traditional approaches while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and widely used probabilistic regression models, but their effectiveness in practice is often limited by the choice of kernel function. This kernel function is typically handcrafted from a small set of standard functions, a process that requires expert knowledge, results in limited adaptivity to data, and imposes strong assumptions on the hypothesis space. We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets. We demonstrate that Empirical GPs achieve competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.

Conclusion: Transition-aware metric spaces provide a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making, eliminating the need for explicit probabilistic modeling and noise assumptions.

Abstract: Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

### [259] [On the Complexity of Offline Reinforcement Learning with $Q^\star$-Approximation and Partial Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12107)
*Haolin Liu,Braham Snyder,Chen-Yu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a negative answer to whether Q*-realizability and Bellman completeness are sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage, introduces a general framework for characterizing Q* function class complexity, and provides several theoretical improvements including better sample complexity bounds and extensions to broader settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question about whether Q*-realizability and Bellman completeness are sufficient for sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning under partial coverage, and to develop a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of Q* function classes beyond existing theoretical limitations.

Method: Introduces a general framework inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL, develops a novel second-order performance difference lemma, and combines decision-estimation decomposition with various Q* estimation procedures to modularize and generalize existing approaches.

Result: Establishes an information-theoretic lower bound showing Q*-realizability and Bellman completeness are insufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage, achieves ε^{-2} sample complexity for soft Q-learning (improving from ε^{-4}), removes need for additional online interaction, extends to low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness, and provides first analysis for CQL beyond tabular cases.

Conclusion: The paper provides fundamental theoretical insights into offline RL limitations, introduces a flexible framework for analyzing Q* function class complexity, and delivers several significant improvements to existing theoretical guarantees while extending analysis to previously unexplored settings.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, a setting that motivates practical algorithms such as Conservative $Q$-Learning (CQL; Kumar et al., 2020) but has received limited theoretical attention. Our work is inspired by the following open question: "Are $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?"
  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.
  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case.

*Arjun Mani,Carl Vondrick,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Bayesian Optimization setting that leverages high-dimensional auxiliary information from experiments and historical task data to accelerate optimization of expensive black-box functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experimental setups generate more information than just the performance measure, and historical data from similar tasks is often available but underutilized in traditional Bayesian Optimization.

Method: A neural model that predicts performance f(x) for unseen designs using few-shot context containing observations of auxiliary information h(x), leveraging historical task data from the same family.

Result: The method achieves more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization on robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning tasks, outperforming multi-task optimization baselines.

Conclusion: Effectively utilizing auxiliary experimental feedback and historical task data significantly improves optimization efficiency for expensive black-box design problems.

Abstract: Many real-world design problems involve optimizing an expensive black-box function $f(x)$, such as hardware design or drug discovery. Bayesian Optimization has emerged as a sample-efficient framework for this problem. However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization.

*Jiakang Shen,Qinghui Chen,Runtong Wang,Chenrui Xu,Jinglin Zhang,Cong Bai,Feng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-FIF is a lightweight multimodal framework for tropical cyclone monitoring that reduces parameters by 94.8% and speeds inference by 68.7% while maintaining accuracy, enabling edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TC monitoring methods are computationally inefficient and have high parameter counts, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships, leading to large model sizes and hardware incompatibility.

Method: Introduces KAN-FIF (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework), a lightweight multimodal architecture integrating MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers to capture complex feature interactions for TC attribute prediction.

Result: Achieves 94.8% parameter reduction (0.99MB vs 19MB), 68.7% faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms), and 32.5% lower MAE compared to baseline Phy-CoCo. Offline deployment on FY-4 satellite processor achieved 14.41ms per-sample inference latency.

Conclusion: KAN-FIF demonstrates promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extends deployability to edge-device AI applications, offering an efficient solution for timely tropical cyclone monitoring on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TC) are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing catastrophic damage to coastal regions through extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

### [262] [Meta-Sel: Efficient Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Supervised Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12123)
*Xubin Wang,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-Sel is a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for demonstration selection in in-context learning that learns an interpretable scoring function using TF-IDF similarity and length compatibility, outperforming 12 other methods across multiple datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstration selection is a critical bottleneck in in-context learning - accuracy varies significantly depending on which few-shot examples are chosen, but selection must remain computationally cheap to run per query over large candidate pools.

Method: Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling (candidate, query) pairs from training data with class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF-IDF cosine similarity and length-compatibility ratio. At inference, it performs a single vectorized scoring pass over candidates.

Result: Meta-Sel consistently ranks among top-performing methods across 12 benchmarked approaches, 4 intent datasets, and 5 open-source LLMs. It's particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can compensate for limited capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

Conclusion: Meta-Sel provides an effective, interpretable, and computationally efficient solution for demonstration selection that requires no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.
  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.
  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models trained with RL in environments with loopholes learn to exploit these flaws to maximize reward, developing generalizable exploitative strategies that transfer to new tasks and can be distilled between models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI alignment research focuses on preventing explicitly harmful content, but this paper investigates a more subtle risk: capability-oriented training induced exploitation, where models learn to exploit implicit loopholes in training environments to maximize reward without malicious intent.

Method: Designed a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games" with unique exploitable flaws (context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation). Trained language models with reinforcement learning in these environments to test whether they spontaneously learn to exploit the flaws.

Result: Models consistently learned to exploit vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increased their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. These exploitative strategies were not narrow tricks but generalizable skills that could be transferred to new tasks and distilled from teacher models to student models through data alone.

Conclusion: Capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches. Future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

Abstract: While most AI alignment research focuses on preventing models from generating explicitly harmful content, a more subtle risk is emerging: capability-oriented training induced exploitation. We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow "tricks" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even "distilled" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

### [264] [Learning beyond Teacher: Generalized On-Policy Distillation with Reward Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12125)
*Wenkai Yang,Weijie Liu,Ruobing Xie,Kai Yang,Saiyong Yang,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-OPD extends standard on-policy distillation with flexible reference models and reward scaling, showing that reward extrapolation (ExOPD) consistently improves performance and enables students to surpass teacher boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While on-policy distillation (OPD) shows strong empirical gains over off-policy methods, the authors aim to theoretically understand OPD and develop a more flexible framework to improve distillation performance, particularly in challenging settings like merging domain experts or strong-to-weak distillation.

Method: The authors first theoretically show OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL. They then propose Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) with two key extensions: 1) flexible reference model selection, and 2) reward scaling factor controlling reward vs KL regularization weight. They introduce ExOPD (reward scaling >1) and explore reward correction using teacher's pre-RL base model.

Result: ExOPD consistently outperforms standard OPD across various teacher-student size pairings. In domain expert merging, ExOPD enables students to surpass teacher performance boundaries. Reward correction further improves strong-to-weak distillation but requires access to teacher's pre-RL variant and more computation.

Conclusion: G-OPD provides a flexible framework that reveals reward extrapolation (ExOPD) as consistently beneficial and shows strategic reference model selection can further improve distillation, offering new insights for future OPD research.

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContiFormer combines Transformers with NODEs for irregular time series but suffers from computational bottlenecks. The paper proposes replacing NODEs with a linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy that has closed-form solutions, eliminating numerical solver overhead while maintaining expressivity and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with irregular time series due to uniform time interval assumptions. While ContiFormer combines NODEs with Transformers to handle irregular data, it inherits computational bottlenecks from numerical ODE solvers. The paper aims to develop a more efficient approach that maintains expressivity while eliminating computational overhead.

Method: Replace NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy that has known closed-form solutions. Model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators, and expand queries in a sinusoidal basis up to suitable modes. Attention is modeled as a resonance phenomenon, capturing query-key coupling fundamental to transformers.

Result: The approach eliminates computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. Proved that oscillator-based parameterization maintains universal approximation property of continuous-time attention. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.

Conclusion: The proposed oscillator-based transformer provides both theoretical guarantees and scalability, offering an efficient solution for irregular time series modeling that combines the strengths of transformers with the flexibility of continuous-time models without computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Transformers excel at time series modelling through attention mechanisms that capture long-term temporal patterns. However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation model benchmarks have four key limitations: 1) constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, 2) compromised data integrity lacking quality assurance, 3) misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and 4) rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights.

Method: Introduces TIME benchmark with 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks for strict zero-shot evaluation. Uses human-in-the-loop pipeline with LLMs and human expertise for data integrity. Redefines task formulation to align with real-world operational requirements. Proposes pattern-level evaluation using structural time series features instead of traditional dataset-level evaluations.

Result: Evaluated 12 representative TSFMs and established a multi-granular leaderboard with visualized inspection. The leaderboard is publicly available at Hugging Face Spaces.

Conclusion: TIME addresses critical gaps in existing benchmarks by providing fresh, high-quality data, real-world task alignment, and pattern-level evaluation that offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse temporal patterns.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation. However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection.

TL;DR: SafeNeuron is a neuron-level safety alignment framework that redistributes safety representations across LLMs to improve robustness against attacks and prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment in LLMs is brittle because safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making them vulnerable to neuron-level attacks. Most alignment methods operate at the behavioral level with limited control over internal safety mechanisms.

Method: SafeNeuron identifies safety-related neurons and freezes them during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways, forcing the model to construct redundant safety representations across the network.

Result: Extensive experiments show SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities while revealing that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations.

Conclusion: SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment by redistributing safety representations at the neuron level, offering better control over internal safety mechanisms and improved attack resistance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs are typically safety-aligned before release to prevent harmful content generation. However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRXForm is a graph transformer model for molecular optimization that uses group relative policy optimization to generalize across different starting structures without needing inference-time oracle calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular optimization methods are inefficient "instance optimizers" that restart search for every input structure, and existing model-based approaches fail to generalize due to high variance from heterogeneous starting structure difficulty.

Method: Adapts pre-trained Graph Transformer model for sequential atom-and-bond additions, using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning that normalizes rewards relative to starting structures to mitigate variance.

Result: GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving competitive multi-objective optimization scores with leading instance optimizers.

Conclusion: GRXForm addresses the generalization problem in molecular optimization through variance reduction via group relative policy optimization, enabling efficient transferable policies for structural alteration tasks.

Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.

*Yurong Chen,Yu He,Michael I. Jordan,Fan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how sampling strategies and reference policies affect preference alignment in LLMs, showing that instance-dependent sampling improves ranking while skewed sampling causes concentration issues, and that iterative alignment can lead to oscillations or entropy collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference alignment methods use pairwise comparisons and regularization toward reference policies, but the theoretical effects of sampling choices and reference policies are poorly understood. The paper aims to investigate these effects to better understand alignment dynamics.

Method: The study uses Identity Preference Optimization (a widely used preference alignment framework) to analyze sampling effects, then examines iterative alignment dynamics where learned policies feed back into future sampling and reference policies. Theoretical analysis extends to Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Proper instance-dependent sampling yields stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling induces excessive concentration under structured preferences. Iterative alignment dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameters, with identified stable regimes. Experiments on real-world preference data validate findings.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights into preference alignment dynamics, showing that sampling and reference choices significantly impact alignment outcomes. The findings apply broadly to preference-alignment methods and highlight the importance of careful parameter selection to avoid instability.

Abstract: Standard methods for aligning large language models with human preferences learn from pairwise comparisons among sampled candidate responses and regularize toward a reference policy. Despite their effectiveness, the effects of sampling and reference choices are poorly understood theoretically. We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods. Experiments on real-world preference data validate our findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveFormer integrates wavelet decomposition into transformers for biomedical signal classification, improving frequency-aware processing of long, complex time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers struggle with biomedical signals due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that require specialized frequency-domain processing.

Method: WaveFormer integrates wavelet decomposition at two stages: (1) embedding construction using multi-channel DWT to extract frequency features for tokens, and (2) positional encoding using Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) that adapts to signal-specific temporal structure via mono-channel DWT.

Result: WaveFormer achieves competitive performance on eight diverse biomedical datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, handling sequence lengths from 50-3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1-144.

Conclusion: WaveFormer provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification, addressing the unique challenges of biomedical signal processing.

Abstract: Biomedical signal classification presents unique challenges due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that are poorly captured by standard transformer architectures. We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.

TL;DR: CRAM introduces a memory consolidation mechanism that reduces attention usage over time by distilling episodic retrievals into parametric memory, achieving 37.8× attention reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid architectures apply attention uniformly or use static sparse patterns, missing the opportunity that attention demand should decrease as recurring patterns become familiar. Analysis of GPT-2 shows 88% of attention operations retrieve predictable information that doesn't decrease during training.

Method: CRAM (Consolidation-based Routing for Adaptive Memory) uses a biologically inspired memory consolidation mechanism that gradually distills episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory, enabling decreasing attention utilization over training.

Result: Achieves 37.8× attention reduction through phase transition at ~3K steps, 100% retrieval accuracy at 1.6% attention compute (vs. 68% for baselines), and consolidated patterns transfer to unseen tasks with 48-52% attention reduction without retraining.

Conclusion: CRAM demonstrates decreasing attention utilization is possible through consolidation, matches human memory transition curves, and proves static routing schemes cannot achieve such efficiency for tasks with recurring patterns.

Abstract: Hybrid architectures combining state-space models with attention have achieved strong efficiency-quality tradeoffs, yet existing approaches either apply attention uniformly or learn static sparse patterns. This misses a key opportunity: \emph{attention demand should decrease over time as recurring patterns become familiar}. We present a surprising finding from analyzing GPT-2 models: \textbf{88\%} of attention operations retrieve information already predictable from the model's hidden state, and this redundancy does \emph{not} decrease during training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce \textbf{\ours{}} (\textbf{C}onsolidation-based \textbf{R}outing for \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{M}emory), a biologically inspired memory consolidation mechanism that gradually distills episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory. Unlike prior sparse attention methods, \ours{} exhibits \emph{decreasing attention utilization} over training, achieving a \textbf{37.8$\times$} reduction through a sharp phase transition at approximately 3K steps. We prove that this capability is \emph{impossible} without consolidation: any static routing scheme requires $Ω(f \cdot n)$ attention for tasks with recurring patterns of frequency $f$. On our proposed SRCD benchmark, \ours{} achieves \textbf{100\% retrieval accuracy} at 1.6\% attention compute (vs.\ 68\% for baselines), and consolidated patterns transfer to unseen tasks with \textbf{48--52\%} attention reduction without retraining. Remarkably, the learned consolidation dynamics quantitatively match human episodic-to-semantic memory transition curves from cognitive psychology ($γ= 0.43$ vs.\ $γ_{\text{human}} \approx 0.4$--$0.5$).

*Christian Internò,Jumpei Yamaguchi,Loren Amdahl-Culleton,Markus Olhofer,David Klindt,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhyIP is a non-invasive evaluation protocol that tests whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen SSL representations, revealing latent physical world models that adaptation-based methods can obscure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations of neural models' physical understanding often use adaptation methods (fine-tuning, high-capacity probes) that can change representations and confound what was actually learned during self-supervised learning, making it hard to determine if models truly internalize physical laws.

Method: PhyIP (Physical Interpretability Protocol) tests whether physical quantities can be linearly decoded from frozen self-supervised learning representations without adaptation, based on the linear representation hypothesis. The protocol evaluates across domains like fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics.

Result: When SSL achieves low error, physical quantities become linearly accessible from frozen representations (ρ > 0.90 on OOD tests). PhyIP successfully recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling. In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure (ρ ≈ 0.05).

Conclusion: Adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures in neural models, while low-capacity linear probes (like PhyIP) offer more accurate evaluation of whether models have truly internalized physical world models during self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VMPO reformulates diffusion alignment as minimizing variance of importance weights rather than KL divergence, providing unified framework that recovers existing methods and enables new designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding diffusion alignment methods by viewing them through the lens of Sequential Monte Carlo and variance minimization rather than traditional KL-based objectives.

Method: VMPO formulates diffusion alignment as minimizing variance of log importance weights in SMC framework, where denoising model acts as proposal and reward guidance induces importance weights. Proves variance objective is minimized by reward-tilted target distribution.

Result: Shows variance minimization gradient coincides with KL-based alignment gradient under on-policy sampling, provides common framework that recovers various existing methods, and suggests new design directions beyond KL.

Conclusion: VMPO offers unified perspective on diffusion alignment through variance minimization, connecting existing methods and enabling novel approaches beyond traditional KL-based optimization.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment adapts pretrained diffusion models to sample from reward-tilted distributions along the denoising trajectory. This process naturally admits a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) interpretation, where the denoising model acts as a proposal and reward guidance induces importance weights. Motivated by this view, we introduce Variance Minimisation Policy Optimisation (VMPO), which formulates diffusion alignment as minimising the variance of log importance weights rather than directly optimising a Kullback-Leibler (KL) based objective. We prove that the variance objective is minimised by the reward-tilted target distribution and that, under on-policy sampling, its gradient coincides with that of standard KL-based alignment. This perspective offers a common lens for understanding diffusion alignment. Under different choices of potential functions and variance minimisation strategies, VMPO recovers various existing methods, while also suggesting new design directions beyond KL.

TL;DR: Categorical Flow Maps: A flow-matching method for fast few-step generation of categorical data using self-distillation and continuous trajectories that transport probability mass toward predicted endpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate few-step generation of categorical data by building on recent flow matching formulations and the trend toward accelerated inference in diffusion/flow models, while enabling natural constraints on model predictions.

Method: Defines flow maps toward the simplex that transport probability mass toward predicted endpoints, using continuous trajectories that can be trained with existing distillation techniques and a new endpoint consistency objective. The continuous formulation enables reuse of existing guidance and reweighting techniques.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, with strong performance even in single-step generation.

Conclusion: Categorical Flow Maps provide an effective approach for accelerated categorical data generation that leverages continuous flow matching and enables flexible guidance techniques while achieving strong few-step performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: We introduce Categorical Flow Maps, a flow-matching method for accelerated few-step generation of categorical data via self-distillation. Building on recent variational formulations of flow matching and the broader trend towards accelerated inference in diffusion and flow-based models, we define a flow map towards the simplex that transports probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, yielding a parametrisation that naturally constrains model predictions. Since our trajectories are continuous rather than discrete, Categorical Flow Maps can be trained with existing distillation techniques, as well as a new objective based on endpoint consistency. This continuous formulation also automatically unlocks test-time inference: we can directly reuse existing guidance and reweighting techniques in the categorical setting to steer sampling toward downstream objectives. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, with strong performance even in single-step generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Olmix is a data mixing framework that addresses practical challenges in real-world LM development by providing empirical guidance on mixing design choices and efficient mixture recomputation for evolving domain sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data mixing methods for language models fall short in real-world development due to unclear configuration spaces and inability to handle evolving domain sets as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised throughout development cycles.

Method: Olmix framework includes: 1) comprehensive empirical study of mixing method design choices to identify optimal configurations, and 2) mixture reuse mechanism that efficiently recomputes mixtures after domain-set updates by reusing existing ratios and only recomputing for affected domains.

Result: Over five domain-set updates mirroring real-world development, mixture reuse matches full recomputation performance with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Olmix provides a practical solution for data mixing in real-world LM development by addressing both configuration space uncertainty and domain set evolution, offering significant computational savings while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) with Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) by showing that intrinsic energies in JEPAs are quasimetrics, and optimal cost-to-go functions in QRL have intrinsic energy form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between representation learning (JEPAs) and goal-conditioned control (QRL) by showing their mathematical connections through intrinsic energies and quasimetrics.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing that intrinsic energies (defined as infima of accumulated local effort over trajectories) are quasimetrics under mild assumptions, and demonstrating that optimal cost-to-go functions in QRL have this intrinsic form.

Result: Established that JEPAs modeling intrinsic energies produce quasimetric value functions targeted by QRL, and showed why symmetric energies are mismatched with directional reachability problems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled connection between JEPA representation learning and QRL goal-conditioned control through quasimetric intrinsic energies, explaining when asymmetric (quasimetric) energies are necessary for directional problems.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) aim to learn representations by predicting target embeddings from context embeddings, inducing a scalar compatibility energy in a latent space. In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters.

TL;DR: ExtractBench is a benchmark and evaluation framework for PDF-to-JSON extraction that addresses gaps in evaluating enterprise-scale schemas and principled semantic evaluation of nested extraction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PDF-to-JSON extraction lacks proper evaluation: no end-to-end benchmark for enterprise-scale schema breadth, and no principled methodology for semantic evaluation of nested extraction with different correctness notions per field type.

Method: Created ExtractBench with 35 PDF documents paired with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields. Framework treats schema as executable specification where each field declares its scoring metric.

Result: Frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, with 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models.

Conclusion: ExtractBench addresses critical evaluation gaps in PDF-to-JSON extraction, revealing current LLM limitations on enterprise-scale schemas and providing an open-source framework for principled evaluation of structured information extraction.

Abstract: Unstructured documents like PDFs contain valuable structured information, but downstream systems require this data in reliable, standardized formats. LLMs are increasingly deployed to automate this extraction, making accuracy and reliability paramount. However, progress is bottlenecked by two gaps. First, no end-to-end benchmark evaluates PDF-to-JSON extraction under enterprise-scale schema breadth. Second, no principled methodology captures the semantics of nested extraction, where fields demand different notions of correctness (exact match for identifiers, tolerance for quantities, semantic equivalence for names), arrays require alignment, and omission must be distinguished from hallucination. We address both gaps with ExtractBench, an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework for PDF-to-JSON structured extraction. The benchmark pairs 35 PDF documents with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across economically valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields spanning schema complexities from tens to hundreds of fields. The evaluation framework treats the schema as an executable specification: each field declares its scoring metric. Baseline evaluations reveal that frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, culminating in 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models. We release ExtractBench at https://github.com/ContextualAI/extract-bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to conceal communities in graphs from GNN-based detection by strategically rewiring edges and modifying node features, achieving 20-45% concealment improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs can reveal sensitive community structures (like coordinated asset groups or operational hierarchies) through unsupervised learning, raising group-level privacy concerns that need defensive strategies.

Method: A perturbation strategy that rewires selected edges and modifies node features to reduce community distinctiveness exploited by GNN message passing, based on analysis of boundary connectivity and feature similarity.

Result: Outperforms DICE baseline under identical perturbation budgets, achieving median relative concealment improvements of 20-45% across synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates an effective mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlights group-level privacy risks inherent in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.

TL;DR: FGNO introduces a flow-guided neural operator framework for self-supervised learning on time-series data, using variable corruption levels and flow matching to learn versatile representations, achieving significant performance gains across biomedical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods like masked autoencoders use fixed masking ratios, limiting flexibility. The authors propose treating corruption level as a learnable parameter to enhance representation learning capabilities for time-series data.

Method: FGNO combines operator learning with flow matching, using Short-Time Fourier Transform to handle different time resolutions. It extracts hierarchical features from different network layers and flow times with varying noise strengths, enabling extraction of both low-level patterns and high-level global features from a single model.

Result: FGNO outperforms established baselines across three biomedical domains: 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.

Conclusion: FGNO demonstrates robustness to data scarcity and superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series, offering a flexible alternative to fixed-masking SSL approaches with significant performance improvements in biomedical applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.

TL;DR: Fun-DDPS is a generative framework combining function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operators for subsurface flow characterization in CCS, achieving 11x better accuracy with extreme data sparsity and 4x improved sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate subsurface flow characterization for Carbon Capture and Storage is challenged by ill-posed inverse problems with sparse observations, requiring methods that can handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic approaches fail.

Method: Fun-DDPS combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates. It learns a prior distribution over geological parameters using a single-channel diffusion model, then uses a Local Neural Operator surrogate for physics-consistent guidance and cross-field conditioning on dynamics fields.

Result: With only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error vs 86.9% for standard surrogates (11x improvement). It achieves Jensen-Shannon divergence <0.06 against ground truth, produces physically consistent realizations without high-frequency artifacts, and shows 4x improved sample efficiency over rejection sampling.

Conclusion: Fun-DDPS provides an effective generative framework for subsurface flow characterization in CCS, successfully handling extreme data sparsity while maintaining physical consistency and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML adoption grows in sensitive domains, transparency becomes crucial. While XAI methods exist, they often require technical expertise, creating a gap in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI but lack explainability features.

Method: Developed a human-centered XAI module for DashAI (open-source no-code platform) integrating three complementary techniques: Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. Conducted user study with 20 participants (ML novices and experts) to evaluate usability and explanation impact.

Result: High task success (≥80%) across all explainability tasks. Novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on ESS (α=0.74), while experts were more critical of sufficiency/completeness. Explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on TiA scale (α=0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: The study reveals a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML: creating explanations that are both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts. The integrated XAI module successfully improved trust and usability but highlighted different needs across user expertise levels.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

TL;DR: LGS is a two-stage latent generative framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that uses a shared latent physics space and probabilistic dynamics with uncertainty correction, achieving 70× lower FLOPs than baselines while reducing rollout drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems, where traditional neural operators suffer from rollout drift and instability in long-term forecasting. There's a need for scalable, uncertainty-aware solvers that can handle diverse PDE families while being computationally efficient.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Map diverse PDE states into shared latent physics space using pretrained VAE, (2) Learn probabilistic latent dynamics with Transformer trained by flow matching. Key innovations: uncertainty knob for correcting off-manifold drift, flow forcing to update system descriptors from generated trajectories, and pretraining on 2.5M trajectories across 12 PDE families at 128² resolution.

Result: LGS matches deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. Shows efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow with limited finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows, offering computational efficiency and improved stability through latent space learning and uncertainty correction mechanisms.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

TL;DR: Paper formalizes decision-valued maps and DecisionDB infrastructure for tracking how different data representations affect computational outcomes, enabling deterministic replay and audit of decision persistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can produce different computational outcomes, creating a need to track which representations preserve results vs. change them, and to enable reproducible auditing of these relationships.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate representations with discrete outcomes, and builds DecisionDB infrastructure that logs, replays, and audits these relationships using content-derived identifiers and write-once artifact storage.

Result: Creates a system that partitions representation space into persistence regions (where outcomes are preserved) and boundaries (where outcomes change), with deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers from stored artifacts.

Conclusion: Provides a formal framework and practical infrastructure for treating decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition, enabling reliable tracking of how data representations affect computational outcomes across different contexts.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

### [285] [The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: A Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture for Securing Enterprise AI Estates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
*John M. Willis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PBSAI introduces a multi-agent reference architecture for securing enterprise AI systems, organizing security into 12 domains with bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI governance frameworks (like NIST AI RMF) provide principles but lack implementable architectures for securing complex AI estates - socio-technical systems combining models, agents, data pipelines, and infrastructure in production environments.

Method: PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a 12-domain taxonomy, defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy using shared context envelopes and structured output contracts, and includes a lightweight formal model of agents and ecosystem invariants.

Result: The architecture demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and shows applicability in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments, providing traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees across domains.

Conclusion: PBSAI offers a structured, evidence-centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation of secure AI governance in enterprise and hyperscale environments.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, showing how data annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that suppresses human disagreement and imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the positivistic fallacy in ML that treats human disagreement as noise rather than sociotechnical signal. It aims to expose how current data annotation practices systematically erase diverse human perspectives and impose Western cultural norms as universal "ground truth."

Method: Systematic literature review of 30,897 records from 7 premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS) from 2020-2025. Used tiered keyword filtration to create a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records, manually screened to 346 papers for qualitative synthesis via reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Reveals systemic failures in positional legibility and anchoring bias from model-mediated annotations in human-as-verifier models. Shows how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, enforced by precarious data workers prioritizing compliance over honest subjectivity. Demonstrates the "noisy sensor" fallacy where cultural pluralism is misdiagnosed as random error.

Conclusion: Argues for reclaiming disagreement as essential signal for culturally competent models. Proposes roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift from seeking singular "right" answers to mapping diversity of human experience.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLPO is a bi-level prompt optimization framework that improves multimodal LLM judges for evaluating AI-generated images by converting images to textual representations to overcome context window limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI content evaluation, but aligning them with human judgments is challenging. Supervised fine-tuning is costly and inflexible, while existing auto prompt optimization methods focus on text-only evaluations and don't work well in multimodal settings due to context window constraints limiting visual example processing.

Method: BLPO (Bi-Level Prompt Optimization) converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. It uses a bi-level optimization approach that jointly refines the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of BLPO for improving multimodal LLM-as-a-judge evaluations of AI-generated images.

Conclusion: BLPO provides an efficient alternative to costly supervised fine-tuning for improving multimodal LLM judges, overcoming context window limitations through bi-level optimization of prompts and image-to-text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench is a framework for evaluating LLM-based agent robustness under realistic noisy environments, revealing performance gaps between benchmark and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents perform well on benchmarks but struggle in real-world deployments due to stochasticity and noise that current training/evaluation paradigms overlook. There's a need to systematically evaluate agent robustness under realistic noisy conditions.

Method: 1) Analyze real-world biases/uncertainties and categorize noise into user-noise and tool-noise. 2) Develop automated pipeline to inject controllable noise into existing benchmarks while preserving task solvability. 3) Evaluate diverse models across architectures and parameter scales.

Result: Extensive evaluations reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting current agentic models' sensitivity to realistic environmental perturbations.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench bridges the gap between idealized benchmark settings and real-world deployments by providing systematic evaluation of agent robustness under noisy environments, exposing vulnerabilities in current models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that balances task performance with user engagement by combining behavior enhancement for proactive reasoning with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt to user intentions while excessive human feedback reduces user satisfaction.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (to suppress inefficient/redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations).

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines on multiple tasks from UserRL benchmark suite, achieving comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents.

Conclusion: BAO is an effective framework for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios, successfully addressing the trade-off between task performance and user engagement.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench: A new benchmark for evaluating AI agents in scientific paper replication, focusing on real-world challenges like data retrieval and identifying non-replicable research, with baseline results showing LLM agents struggle with resource retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI paper assessment focus too narrowly on computational reproduction with available code/data, missing real-world challenges like inconsistent data availability, lack of non-replicable examples, and process evaluation rather than just outcomes.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench with human-verified replicable/non-replicable social/behavioral science claims, evaluating AI agents across three stages: 1) extraction/retrieval of replication data, 2) design/execution of computational experiments, 3) interpretation of results. Also develops ReplicatorAgent framework with web search and sandboxed environment tools.

Result: Evaluation across four LLMs shows current agents can design/execute computational experiments effectively but struggle with retrieving necessary resources like new data for replication. Different programming languages and code access levels were tested.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by evaluating the full replication process and including non-replicable research. Current LLM agents need improvement in resource retrieval capabilities for real-world replication tasks.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations, using object-level masking to force interaction reasoning and improve relational understanding in world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric representations alone are insufficient for capturing interaction-dependent dynamics in world models. The paper aims to develop a model that can better understand relational interactions between objects for improved prediction, reasoning, and control.

Method: C-JEPA applies object-level masking to object-centric representations, requiring an object's state to be inferred from other objects. This creates latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects that prevent shortcut solutions and force interaction reasoning.

Result: C-JEPA achieves ~20% absolute improvement in counterfactual reasoning on visual question answering compared to same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, it enables substantially more efficient planning using only 1% of latent input features compared to patch-based models while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: Object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions, making C-JEPA an effective approach for improving relational understanding in world models. The method shows strong empirical gains in both reasoning and control tasks while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity increase, using forward-pass statistics instead of backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but creates substantial inference overhead during autoregressive generation, saturating bandwidth. Existing pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck effectively.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) uses structured pruning that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics, jointly measuring controllability and observability.

Result: Achieves 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2 across models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, rivaling gradient-based methods without backpropagation.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an efficient structured pruning solution for Mamba2 that addresses inference bottlenecks while maintaining model fidelity, offering a practical alternative to gradient-based methods.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChaosBench-Logic is a benchmark testing LLMs' logical reasoning on chaotic dynamical systems using first-order logic, revealing that while LLMs achieve high per-item accuracy, they fail completely on compositional reasoning and show fragile coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at natural language tasks but struggle with precise logical and symbolic reasoning. Chaotic dynamical systems provide a demanding test case because chaos is deterministic but often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity.

Method: Created ChaosBench-Logic benchmark evaluating LLMs across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic ontology. Each system has truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, with 621 questions across seven reasoning categories including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues.

Result: Frontier LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, LLaMA-3 70B) achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy but score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot).

Conclusion: ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing LLM reasoning failures and serves as a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches to improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but remain brittle in domains requiring precise logical and symbolic reasoning. Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot). ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing such failures and a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches that improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: TRACER is a new trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-use interactions that detects critical failure episodes missed by single-shot uncertainty methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination that cause failures in real-world multi-turn interactions.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic/lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on the τ²-bench benchmark for predicting task failure and selective task execution.

Conclusion: TRACER enables earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings by capturing trajectory-level breakdown signals that existing single-shot methods miss.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributionally Robust IGM (DrIGM) to address reliability issues in multi-agent RL caused by environmental uncertainties, providing robust variants of existing value-factorization methods with improved out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized training with decentralized execution in MARL suffers from reliability issues in real-world settings due to environmental uncertainties like sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. The IGM principle's assumptions break down under these uncertainties.

Method: Proposes Distributionally Robust IGM (DrIGM) principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with robust team-optimal joint action. Derives robust individual action values compatible with decentralized execution. Creates DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing architectures (VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that train on robust Q-targets while preserving scalability.

Result: The methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and StarCraft game environment. Provides provable robustness guarantees for the whole system.

Conclusion: DrIGM addresses reliability gaps in MARL for real-world applications by providing robust value-factorization methods that maintain scalability and integrate easily with existing codebases, offering practical solutions for deployment under uncertainty.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data structures, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for compression methods that preserve the original data format while achieving better compression ratios.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning applied to T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences rather than vector representations. Employs off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimize redundancy, and enhance compression efficiency without requiring external grammatical or world knowledge.

Result: Shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. The approach effectively compresses data while preserving token-based structure and semantic integrity.

Conclusion: The RL-based token sequence compression method offers a more robust and practical solution for lossless compression across various applications by leveraging language model latent information without explicit content understanding.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

*Zhengbo Jiao,Shaobo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Wei Wang,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AT-RL selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual tokens via graph clustering, achieving better performance than baseline RLVR with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RLVR for MLLMs, understanding how visual evidence integrates during reasoning remains unclear. The authors investigate cross-modal attention connectivity to reveal how visual grounding occurs in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Analyze multimodal RLVR through cross-modal attention connectivity, discover only ~15% tokens show strong visual-textual coupling. Propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) - lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology.

Result: AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables 32B model to surpass 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2). Consistent gains across STEM, video and general tasks. Training on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming importance of precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by fidelity of cross-modal anchoring. High-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in images, and selective reinforcement of these anchors is key to effective multimodal RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first full-stack benchmark for measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems across internal channels (inter-agent messages, shared memory, tool arguments), revealing that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLMs only measure output leakage, but multi-agent systems create additional privacy risks through internal channels like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments that current benchmarks cannot measure.

Method: Developed AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, featuring a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Tested GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces.

Result: Multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9%. Inter-agent messages leak at 68.8% vs 27.2% on output channel, meaning output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet had lowest leakage rates (3.3% external, 28.1% internal).

Conclusion: Inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems, requiring coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and privacy controls on inter-agent communication. Model-level safety training may help protect internal channels.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI approaches focus on task-specific outputs or static knowledge, but overlook continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling, and learning mechanisms needed for sustained adaptation in dynamic environments.

Method: Human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within sequential reasoning enhanced by parallel learning. Systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material to optimize reasoning organization, scheduling, and evolution.

Result: Experimental results on temperature sensor abnormality detection show 23.9% reduction in average runtime when incorporating internal-process learning.

Conclusion: The framework enables systems to progressively evolve internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability, supporting learning alongside processing and hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanisms.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: INTENT is an inference-time planning framework for budget-constrained tool-augmented LLM agents that uses intention-aware hierarchical world modeling to optimize tool usage under strict monetary constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need to solve multi-step tasks using external tools, but real-world deployments face strict monetary budgets for tool invocations. Direct planning is intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance in tool execution outcomes, and prohibitive exploration costs.

Method: INTENT uses an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage and risk-calibrated costs. It performs inference-time planning to guide decisions online while strictly enforcing hard budget feasibility constraints.

Result: On cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT substantially improves task success over baselines while strictly enforcing budget feasibility. It remains robust under dynamic market shifts including tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT provides an effective framework for budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, addressing the challenges of massive state spaces and high variance through intention-aware hierarchical modeling and inference-time planning.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative modeling for semantic-statistical population synthesis, achieving better alignment with target distributions while maintaining feasibility and diversity through persona conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints but lack semantic understanding of behavioral patterns implicitly present in survey data, creating a gap for semantic-conditioned population generation.

Method: SemaPop-GAN uses a WGAN-GP backbone to integrate LLM-derived persona representations from survey records as semantic conditioning signals, with marginal regularization to enforce alignment with target population marginals.

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning.

Conclusion: The approach enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical fusion, providing a modular foundation for generative population projection systems that integrate individual behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

TL;DR: ARC learns dynamic per-query agent configurations using RL, outperforming fixed templates with 25% higher accuracy and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics for configuration, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute since the same configuration is applied to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts).

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating that dynamic configuration adaptation improves both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

*Jingdi Chen,Hanqing Yang,Zongjun Liu,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) evolution across three paradigms: MARL (learned communication), Emergent Language (structured communication), and LLM-based systems (natural language priors), analyzed through the Five Ws framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems in dynamic, partially observable environments require communication to reduce uncertainty and enable collaboration. There's a need to understand how communication approaches have evolved across different research paradigms and identify design patterns for future hybrid systems.

Method: Uses the "Five Ws" framework (who, what, when, where, why) to analyze multi-agent communication across three major paradigms: 1) Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with learned communication, 2) Emergent Language (EL) for structured communication, and 3) LLM-based systems leveraging natural language priors.

Result: Traces evolution from early hand-designed protocols to end-to-end learned communication in MARL, then to Emergent Language methods, and finally to LLM-based approaches. Highlights trade-offs, design patterns, and unsolved challenges across paradigms.

Conclusion: Future systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration. The Five Ws framework provides a clean way to connect ideas across different research threads and identify practical design patterns.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces modality-aware RL post-training with benchmark annotation, policy optimization, and adaptive curriculum to handle multimodal signals efficiently, reducing variance and improving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RL post-training treats all input signals equally, ignoring task-specific modality requirements. This modality-blind approach increases policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and reduces robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE consists of three components: (1) MAPLE-bench benchmark annotating minimal signal combinations per task, (2) MAPO modality-aware policy optimization that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance, and (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. Systematic analysis establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training by addressing modality-aware training challenges through benchmark annotation, optimized policy training, and adaptive curriculum design.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework for omics-native reasoning where LLMs directly inspect single-cell RNA-seq data and bioinformatics tools through natural language conversations, converting core analyses into step-by-step reasoning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more interpretable, auditable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses by grounding large language models directly in raw omics data rather than relying on pre-processed or summarized information.

Method: Converts core single-cell analyses (cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, transcription-factor targeting) into step-by-step reasoning problems that LLMs must solve, justify, and revise with new evidence. Uses scBench evaluation suite with 9 curated datasets to measure omics-native reasoning capability.

Result: Iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (with o1 model), and Gemini-2.5-Pro reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting. The system generates transparent reasoning traces that explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic.

Conclusion: scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses by grounding LLMs directly in raw omics data, providing a systematic framework for omics-native reasoning with measurable performance improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

*Aman Mehta*

TL;DR: LLM agents show inconsistent behavior across identical task runs, with variance predicting failure rates - consistent agents achieve 80-92% accuracy while inconsistent ones drop to 25-60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when running the same task multiple times, and whether this behavioral consistency correlates with task success.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, analyzing action sequence variance and its correlation with accuracy.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average. Tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks (≥6 unique paths) achieve only 25-60%, a 32-55 percentage point gap. 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: Behavioral inconsistency in LLM agents predicts failure, with early decisions (particularly the first search query) being critical divergence points. Monitoring consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving PDE families require solving each instance independently, incurring massive computational costs. Machine learning PDE solvers offer speed but lack interpretability as they only provide numerical approximations without analytical expressions needed for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Introduces affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among related PDEs, avoiding solving each from scratch.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases show promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by providing efficient, interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic solving.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on mathematical spatial reasoning tasks (below 60% accuracy) while humans achieve over 95% accuracy, revealing a fundamental weakness in current models that needs investigation and improvement.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) MathSpatial-Bench - 2K benchmark problems across 3 categories and 11 subtypes to isolate reasoning from perception; (2) MathSpatial-Corpus - 8K training dataset with verified solutions; (3) MathSpatial-SRT - structured reasoning traces using three atomic operations (Correlate, Constrain, Infer).

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25%, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing a critical gap in current multimodal AI capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new medical alignment paradigm for LLMs that addresses limitations of existing RL approaches in high-stakes medical QA by creating a multi-dimensional alignment matrix and unified optimization mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL alignment methods (RLHF and RL from verifiable rewards) are inadequate for medical QA due to expensive preference annotations, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and inability to handle complex clinical contexts. Medical alignment requires simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, but current approaches suffer from scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.

Method: 1. Construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix with four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. 2. Establish closed loops where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which drives optimizable rewards. 3. Implement unified optimization with Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed robust medical alignment paradigm successfully addresses the limitations of existing RL approaches for medical QA by providing fine-grained supervision signals and resolving optimization conflicts, creating a viable framework for high-stakes vertical domain alignment.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

*E Fan,Lisong Shi,Zhengtong Li,Chih-yung Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic agentic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to address the semantic-physical disconnect in autonomous CFD agents, achieving 96% relative improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD struggle with enforcing strict conservation laws and numerical stability due to their probabilistic nature, leading to physically invalid configurations through "context poisoning" from purely semantic RAG approaches.

Method: PhyNiKCE employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, using a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions to rigidly enforce physical constraints.

Result: Validated through OpenFOAM experiments on practical CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE shows 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, reduces autonomous self-correction loops by 59%, and lowers LLM token consumption by 17%.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in autonomous CFD agents, offering a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy AI in broader industrial automation beyond CFD applications.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

*Longyuan Zhu,Hairan Hua,Linlin Miao,Bing Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a data-driven framework to audit evaluation benchmarks across three axes: capability discrimination, anti-saturation, and impact, addressing the unreliability of current LLM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks are becoming unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, creating uncertainty about which evaluation results remain trustworthy in the rapidly advancing field.

Method: Developed BHI framework with three orthogonal axes: (1) Capability Discrimination (separating model performance beyond noise), (2) Anti-Saturation (estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects), and (3) Impact (quantifying influence across ecosystems). Analyzed 106 benchmarks from 91 representative models' technical reports in 2025.

Result: Systematically characterized the evaluation landscape and created the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, enabling principled benchmark selection and dynamic lifecycle management.

Conclusion: BHI provides a principled, data-driven approach to benchmark auditing that addresses current reliability issues and enables better evaluation protocol management for next-generation LLM assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [313] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies "Rung Collapse" as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models learn associations instead of interventions, leading to "Aleatoric Entrenchment" where correct outcomes reinforce flawed reasoning. The authors propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) to penalize causal reasoning errors independently of task success, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift - being "right for the wrong reasons." This pathology stems from autoregressive training's inability to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure formalized as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers from incorrect causal models, agents become entrenched in flawed reasoning (Aleatoric Entrenchment).

Method: Propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. Implement a three-layer architecture with: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem proving actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates; (3) a failure mode taxonomy classifying recurring reasoning errors with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Theoretical: prove asymptotic recovery of true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experimental: on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs, Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2). Steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction. Targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

Conclusion: Rung Collapse is a fundamental limitation of autoregressive training that causes models to learn associations rather than interventions, leading to Aleatoric Entrenchment. ERM provides a principled solution by separating causal reasoning evaluation from outcome success, with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness in recovering entrenched errors that standard feedback cannot address.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs to address structural blindness in MLLMs, achieving large accuracy gains on electrical compliance checks while MLLMs perform near chance level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Conclusion: Structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains, highlighting the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit token-based reasoning and latent reasoning based on model confidence, improving accuracy while reducing generation length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies that latent reasoning effectiveness varies, and analysis shows incorrect reasoning trajectories contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones. Soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives may introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter is an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism that routes thinking to discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to latent space otherwise, dynamically balancing between explicit and latent reasoning.

Result: ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks, achieving average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1 while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter effectively calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning, accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence, and provides an efficient confidence-aware routing approach for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses sparse, distribution-aware updates with reverse KL divergence to reduce interference and improve generation stability compared to existing parameter-space heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: SCF-RKL measures functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates, preserving stable representations while integrating new capabilities.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods across 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety, while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL provides an effective model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse complementary fusion, enabling better integration of specialized models without costly retraining.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First application of crosscoders for cross-architecture model diffing, introducing Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) to better isolate unique model features, enabling unsupervised discovery of safety-critical behaviors like political alignment and copyright refusal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model diffing methods are limited to comparing base models with their finetunes, but new LLM releases often use novel architectures, requiring cross-architecture approaches for wider applicability in identifying safety-critical behaviors.

Method: Introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification to crosscoders that better isolates features unique to one model, enabling unsupervised cross-architecture model diffing between different model architectures.

Result: Successfully identified meaningful behavioral differences including: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing with DFCs is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, establishing it as a valuable tool for safety analysis across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems, featuring 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains with multi-GQL support and a novel evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-GQL datasets are limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, and evaluation scope, hindering systematic advancement of LLM-based graph query systems.

Method: Developed Text2GQL-Bench with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets across different domains, question abstraction levels, and graph query languages using heterogeneous resources.

Result: Evaluation reveals a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: strong LLMs achieve only 4% execution accuracy zero-shot, but 3-shot prompting raises to ~50% accuracy. A fine-tuned 8B model reaches 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity.

Conclusion: Most performance improvement in ISO-GQL generation comes from exposure to sufficient examples, highlighting the need for comprehensive benchmarks like Text2GQL-Bench to advance Text-to-GQL systems.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is the first incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously detects, contains, and recovers from safety incidents while synthesizing guardrail rules to prevent future occurrences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus only on preventing failures in advance, lacking capabilities to respond to, contain, or recover from incidents after they inevitably occur. There's a need for incident response as a first-class safety mechanism.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for managing incident response lifecycle in LLM agent systems, integrated into the agent's execution loop. It performs: (1) semantic incident detection grounded in environment state and context, (2) guided containment and recovery actions via agent tools, and (3) guardrail rule synthesis during eradication to block similar future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains, with experiments confirming the necessity of AIR's design components and showing timeliness with moderate overhead.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, moving beyond just preventive measures to include post-incident response capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR improves multi-turn RL training by using lightweight tree search during rollout generation to select high-scoring actions, achieving better performance and stability without changing the optimization objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL faces challenges with sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments. Naive trajectory sampling can cause exploitation issues and mode collapse, limiting agent learning effectiveness.

Method: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) performs lightweight tree-style search during training to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. It's optimizer-agnostic and can be instantiated with best-of-N, beam, or shallow lookahead search.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks with a one-time increase in training compute. It works with both PPO and GRPO optimizers.

Conclusion: TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning by moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, complementing existing frameworks and rejection-sampling methods.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven framework for converting probabilistic SDM predictions to binary presence-absence maps by maximizing evaluation metrics, with SSE as a computationally efficient alternative based on expected species richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binarization methods for species distribution models are heuristic and can distort species prevalence and community composition estimates, especially under class imbalance and rarity.

Method: MaxExp framework selects most probable species assemblages by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics without calibration data. SSE method predicts assemblages based on expected species richness as a computationally efficient alternative.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers simpler competitive performance.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization that address limitations of heuristic thresholding methods.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment in one model, improving conversion rates while maintaining policy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage ad text systems separate generation from performance alignment, causing misaligned objectives and low funnel efficiency. This limits global optimality and advertiser value.

Method: RELATE uses reinforcement learning to integrate generation and alignment in a single end-to-end model. It incorporates conversion-oriented metrics and compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards in policy learning.

Result: Experiments on industrial datasets show RELATE outperforms baselines. Online deployment on a production platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) under strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: RELATE successfully addresses limitations of traditional two-stage systems by unifying generation and alignment, demonstrating robustness and real-world effectiveness for online advertising.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Yihao Liu,Ziyun Zhang,Zile He,Huaqian Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ES framework decouples task execution from workflow construction: first execute task with tools, then reconstruct workflow from traces, improving accuracy over methods that build workflows during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can solve complex tasks using reasoning and tools, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. Current approaches that build workflows during execution suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between solving tasks and constructing workflows.

Method: Execute-Summarize (ES) framework that separates task execution from workflow construction. First, the model completes the task using available tools (execution phase). Then, independently reconstructs a structured workflow from the execution traces (summarization phase). This decoupling prevents interference between the two processes.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on FlowBench through extensive experiments. It provides improved workflow accuracy and robustness compared to prior approaches that build workflows during execution.

Conclusion: The ES framework offers a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows by decoupling execution from workflow construction, addressing the interference problem in prior methods.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems using specialized agents for problem solving, visualization, and narration, achieving massive scale and cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, with limitations in procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent system with Orchestrating Agent coordinating specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) with quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Generates structured executable video scripts compiled into synchronized visuals/narration using template-driven assembly.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding 1 million videos per day with over 95% cost reduction compared to industry standards while maintaining high acceptance rate.

Conclusion: LAVES addresses limitations of prior video generation approaches by decomposing workflow into specialized agents with quality controls, enabling scalable, cost-effective production of logically rigorous educational videos.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

### [325] [Detecting RLVR Training Data via Structural Convergence of Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11792)
*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Min-kNN Distance, a black-box detector for identifying RLVR contamination by measuring generation diversity collapse in RL-trained reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training creates benchmark contamination concerns because it fine-tunes models using reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods ineffective. There's a need for methods to detect whether prompts were seen during RLVR training.

Method: Introduces Min-kNN Distance detector that samples multiple completions for a given prompt and computes average of k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. This quantifies the behavioral signature where RLVR training causes seen prompts to generate more rigid/similar completions while unseen prompts retain diversity.

Result: Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models, outperforming existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective black-box detection approach for RLVR contamination that requires no access to reference models or token probabilities, addressing a critical gap in evaluating reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

### [326] [Hi-SAM: A Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal Framework for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11799)
*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM: Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework for recommendation that addresses tokenization redundancy and architecture-data mismatch through disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical transformer design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal recommendation approaches have two key limitations: (1) suboptimal tokenization where methods like RQ-VAE fail to disentangle shared cross-modal semantics from modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse, and (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchical nature of user interactions, items, and tokens.

Method: Two main components: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and uses coarse-to-fine quantization with shared codebooks for consensus and modality-specific codebooks for nuances, enforced by mutual information minimization. (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy, and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory while retaining details for current items.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing multi-modal recommendation approaches by introducing hierarchical structure awareness and disentangled semantic tokenization, leading to significant performance improvements in both offline experiments and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR: A scalable preflight planning method for large UAV fleets in dynamic airspace with temporal No-Fly Zones, using prioritized planning with iterative conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-Agent Path Finding methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management with large UAV fleets, temporal NFZs, heterogeneous vehicles, and strict delivery deadlines.

Method: Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution: 1) Prioritize missions by urgency, 2) Use SFIPP-ST (4D single-agent planner) for roundtrip trajectories with soft conflict constraints, 3) Iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by geometric conflict graph resolves residual conflicts, 4) Completeness-preserving directional pruning accelerates 3D search.

Result: Achieves near-100% success with fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search, and scales successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR is a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace, positioned to handle real-world UTM challenges effectively.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves weather forecasting by addressing limited diffusability in latent diffusion models through 3D-MAE encoding and variable-aware spectral regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models struggle with limited diffusability in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to lack of task-agnostic foundation models, absence of explicit semantic structures in meteorological fields, and inappropriate homogeneous spectral regularization that doesn't account for inter-variable spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning for the diffusion model, and 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on each variable's spectral energy distribution.

Result: PuYun-LDM enhances latent diffusability, achieves superior performance to ENS (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) at short lead times while remaining comparable at longer horizons, generates 15-day global forecasts with 6-hour resolution in 5 minutes on a single H200 GPU, and enables efficient parallel ensemble forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses diffusability limitations in weather forecasting LDMs through specialized conditioning and variable-aware regularization, enabling high-performance, computationally efficient ensemble weather predictions.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

TL;DR: A lightweight framework using internal hidden states for efficient sequence length prediction in LLM serving, reducing padding waste with entropy-guided pooling and progressive prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed sequence length distributions in LLM serving and RL sampling cause significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods using auxiliary models have high overhead, poor generalization, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: Introduces a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for length prediction. Two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) - uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) - dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation.

Result: Built ForeLen benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16% over best baseline. Integration with length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: Provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference, offering lightweight solution to reduce padding waste in batched inference through reuse of model's internal states for accurate length prediction.

Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction.

To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS is a training-free framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination because visual features and pretrained textual representations become intertwined in deeper network layers, suppressing visual information.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information vectors from latent space geometry, then performs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs, without requiring training.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines on standard benchmarks while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through precise geometric interventions, offering significant performance improvements with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a new transformer architecture using prototypes instead of self-attention, offering linear scaling, interpretable reasoning through nameable concepts, and competitive performance while enabling targeted model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models have opaque reasoning processes that undermine trust and introduce risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for interpretable architectures that maintain performance while providing transparency into the model's decision-making.

Method: ProtoT replaces standard self-attention with prototype-based communication. It uses parameter vectors (prototypes) that engage in two-way communication with input sequences, automatically capturing nameable concepts during training and creating interpretable communication channels.

Result: ProtoT achieves linear scaling with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs competitively on text generation and GLUE tasks, shows robustness to input perturbations, and provides interpretable pathways showing how robustness/sensitivity arises.

Conclusion: ProtoT demonstrates that interpretable-by-design autoregressive language models can achieve near state-of-the-art performance while offering transparency, enabling targeted edits, and providing insights into model reasoning and robustness mechanisms.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

TL;DR: VRCsim simulation framework generates VRC cooperative perception data, enabling creation of VRC-QA dataset and Talk2DM module for natural language querying in dynamic maps for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic maps lack natural-language-supported human interfaces, limiting human-DM interaction despite their success in Japan. Current systems need better querying and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Developed VRCsim simulation framework for streaming VRC-CP data generation, created VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying/reasoning, and built Talk2DM with chain-of-prompt mechanism integrating human rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy with 2-5 second response time using various LLMs (Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, GPT-oss), showing strong generalization and practical potential despite larger models having efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully extends VRC-DM systems with natural language querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities, demonstrating plug-and-play functionality and strong practical applicability for vehicle-road-cloud cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI delegation methods rely on simple heuristics and cannot adapt to environmental changes or handle unexpected failures robustly, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle complex tasks through meaningful decomposition and safe delegation.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation as a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, incorporating transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications, intent clarity, and trust mechanisms.

Result: The framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex delegation networks and aims to inform development of protocols for the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: An adaptive delegation framework is needed to enable AI agents to meaningfully decompose complex problems and safely delegate across networks, addressing current limitations of heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

TL;DR: HSAE (Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder) learns hierarchical feature structures from LLMs by jointly training multiple SAEs with parent-child relationships, using structural constraints and feature perturbation to capture multi-scale conceptual organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders extract isolated features from LLMs, but evidence suggests language has intrinsic hierarchical structure (e.g., "feature splitting"). Current methods don't capture this multi-scale organization of concepts.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) that jointly learns multiple SAEs with parent-child relationships. Uses two novel mechanisms: structural constraint loss to align parent-child features, and random feature perturbation mechanism.

Result: HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies across various LLMs and layers, validated by both qualitative case studies and quantitative metrics. Maintains reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures in LLM representations, capturing the hierarchical nature of language organization that standard SAEs miss.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) framework enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by replacing uncertain detailed content with higher-confidence, less specific abstractions instead of completely abstaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to factual errors that limit adoption in high-risk settings. Current uncertainty estimation approaches use binary "all-or-nothing" abstention, which is too restrictive in long-form generation and discards valuable information.

Method: Proposed Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Implemented Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal.

Conclusion: Reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of the original meaning, offering a better alternative to complete abstention for uncertain content in long-form generation.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha factor mining as strategic navigation of a DAG, using Bayesian retrieval and DAG-aware generation to outperform existing methods in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha factor mining methods lack global structural view, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity. Current paradigms (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) fail to capture the interconnected nature of factor evolution.

Method: AlphaPROBE models factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It has two core components: 1) Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation/exploration through posterior probability model, and 2) DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines show AlphaPROBE significantly outperforms in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency. Results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

Conclusion: AlphaPROBE demonstrates that treating factor pools as dynamic, interconnected ecosystems through DAG modeling enables more efficient and diverse alpha discovery compared to existing paradigms. The framework provides a principled approach to automated factor mining with superior performance.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEME is a novel LLM-based framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of investment narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in Chinese stock markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM methods in finance focus on individual stock prediction or portfolio allocation without understanding the underlying reasoning driving market movements. There's a need to model markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment narratives.

Method: MEME uses a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into Investment Arguments, applies Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus in semantic space, and implements temporal evaluation/alignment to track mode lifecycles and historical profitability.

Result: MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines across three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023-2025. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case studies, and cost analysis validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MEME successfully models financial markets as evolutionary ecosystems of investment narratives, prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, and demonstrates superior performance in identifying and adapting to evolving market consensus.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic asynchronous environments with temporal constraints, dynamic events, and collaboration requirements, featuring action-level evaluation for RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations are static or synchronous, lacking realistic asynchronous environments where agents must handle temporal constraints, noisy events, ambiguity, and collaboration - creating a "sim2real" gap.

Method: Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments platform, Gaia2 creates scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, paired with write-action verifiers for fine-grained evaluation and RL training.

Result: Evaluation shows no model dominates: GPT-5 leads with 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 trades accuracy/speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads open-source at 21% pass@1, revealing trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness.

Conclusion: Gaia2 exposes fundamental challenges in agent development and the sim2real gap. By releasing Gaia2 with the ARE framework, the authors provide flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation focus on realism and diversity but fail to assess whether generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology, which is crucial for safe healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval) framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their conditioning prompts.

Result: CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and shows correlation with expert judgment, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing clinically relevant semantic alignment.

Conclusion: CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

*Xiuping Wu,Zhao Yu,Yuxin Cheng,Ngai Wong,Liangjun Ke,Tapas Mishra,Konstantinos V. Katsikopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from LLM reasoning to enhance performance on reasoning tasks without updating model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving LLM reasoning through prompt adjustment are largely intuitive and lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral pattern perspective.

Method: Two optimization methods: 1) InjectCorrect - guides models by imitating behavioral patterns from their own past correct answers; 2) InjectRLOpt - learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses a Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference to steer reasoning.

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter updates, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types, and structurally injecting these patterns can significantly influence reasoning quality. The proposed parameter-free methods effectively leverage behavioral patterns to enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

TL;DR: LawThinker is an autonomous legal research agent that uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with atomic verification after each knowledge exploration step to ensure procedurally compliant legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. There's a need for systems that ensure both correct outcomes and procedurally compliant reasoning processes.

Method: LawThinker adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance. It includes a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks confirm its generalization capability.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the verification gap in legal reasoning by enforcing atomic verification after every knowledge exploration step, leading to significant performance improvements in both dynamic and static legal reasoning environments.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics.

*Wenlong Wang,Fergal Reid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mamba-2 hybrid operators in recursive reasoning models improve solution coverage while maintaining top-1 performance, establishing SSM-based operators as viable for recursive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Mamba-2's state space recurrence, which is itself a form of iterative refinement, can preserve reasoning capability when introduced into recursive reasoning scaffolds like TRM.

Method: Replace Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters), then evaluate on ARC-AGI-1 benchmark.

Result: Hybrid improves pass@2 by +2.0% (45.88% vs 43.88%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75% at pass@100), while maintaining pass@1 parity, suggesting improved candidate coverage.

Conclusion: Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within recursive scaffolds, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in recursive operator design space and providing insights for mixing strategies.

Abstract: Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data for debugging multi-agent AI systems, implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multi-agent AI systems become more complex (from chatbots to autonomous swarms), debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation - precisely what modal logic formalizes, but traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) that can learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone. The framework covers four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (event causality), deontic (permitted actions), and doxastic (agent confidence interpretation).

Result: The approach enables interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters (not opaque embeddings), knowledge injection via differentiable axioms for sparse data learning, compositional multi-modal reasoning combining epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints, and practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control, and communication of multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML provides a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework for multi-agent AI systems that can learn modal logic structures from data, making logical contradictions learnable optimization objectives, with demonstrated applications in discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games and detecting LLM hallucinations.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: StateLM introduces foundation models with internal reasoning loops and memory tools to actively manage context, breaking free from fixed window limitations and achieving significant performance gains on long-document QA, chat memory, and research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack agency to actively manage their own memory/context like Dumbledore using a Pensieve in Harry Potter. They're limited to passively accepting manually engineered context within fixed architectural windows, preventing dynamic memory management.

Method: Introduces StateLM with internal reasoning loops to manage state, equipped with memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking). Trains models to actively use these tools to dynamically engineer their own context.

Result: StateLMs outperform standard LLMs across all model scales on long-document QA. Achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks. On BrowseComp-Plus research task, StateLM reaches 52% accuracy vs ~5% for standard LLMs.

Conclusion: StateLM transforms LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents, making reasoning a stateful and manageable process by giving models agency over their own memory management.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reflections and coordinating length penalties based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate excessively long chains-of-thought with repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, leading to high token consumption, computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models.

Method: ARLCP (Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty) introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem, coordinated through reinforcement learning.

Result: On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models: 1.5B model reduced average response length by 53.1% while improving accuracy by 5.8%; 7B model achieved 35.0% length reduction with 2.7% accuracy gain.

Conclusion: ARLCP achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy through coordinated penalties, making Large Reasoning Models more practical and efficient.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSFMs with leakage-safe covariates and IOCI perform comparably to classical methods for university enrolment forecasting without institution-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and need accurate enrolment forecasts, but traditional methods struggle with short data series, structural breaks, and reporting changes.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting with compact, leakage-safe covariates; introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) from documentary evidence and Google Trends proxies with stabilizing feature engineering; use expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance varying by cohort and model.

Conclusion: TSFMs with carefully constructed covariates can provide reliable enrolment forecasts in data-sparse settings, offering a viable alternative to classical methods.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

### [347] [HLA: Hadamard Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12128)
*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLA (Hadamard Linear Attention) is a new linear attention method that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities, using higher-degree rational functions to better approximate softmax attention, with efficient computation and no tensor reshaping needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers is computationally expensive, especially for applications with large token counts like video generation. Existing linear attention methods use low-degree rational approximations of softmax that apply nonlinearity separately to queries and keys, which may limit their approximation quality.

Method: Proposes Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) which differs from previous linear attention by applying nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (like standard softmax attention), resulting in higher-degree rational function approximations of softmax. The method maintains efficient computational schemes similar to standard linear attention without requiring tensor reshaping operations.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness when applied to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves processing very large amounts of tokens where computational efficiency is critical.

Conclusion: HLA provides a more accurate approximation of softmax attention than previous linear attention methods while maintaining computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for large-scale applications like video generation with transformers.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commercial AI image generators show strong demographic biases: both favor white skin tones (>96%), but diverge on gender - Gemini favors females, GPT favors males with lighter skin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone biases in widely deployed models.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts with Gemini Flash 2.5 Image and GPT Image 1.5. Used hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification (Monk/MST, PERLA, Fitzpatrick scales).

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models showed strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). Gender bias diverged - Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing systemic biases. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

### [349] [Value Alignment Tax: Measuring Value Trade-offs in LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12134)
*Jiajun Chen,Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework measuring how alignment interventions (like prompting or fine-tuning) affect interconnected values beyond just the target value, revealing systemic alignment risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current value alignment approaches treat values statically and only measure on-target improvements, ignoring how alignment interventions reshape the broader value system and create unintended consequences across interconnected values.

Method: Introduced VAT framework to measure alignment-induced value changes; used controlled scenario-action dataset based on Schwartz value theory; collected paired pre-post normative judgments; analyzed effects across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values; these systemic effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation; reveals process-level alignment risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: VAT framework reveals hidden systemic risks in value alignment, showing that alignment interventions reshape entire value systems in structured ways, requiring broader evaluation beyond target-only metrics.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

*Xiaoxiao Wang,Chunxiao Li,Junying Wang,Yijin Guo,Zijian Chen,Chunyi Li,Xiaohong Liu,Zicheng Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR framework bridges statistical expectations with agentic reasoning to predict model performance from limited observations, outperforming baselines with 14.46% improvement under extreme sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive large model evaluation is prohibitively expensive, and existing methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR combines data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning. It uses specialized retrievers for external knowledge, embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) for statistical expectations with uncertainty, and employs a reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) for refinement through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, achieving a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity with only 1-2 observed scores per test model.

Conclusion: The STAR framework successfully bridges statistical and knowledge-driven approaches to enable accurate model performance prediction from limited observations, providing traceable explanations while handling pattern shifts and data sparsity challenges.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

*John Muchovej,Amanda Royka,Shane Lee,Julian Jara-Ettinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show social proficiency but lack a coherent, domain-general Theory of Mind when tested with cognitively-grounded evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs truly possess Theory of Mind (ToM) beyond just performing well on social benchmarks, by testing whether they have actual causal mental state representations.

Method: Developed a new evaluation framework based on cognitive science definition of ToM, testing whether LLMs have coherent, domain-general, consistent causal models of how mental states cause behavior, regardless of human-like accuracy.

Result: LLMs succeed at approximating human judgments in simple ToM tasks but fail at logically equivalent tasks and show low consistency between action predictions and mental state inferences.

Conclusion: LLMs' social proficiency does not stem from a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind, suggesting they lack the causal mental state representations posited by ToM theory.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

*Xiaohan He,Shiyang Feng,Songtao Huang,Lei Bai,Bin Wang,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sci-CoE is a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve as both solver and verifier, transitioning from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning to enhance scientific reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning capabilities but remain fragile in scientific reasoning tasks due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use small annotated dataset to establish correctness judgment anchors for Verifier; 2) Introduce geometric reward mechanism considering consensus, reliability, and diversity to drive large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate enhanced complex reasoning capabilities and strong scalability, facilitating more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE enables LLMs to self-evolve effectively in scientific reasoning tasks, addressing evaluation reliability and strategy diversity issues through a novel co-evolving framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

### [353] [Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170)
*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks (QBBN) with negation and natural language parsing, creating a complete logical reasoning system that combines LLMs for preprocessing with formal grammars and probabilistic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous QBBN work lacked negation/backward reasoning capabilities and natural language parsing. This paper aims to create a complete logical reasoning system that bridges formal semantics with modern NLP approaches, addressing the limitations of pure LLM-based parsing while leveraging their strengths.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors for negation (P(x) + P(neg x) = 1), enabling contrapositive reasoning via backward lambda messages. Introduces typed logical language with role-labeled predicates and modal quantifiers. Develops typed slot grammar for deterministic sentence compilation to logical form. Uses LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation, grammar for parsing, LLM reranking, and QBBN for inference.

Result: QBBN engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. Grammar compiles sentences to logical form with 33/33 correct, zero ambiguity. LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy for disambiguation but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming grammars are necessary.

Conclusion: The system reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" by using LLMs to eliminate annotation bottlenecks while maintaining formal verification through QBBNs. This hybrid approach leverages LLMs as annotators and QBBNs as verifiers, creating a practical bridge between traditional formal NLP and modern statistical methods.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

*Bowei He,Yankai Chen,Xiaokun Zhang,Linghe Kong,Philip S. Yu,Xue Liu,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pedagogically-inspired framework (IOA) for LLM knowledge distillation that uses educational principles to systematically transfer knowledge from large to small models through progressive curricula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off task rather than a systematic learning process, which limits effective knowledge transfer from large to small models.

Method: Three-stage IOA pipeline: Knowledge Identifier (finds student deficiencies), Organizer (creates progressive curricula using Bloom's Mastery Learning and Vygotsky's ZPD), and Adapter (adjusts representations to student capacity).

Result: Student models achieve 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval with <1/10th parameters, plus 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: Educational principles can significantly enhance LLM distillation, particularly for complex reasoning tasks, making the IOA framework an effective approach for deploying efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder size by 88% while maintaining segmentation performance by replacing SAM3's large text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student via knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large, general-purpose text encoders designed for open-ended language understanding, but segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to computational and memory overhead due to over-provisioning.

Method: 1) Large-scale analysis of 404,796 real prompts revealing redundancy in context window usage, vocabulary sparsity, and low-dimensional embedding manifolds; 2) Proposed SAM3-LiteText framework replacing original SAM3 text encoder with compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to original SAM3 on image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that segmentation-specific text encoders can be significantly compressed without performance loss, addressing the computational inefficiency of using general-purpose language models for vision-language segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes street name transcriptions with 44% error rate, disproportionately affecting non-English speakers. Synthetic data generation with TTS models improves accuracy by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite low word error rates on benchmarks, speech recognition systems fail in real-world high-stakes scenarios like street name transcription, causing systematic errors that disproportionately affect non-English speakers.

Method: Evaluated 15 commercial models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers. Introduced synthetic data generation using open-source text-to-speech models to create diverse pronunciations of named entities, then fine-tuned with <1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% on street names. Routing distance errors were twice as large for non-English primary speakers. Fine-tuning with synthetic data improved street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% relative to base models for non-English speakers.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems. Synthetic data generation provides a simple, scalable solution to reduce high-stakes transcription errors and address disparities affecting non-English speakers.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

*Jianke Yang,Ohm Venkatachalam,Mohammad Kianezhad,Sharvaree Vadgama,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based framework that mimics scientific reasoning by first extracting physical properties, then using them to guide symbolic regression for equation discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based equation discovery systems guess equations directly from data without modeling the multi-step scientific reasoning process that involves first inferring physical properties like symmetries, then using these as priors to constrain candidate equations.

Method: KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure (physical properties), then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines like PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the scientific reasoning process (inferring physical properties first, then using them as priors) leads to more accurate and robust symbolic equation discovery compared to direct guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework that uses checklist rewards instead of verifiable outcome rewards to optimize multi-turn, multi-step AI agents for tool use, achieving significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying reinforcement learning to real-world AI agents is difficult because: 1) realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, 2) RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is underexplored, and 3) building/maintaining executable tool environments is costly and limits scale.

Method: CM2 replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards that decompose each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata. It uses sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria for balance. Training occurs in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment to avoid heavy engineering for large tool sets.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model trained on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over SFT counterpart by: 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox. Results match or outperform similarly sized open-source baselines including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, demonstrating consistent improvements over supervised fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage compared to uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior on multi-step agentic tasks is poorly understood. Uniform per-step compute allocation shows diminishing returns in long-horizon environments, and small errors can compound over time.

Method: CATTS (Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling) uses uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) to dynamically allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. It avoids uniform scaling by focusing compute on uncertain steps.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. It provides both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

Conclusion: Dynamic compute allocation based on vote-derived uncertainty is effective for multi-step agents, outperforming uniform scaling strategies while being more efficient. The approach offers a practical way to balance performance and computational cost in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
