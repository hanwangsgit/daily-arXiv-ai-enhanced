Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldVQA is a new benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' atomic visual world knowledge by decoupling visual knowledge retrieval from reasoning, focusing strictly on what models memorize about visual entities across a stratified taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations often conflate visual knowledge retrieval with reasoning, making it difficult to measure pure visual factuality. There's a need for a benchmark that strictly assesses what models memorize about visual entities to establish standards for evaluating encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates.

Method: WorldVQA decouples visual knowledge retrieval from reasoning by focusing on atomic capabilities of grounding and naming visual entities. It uses a stratified taxonomy that spans from common head-class objects to long-tail rarities to comprehensively assess visual world knowledge.

Result: The paper introduces the WorldVQA benchmark itself as the main result, providing a tool for rigorous testing of visual factuality in MLLMs.

Conclusion: WorldVQA establishes a standard for assessing the encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates of current and next-generation frontier models, serving as a rigorous test for visual factuality that separates memorization from reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce WorldVQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the atomic visual world knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike current evaluations, which often conflate visual knowledge retrieval with reasoning, WorldVQA decouples these capabilities to strictly measure "what the model memorizes." The benchmark assesses the atomic capability of grounding and naming visual entities across a stratified taxonomy, spanning from common head-class objects to long-tail rarities. We expect WorldVQA to serve as a rigorous test for visual factuality, thereby establishing a standard for assessing the encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates of current and next-generation frontier models.

*Xintong Zhang,Xiaowen Zhang,Jongrong Wu,Zhi Gao,Shilin Yan,Zhenxin Diao,Kunpeng Gao,Xuanyan Chen,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptMMBench is a new benchmark for evaluating adaptive multimodal reasoning in VLMs, focusing on dynamic difficulty assessment and mode selection rationality across five domains, using MCC metrics to isolate meta-cognition abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for adaptive multimodal reasoning rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics that fail to capture dynamic difficulty relative to model capacities, obscuring the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses.

Method: Proposes AdaptMMBench benchmark across five domains (real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, math) with both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. Uses Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate selection rationality of reasoning modes by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Enables multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency.

Result: Evaluation reveals that adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity but notably decouples from final accuracy. Key step coverage aligns with performance, while tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.

Conclusion: AdaptMMBench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating adaptive multimodal reasoning that isolates meta-cognition abilities and enables fine-grained process analysis, revealing important insights about how different aspects of reasoning performance relate to each other.

Abstract: Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.

*Jinglun Yu,Yaning Wang,Wenhan Guo,Yuan Gao,Yu Sun,Jin U. Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for inverse scattering in OCT that jointly recovers optical parameters and structural images using physics-informed supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse scattering in OCT is challenging due to attenuation, speckle noise, and parameter coupling, but recovering both structural images and intrinsic tissue optical properties (refractive index, scattering coefficient, anisotropy) is valuable for quantitative tissue characterization.

Method: Regularized end-to-end deep learning framework trained with Monte Carlo-simulated ground truth, incorporating a physics-based OCT forward model that generates predicted signals from estimated parameters for physics-consistent supervision.

Result: Experiments on synthetic corneal OCT dataset show robust optical map recovery under noise, improved resolution, and enhanced structural fidelity compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The approach enables quantitative multi-parameter tissue characterization and demonstrates the benefit of combining physics-informed modeling with deep learning for computational OCT.

Abstract: Inverse scattering in optical coherence tomography (OCT) seeks to recover both structural images and intrinsic tissue optical properties, including refractive index, scattering coefficient, and anisotropy. This inverse problem is challenging due to attenuation, speckle noise, and strong coupling among parameters. We propose a regularized end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly reconstructs optical parameter maps and speckle-reduced OCT structural intensity for layer visualization. Trained with Monte Carlo-simulated ground truth, our network incorporates a physics-based OCT forward model that generates predicted signals from the estimated parameters, providing physics-consistent supervision for parameter recovery and artifact suppression. Experiments on the synthetic corneal OCT dataset demonstrate robust optical map recovery under noise, improved resolution, and enhanced structural fidelity. This approach enables quantitative multi-parameter tissue characterization and highlights the benefit of combining physics-informed modeling with deep learning for computational OCT.

*Haruhiko Murata,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVD-ViT uses singular value decomposition to help Vision Transformers focus on foreground features while suppressing background noise, improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack explicit mechanisms to distinguish foreground from background, causing them to learn unnecessary background features and artifacts that degrade classification performance.

Method: Proposes SVD-ViT with three components: SPC module, SSVA, and ID-RSVD, which use singular value decomposition to extract and aggregate singular vectors capturing foreground information while suppressing task-irrelevant background noise.

Result: Experimental results show improved classification accuracy and effective learning of informative foreground representations while reducing background noise impact.

Conclusion: SVD-ViT successfully addresses ViT's foreground-background discrimination limitation through SVD-based feature prioritization, enhancing classification performance by focusing on relevant object features.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have been established as large-scale foundation models. However, because self-attention operates globally, they lack an explicit mechanism to distinguish foreground from background. As a result, ViT may learn unnecessary background features and artifacts, leading to degraded classification performance. To address this issue, we propose SVD-ViT, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to prioritize the learning of foreground features. SVD-ViT consists of three components-\textbf{SPC module}, \textbf{SSVA}, and \textbf{ID-RSVD}-and suppresses task-irrelevant factors such as background noise and artifacts by extracting and aggregating singular vectors that capture object foreground information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves classification accuracy and effectively learns informative foreground representations while reducing the impact of background noise.

### [5] [LmPT: Conditional Point Transformer for Anatomical Landmark Detection on 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02808)
*Matteo Bastico,Pierre Onghena,David Ryckelynck,Beatriz Marcotegui,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Laurent Corté,Caroline Robine--Decourcelle,Etienne Decencière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LmPT is a transformer-based method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that enables cross-species learning between human and dog femurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmarking is time-consuming and variable, while rule-based methods are limited to specific geometries or landmarks. There's a need for automatic methods that can work across different species for translational research.

Method: Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT) uses point cloud representation of anatomical surfaces with a conditioning mechanism for adaptability to different input types, enabling cross-species learning.

Result: The method was evaluated on femoral landmarking using both human and newly annotated dog femurs, demonstrating generalization and effectiveness across species.

Conclusion: LmPT provides an effective solution for automatic anatomical landmark detection that can leverage homologous bones from different species, advancing translational research capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate identification of anatomical landmarks is crucial for various medical applications. Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning. We focus the evaluation of our approach on femoral landmarking using both human and newly annotated dog femurs, demonstrating its generalization and effectiveness across species. The code and dog femur dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Pierreoo/LandmarkPointTransformer.

### [6] [Self-Supervised Uncalibrated Multi-View Video Anonymization in the Operating Room](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02850)
*Keqi Chen,Vinkle Srivastav,Armine Vardazaryan,Cindy Rolland,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework for operating rooms that achieves over 97% recall without manual annotations or camera calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation is essential for OR research using video data, but existing anonymization methods face scalability issues: requiring manual annotations for each new clinical site and needing camera calibration whenever cameras are repositioned in multi-view setups.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised framework with whole-body person detection and pose estimation. Uses temporal and multi-view context to retrieve false negatives from low-score detections, then applies self-supervised domain adaptation. Iteratively fine-tunes detectors using recovered detections as pseudo labels, and fine-tunes pose models using their own high-score predictions.

Result: Achieves over 97% recall on both simulated (4D-OR dataset) and real surgery datasets. Also trains a real-time whole-body detector using pseudo labels that achieves comparable performance, demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework effectively addresses scalability bottlenecks in OR video anonymization by eliminating the need for manual annotations and camera calibration while maintaining high detection accuracy.

Abstract: Privacy preservation is a prerequisite for using video data in Operating Room (OR) research. Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by "retrieving" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability. Code is available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/OR_anonymization.

### [7] [ViThinker: Active Vision-Language Reasoning via Dynamic Perceptual Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02873)
*Weihang You,Qingchan Zhu,David Liu,Yi Pan,Geng Yuan,Hanqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViThinker enables vision-language models to actively query visual features on demand during reasoning, outperforming passive CoT methods by generating decision tokens that trigger expert-aligned visual feature synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought reasoning in vision-language models suffers from premature visual-to-text conversion that discards continuous spatial information, and existing enhancement methods remain passive by processing pre-computed inputs rather than actively seeking task-relevant details.

Method: ViThinker framework enables models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens that trigger synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand. It uses a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties to discover minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step.

Result: Evaluations across vision-centric benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, validating that active query generation outperforms passive approaches in both perceptual grounding and reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Active perception through on-demand visual feature querying enables more effective vision-language reasoning than passive CoT approaches, with ViThinker successfully internalizing vision-expert capabilities and performing generative mental simulation during inference.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excels in language models but struggles in vision-language models due to premature visual-to-text conversion that discards continuous information such as geometry and spatial layout. While recent methods enhance CoT through static enumeration or attention-based selection, they remain passive, i.e., processing pre-computed inputs rather than actively seeking task-relevant details. Inspired by human active perception, we introduce ViThinker, a framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens triggering the synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand. ViThinker internalizes vision-expert capabilities during training, performing generative mental simulation during inference without external tool calls. Through a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties, i.e., ViThinker discovers minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step. Evaluations across vision-centric benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, validating that active query generation outperforms passive approaches in both perceptual grounding and reasoning accuracy.

### [8] [DoubleTake: Contrastive Reasoning for Faithful Decision-Making in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02894)
*Daivik Patel,Shrenik Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contrastive document-aware reference selection framework for medical imaging that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity, improving accuracy by 15% on MediConfusion benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical imaging approaches rely on nearest neighbor retrieval that returns redundant evidence and reinforces single hypotheses, failing to reason over subtle visual differences between confusable conditions.

Method: Introduces a contrastive document-aware reference selection framework that balances visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. Proposes Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference with structured pairwise visual comparisons and margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MediConfusion benchmark, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning and demonstrates that contrastive evidence sets with structured pairwise comparisons significantly improve decision-making accuracy in medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate decision making in medical imaging requires reasoning over subtle visual differences between confusable conditions, yet most existing approaches rely on nearest neighbor retrieval that returns redundant evidence and reinforces a single hypothesis. We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention. On the MediConfusion benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.

### [9] [FaceLinkGen: Rethinking Identity Leakage in Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition with Identity Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02914)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) evaluations focus on pixel-level reconstruction resistance, but this approach fails to protect against identity extraction attacks like FaceLinkGen, which can achieve high matching and regeneration accuracy without recovering original pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPFR evaluations primarily measure privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction using metrics like PSNR and SSIM, but this reconstruction-centric view is insufficient for protecting real privacy against identity extraction attacks.

Method: The authors present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. They test this attack on three recent PPFR systems and evaluate it in both standard and near zero knowledge settings.

Result: FaceLinkGen achieves over 98.5% matching accuracy and above 96% regeneration success on three recent PPFR systems. Even in a near zero knowledge setting, it still exceeds 92% matching and 94% regeneration accuracy, demonstrating that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed.

Conclusion: There is a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics (PSNR/SSIM) used in PPFR evaluation and real privacy protection. Visual obfuscation fails to protect identity information from both external intruders and untrusted service providers, necessitating new evaluation approaches for privacy-preserving face recognition.

Abstract: Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\% matching accuracy and above 96\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\% matching and 94\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers.

*Jagan Mohan Reddy Dwarampudi,Joshua Wong,Hien Van Nguyen,Tania Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARBLE is the first purely Mamba-based multi-state MIL framework for WSI analysis, using parallel multi-scale processing with linear-time state-space models to efficiently capture cross-scale dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI analysis is challenging due to gigapixel resolutions and hierarchical magnifications. Existing MIL methods typically operate at single scales, and transformer-based approaches suffer from quadratic attention costs, creating a need for scalable alternatives.

Method: MARBLE uses a purely Mamba-based architecture with parallel multi-scale processing at multiple magnification levels. It integrates coarse-to-fine reasoning within a linear-time state-space model to capture cross-scale dependencies efficiently with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: Experiments on five public datasets show improvements up to 6.9% in AUC, 20.3% in accuracy, and 2.3% in C-index compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MARBLE establishes an efficient and generalizable framework for multi-scale WSI analysis, providing a scalable and modular alternative to attention-based architectures with superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Recurrent Biomedical Linear-time Encoder (MARBLE), the first \textit{purely Mamba-based} multi-state multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. MARBLE processes multiple magnification levels in parallel and integrates coarse-to-fine reasoning within a linear-time state-space model, efficiently capturing cross-scale dependencies with minimal parameter overhead. WSI analysis remains challenging due to gigapixel resolutions and hierarchical magnifications, while existing MIL methods typically operate at a single scale and transformer-based approaches suffer from quadratic attention costs. By coupling parallel multi-scale processing with linear-time sequence modeling, MARBLE provides a scalable and modular alternative to attention-based architectures. Experiments on five public datasets show improvements of up to \textbf{6.9\%} in AUC, \textbf{20.3\%} in accuracy, and \textbf{2.3\%} in C-index, establishing MARBLE as an efficient and generalizable framework for multi-scale WSI analysis.

### [11] [SRA-Seg: Synthetic to Real Alignment for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02944)
*OFM Riaz Rahman Aranya,Kevin Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRA-Seg bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real medical images for segmentation by aligning feature distributions using DINOv2 embeddings and soft edge blending, achieving strong performance with minimal labeled real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data for medical image segmentation fails to improve performance despite visual realism due to domain gaps between synthetic and real feature spaces that current semi-supervised methods cannot bridge.

Method: SRA-Seg uses similarity-alignment loss with frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward real counterparts, soft edge blending for smooth anatomical transitions, EMA teacher model for pseudo-labels, and soft-segmentation losses for uncertainty handling.

Result: Using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching real unlabeled data performance.

Conclusion: SRA-Seg successfully bridges the synthetic-real domain gap for medical image segmentation, enabling effective use of synthetic data as a viable alternative to extensive real annotations while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Synthetic data, an appealing alternative to extensive expert-annotated data for medical image segmentation, consistently fails to improve segmentation performance despite its visual realism. The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Sebastian Doerrich,Jonas Alle,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis improves domain generalization across diverse datasets and imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with robust generalization in medical imaging due to covariate shifts from different hardware, protocols, and patient populations. Euclidean manifolds fail to capture complex hierarchical structures in clinical data.

Method: Proposes hyperbolic representation learning to model complex data characteristics, with an unsupervised domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint for improved generalization.

Result: Achieves statistically significant gains across 11 in-distribution datasets and 3 ViT models. Outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by +2.1% AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks (Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, retinal imaging cross-dataset).

Conclusion: Hyperbolic manifolds effectively capture hierarchical structures in medical data, enabling better domain generalization across diverse imaging conditions and datasets.

Abstract: Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

*Yihong Huang,Fei Ma,Yihua Shao,Jingcai Guo,Zitong Yu,Laizhong Cui,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nüwa is a two-stage token pruning framework for Vision Language Models that maintains spatial integrity to improve performance on visual grounding tasks while accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for VLMs work well for VQA but degrade significantly on visual grounding tasks because they lose global spatial reference frames derived from token positional interactions.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) After vision encoder, use separation, alignment, and aggregation operations inspired by swarm intelligence to preserve global spatial anchors; 2) Within LLM, perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens.

Result: Achieves SOTA on VQA benchmarks (94% to 95%) and substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (7% to 47%), showing effectiveness in maintaining spatial integrity while pruning.

Conclusion: Nüwa successfully addresses the spatial reference loss problem in existing pruning methods, enabling efficient VLM acceleration while preserving performance on both VQA and visual grounding tasks through spatial-aware token pruning.

Abstract: Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

Abstract: Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses.

LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRACE is the first vision-language model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization for chest X-rays, achieving over 90% grounding accuracy and demonstrating that change detection emerges only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are learned together.


<details>

Motivation: Temporal comparison of chest X-rays is fundamental to clinical radiology for detecting disease progression, treatment response, and new findings. While vision-language models exist for single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection.

Method: TRACE (Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation) is introduced as the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given prior and current chest X-rays, it generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates.

Result: TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. The ablation study reveals an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection.

Conclusion: This finding suggests that grounding provides a spatial attention mechanism essential for temporal reasoning. TRACE represents a significant advancement in medical image analysis by combining temporal comparison with spatial localization for comprehensive clinical assessment.

Conclusion: The spatial-temporal attention mechanism enables robust and accurate lane detection in challenging conditions while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in automated vehicles and ADAS systems.

Abstract: Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

*Ruojing Li,Chao Xiao,Qian Yin,Wei An,Nuo Chen,Xinyi Ying,Miao Li,Yingqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHiF (Dynamic High-frequency Convolution) improves infrared small target detection by dynamically generating filters sensitive to high-frequency components, enabling better discrimination between targets and background clutter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based methods for single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various high-frequency components (HFCs) like bright corners and broken clouds, which is crucial for distinguishing targets from clutter.

Method: Proposes Dynamic High-frequency Convolution (DHiF) that translates discriminative modeling into dynamic local filter bank generation. DHiF is sensitive to HFCs through dynamic parameters symmetrically adjusted within zero-centered range based on Fourier transformation properties, working alongside standard convolution to adaptively process different HFC regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-scene datasets show DHiF exhibits superior detection performance compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, with promising improvement across different SIRST detection networks.

Conclusion: DHiF effectively addresses the challenge of distinguishing infrared small targets from other high-frequency components by enabling discriminative representation learning, serving as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Infrared small targets are typically tiny and locally salient, which belong to high-frequency components (HFCs) in images. Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement. Codes are available at https://github.com/TinaLRJ/DHiF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneLinker generates compositional 3D scenes from RGB sequences using semantic scene graphs for adaptive Mixed Reality content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable adaptive Mixed Reality content based on users' physical spaces, there's a need to generate 3D scenes that reflect real-world layouts by capturing semantic cues. Prior methods struggled with capturing contextual relationships between objects or focused mainly on shape synthesis, making it hard to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements.

Method: 1) A graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction; 2) A graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE) with joint shape and layout blocks for 3D scene generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints.

Conclusion: SceneLinker enables users to generate consistent 3D spaces from their physical environments via scene graphs, allowing creation of spatial Mixed Reality content that adapts to individual user spaces.

Abstract: We introduce SceneLinker, a novel framework that generates compositional 3D scenes via semantic scene graph from RGB sequences. To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints. Our work enables users to generate consistent 3D spaces from their physical environments via scene graphs, allowing them to create spatial MR content.

*Byeongju Woo,Zilin Wang,Byeonghyun Pak,Sangwoo Mo,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAFT is a hierarchical vision-language model that aligns global and local semantics between images and long captions without pixel-level supervision, achieving SOTA on long-text retrieval benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP struggle with long captions because they treat images and texts as undifferentiated wholes, lacking fine-grained hierarchical alignment between visual and textual domains. Visual hierarchies often fragment scenes without semantic focus, while linguistic hierarchies don't match visual organization.

Method: CAFT couples a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, using a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences. This builds coarse semantics from fine-grained evidence rather than untethered aggregation.

Result: Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. The model enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.

Conclusion: Hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables effective fine-grained vision-language understanding for long captions without requiring pixel-level supervision, addressing limitations of existing models that treat images and texts as undifferentiated wholes.

Abstract: Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.

TL;DR: SharpTimeGS: A lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework for novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of static and dynamic regions with real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based methods struggle to balance representation and optimization between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: Introduces learnable lifespan parameter for temporal visibility with flat-top profile, lifespan-modulated motion control, and lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy for balanced optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks with real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.

Conclusion: SharpTimeGS effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity through lifespan-aware modeling.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes is fundamental to achieving photorealistic 4D reconstruction and immersive visual experiences. Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods for Temporal Video Grounding suffer from sparse reward signals and high computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Video-OPD uses on-policy distillation with a frontier teacher providing dense token-level supervision via reverse KL divergence. It includes Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF) - a curriculum that prioritizes teacher-reliable and informative trajectories for efficient training.

Result: Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.

Conclusion: On-policy distillation is a superior alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for Temporal Video Grounding, offering better performance, faster convergence, and reduced computational requirements through dense supervision and efficient curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a principled post-training paradigm for Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) due to its on-policy optimization, yet existing GRPO-based methods remain fundamentally constrained by sparse reward signals and substantial computational overhead. We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOILA is a framework for adaptive fidelity selection in VQA that optimizes visual information retrieval before model execution, achieving 50-60% cost reduction while maintaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, creating inefficiency in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, 2) isotonic calibrator refines probabilities for reliable decision-making, then selects minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility.

Result: Evaluated across 3 deployment scenarios, 5 datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet), and 6 VLMs (7B-235B parameters). Consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures.

Conclusion: Pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints, demonstrating that adaptive fidelity selection can dramatically reduce costs while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels. We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address information loss in image inpainting during convolutional downsampling by using statistical normalization and denormalization to guide reconstruction of structure and texture features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image inpainting methods using encoder-decoder pipelines with convolutional downsampling suffer from information loss in both structure and texture feature maps, leading to suboptimal upsampling outputs. The authors aim to systematically address whether and how structure and texture features can mutually help alleviate this information loss.

Method: The method adopts statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for reconstruction guidance during convolutional downsampling. Given structure and texture feature maps, it uses this strategy to preserve information and guide the reconstruction process throughout the downsampling operations.

Result: Extensive experiments show advantages over state-of-the-art methods on images from low-to-high resolutions (256×256 and 512×512). The approach is validated by substituting all encoders with the proposed method, demonstrating consistent improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical normalization and denormalization strategy effectively addresses information loss during convolutional downsampling in image inpainting, leading to better reconstruction of both structure and texture features and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Image inpainting has earned substantial progress, owing to the encoder-and-decoder pipeline, which is benefited from the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutional downsampling to inpaint the masked regions semantically from the known regions within the encoder, coupled with an upsampling process from the decoder for final inpainting output. Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

TL;DR: MUSE is a multi-agent framework for generating coherent long-form audio-visual stories from short prompts by using iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loops to maintain narrative intent and identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating long-form audio-visual stories suffer from semantic drift and identity inconsistency due to feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, creating an intent-execution gap where high-level narrative intent must be preserved across shot-level multimodal generation over long horizons.

Method: MUSE formulates storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem using a multi-agent framework with iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loops. It translates narrative intent into explicit machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, applying targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation.

Result: Experiments show MUSE substantially improves long-horizon narrative coherence, cross-modal identity consistency, and cinematic quality compared with representative baselines. The paper also introduces MUSEBench, a reference-free evaluation protocol validated by human judgments.

Conclusion: The MUSE framework effectively addresses the intent-execution gap in long-form audio-visual story generation through iterative constraint enforcement and multimodal feedback, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining narrative coherence and identity consistency over extended sequences.

Abstract: Generating long-form audio-visual stories from a short user prompt remains challenging due to an intent-execution gap, where high-level narrative intent must be preserved across coherent, shot-level multimodal generation over long horizons. Existing approaches typically rely on feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, which often leads to semantic drift and identity inconsistency as sequences grow longer. We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation. To evaluate open-ended storytelling without ground-truth references, we introduce MUSEBench, a reference-free evaluation protocol validated by human judgments. Experiments demonstrate that MUSE substantially improves long-horizon narrative coherence, cross-modal identity consistency, and cinematic quality compared with representative baselines.

Motivation: While VLMs excel at everyday visual tasks, they struggle with the novel visual reasoning required by Bongard problems, which test human-like ability to reason in radically new situations.

Method: Neurosymbolic approach: use LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations of hypothesized solution rules, then perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization.

Result: The method is evaluated on two tasks: classifying Bongard problem images given ground truth rules, and solving problems from scratch without rule knowledge.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach combining LLMs with Bayesian optimization shows promise for solving challenging visual reasoning problems like Bongard problems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made great strides in everyday visual tasks, such as captioning a natural image, or answering commonsense questions about such images. But humans possess the puzzling ability to deploy their visual reasoning abilities in radically new situations, a skill rigorously tested by the classic set of visual reasoning challenges known as the Bongard problems. We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HP-GAN improves GAN training by using pretrained networks with self-supervised learning (FakeTwins) and enforcing consistency between CNN and ViT discriminators, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GAN methods use pretrained networks for perceptual losses, but don't fully exploit their potential. The paper aims to better leverage pretrained networks through self-supervised learning and discriminator consistency to improve image diversity and quality.

Method: HP-GAN introduces two key strategies: 1) FakeTwins - uses pretrained networks as encoders to compute self-supervised loss applied through generated images to train the generator, 2) Discriminator consistency - enforces alignment between discriminators evaluating CNN and ViT feature maps to promote coherent learning and training robustness.

Result: Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets (large, small, limited data, various domains) shows HP-GAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FID scores, with significant improvements in both image diversity and quality.

Conclusion: HP-GAN effectively exploits neural network priors through self-supervised learning and discriminator consistency, providing a robust approach that advances GAN performance across diverse data scenarios and image domains.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in enhancing the quality of image synthesis. Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

*Zhichao Sun,Yidong Ma,Gang Liu,Yibo Chen,Xu Tang,Yao Hu,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IVC-Prune: A training-free pruning method for Large Vision-Language Models that preserves both semantic foreground tokens and implicit visual coordinate tokens crucial for spatial reasoning, achieving ~50% token reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs have high inference costs when processing high-resolution images. Existing visual token pruning methods focus on semantic relevance but discard tokens essential for spatial reasoning, leading to performance degradation in spatial tasks.

Method: IVC-Prune identifies two types of crucial tokens: 1) Implicit Visual Coordinate (IVC) tokens found by analyzing RoPE's mathematical properties (positions where rotation matrices approximate identity or 90° rotation), and 2) foreground tokens identified through semantic seed discovery and contextual refinement via value-vector similarity.

Result: IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50% while maintaining ≥99% of original performance across four LVLMs and twenty benchmarks, with some benchmarks showing performance improvements.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that preserving both semantic and spatial reasoning tokens is crucial for effective LVLM pruning, and provides a training-free, prompt-aware solution that significantly reduces inference costs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance across multiple tasks. A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\% while maintaining $\geq$ 99\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JRDB-Pose3D is a new dataset for 3D human pose estimation in crowded real-world indoor/outdoor scenes captured from a mobile robot, featuring SMPL-based annotations with consistent body shapes and track IDs for multiple people (5-35 per frame).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human pose datasets focus on single-person scenes or controlled lab environments, limiting their relevance to real-world applications like autonomous driving and human-robot interaction that require understanding crowded scenes with multiple people.

Method: The authors introduce JRDB-Pose3D dataset captured from a mobile robotic platform, providing SMPL-based 3D pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time in complex indoor/outdoor environments.

Result: The dataset contains 5-10 human poses per frame on average, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously, presenting challenges like frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts that reflect real-world conditions.

Conclusion: JRDB-Pose3D bridges the gap between controlled lab datasets and real-world applications by providing rich 3D pose annotations for crowded scenes, inheriting all JRDB dataset annotations for holistic human-centric understanding tasks.

Abstract: Real-world scenes are inherently crowded. Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks.

*Sunoh Kim,Kimin Yun,Daeho Um*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GBO is a novel inference framework for weakly supervised temporal video grounding that optimizes segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem, improving localization performance without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based temporal proposal methods for weakly supervised video grounding rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, leading to suboptimal localization performance.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a training-free inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving an optimization problem balancing proposal coverage and segment compactness, with a closed-form solution and analysis of optimality conditions.

Result: GBO significantly improves localization performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks, and demonstrates efficiency and generalizability across various proposal schemes.

Conclusion: GBO provides a principled, theoretically-grounded inference framework that overcomes limitations of heuristic boundary mapping in weakly supervised temporal video grounding, offering practical advantages of being training-free and compatible with existing proposal architectures.

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal video grounding aims to localize query-relevant segments in untrimmed videos using only video-sentence pairs, without requiring ground-truth segment annotations that specify exact temporal boundaries. Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

Conclusion: SKELEX provides a scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, establishing a foundation for clinical translation and data-efficient research in musculoskeletal radiology.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal diseases from radiographs. However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application. Overall, SKELEX provides a scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, establishing a foundation for both clinical translation and data-efficient research in musculoskeletal radiology.

*Francis Snelgar,Stephen Gould,Ming Xu,Liang Zheng,Akshay Asthana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing Stable Diffusion features in semantic correspondence methods with an optimal transport algorithm featuring Gromov-Wasserstein spatial smoothness, achieving competitive performance with 5-10x efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art semantic correspondence methods combine DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion features, but this ensemble approach is computationally expensive due to evaluating feature maps from large foundation models.

Method: Replace Stable Diffusion features with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov-Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior, instead of using standard nearest neighbors matching with DINOv2 features.

Result: Significantly boosts DINOv2 baseline performance, achieves competitive and sometimes superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5-10x more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: A superior matching algorithm with spatial consistency properties can effectively replace expensive foundation model features for semantic correspondence, offering a more efficient alternative to current ensemble approaches.

Abstract: Establishing correspondences between image pairs is a long studied problem in computer vision. With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

TL;DR: EvoAug is an automated augmentation learning pipeline that uses generative models and evolutionary algorithms to learn optimal task-specific augmentations through stochastic augmentation trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation methods like cropping/rotation have limitations, while new generative models (diffusion, NeRFs) offer greater diversity but risk performance degradation if poorly matched to tasks. Need automated way to find optimal generative augmentations.

Method: EvoAug combines generative models with evolutionary algorithm to learn stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling structured and adaptive transformations.

Result: Strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge even in low-data settings.

Conclusion: Learned generative augmentations have significant potential for robust model training, unlocking new possibilities beyond traditional augmentation methods.

Abstract: Data augmentation has long been a cornerstone for reducing overfitting in vision models, with methods like AutoAugment automating the design of task-specific augmentations. Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training.

### [35] [Feature, Alignment, and Supervision in Category Learning: A Comparative Approach with Children and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03124)
*Fanxiao Wani Qiu,Oscar Leong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Children and CNNs learn differently from sparse labeled data in category learning tasks, with children showing rapid generalization from minimal labels but strong feature biases, while CNNs benefit more from added supervision depending on feature structure and perceptual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and machines learn from sparse data by comparing children and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under identical conditions in a few-shot semi-supervised category learning task.

Method: Species-fair design comparing children and CNNs in few-shot semi-supervised category learning. Both exposed to novel object categories under identical conditions with mixtures of labeled and unlabeled exemplars. Variables manipulated: supervision levels (1/3/6 labels), target features (size, shape, pattern), and perceptual alignment (high/low).

Result: Children generalize rapidly from minimal labels but show strong feature-specific biases and sensitivity to alignment. CNNs show different interaction patterns: added supervision improves performance, but both alignment and feature structure moderate the impact of additional supervision on learning.

Conclusion: Human-model comparisons must be drawn under appropriate conditions, emphasizing interactions among supervision, feature structure, and perceptual alignment rather than focusing solely on overall accuracy. The learning mechanisms differ fundamentally between children and CNNs in sparse data scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding how humans and machines learn from sparse data is central to cognitive science and machine learning. Using a species-fair design, we compare children and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a few-shot semi-supervised category learning task. Both learners are exposed to novel object categories under identical conditions. Learners receive mixtures of labeled and unlabeled exemplars while we vary supervision (1/3/6 labels), target feature (size, shape, pattern), and perceptual alignment (high/low). We find that children generalize rapidly from minimal labels but show strong feature-specific biases and sensitivity to alignment. CNNs show a different interaction profile: added supervision improves performance, but both alignment and feature structure moderate the impact additional supervision has on learning. These results show that human-model comparisons must be drawn under the right conditions, emphasizing interactions among supervision, feature structure, and alignment rather than overall accuracy.

### [36] [Flexible Geometric Guidance for Probabilistic Human Pose Estimation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03126)
*Francis Snelgar,Ming Xu,Stephen Gould,Liang Zheng,Akshay Asthana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based framework for 3D human pose estimation that samples multiple plausible poses from 2D images without requiring paired 2D-3D training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods assume deterministic mapping from 2D to 3D poses, ignoring the inherent ambiguity of the problem. Existing learning-based methods require large paired datasets and suffer from generalization issues.

Method: Uses diffusion models with guidance framework for conditional generation. Guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model (trained only on 3D data) using gradients from 2D keypoint detector heatmaps.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Human 3.6M under best-of-m multiple hypothesis evaluation among methods not requiring paired 2D-3D data. Competitive generalization on MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: The diffusion framework effectively addresses pose ambiguity, eliminates need for paired training data, and demonstrates flexibility for pose generation/completion tasks without requiring task-specific conditional models.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from 2D images is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

TL;DR: FinMTM is a comprehensive multi-turn multimodal benchmark for evaluating VLMs on financial tasks, featuring 11K+ bilingual QA pairs across diverse chart types and task formats with specialized evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial benchmarks are limited - they're mostly single-turn, use narrow question formats, and don't adequately evaluate VLMs in realistic financial application scenarios where complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions are needed.

Method: Created FinMTM benchmark with: 1) 11,133 bilingual Chinese/English QA pairs grounded in financial visuals (candlestick charts, statistical plots, report figures); 2) Diverse task formats including single/multiple-choice, multi-turn dialogues, and agent-based tasks; 3) Specialized evaluation protocols for each task type.

Result: Evaluation of 22 VLMs revealed significant limitations in: fine-grained visual perception of financial charts, long-context reasoning across multi-turn dialogues, and handling complex agent workflows in financial scenarios.

Conclusion: FinMTM addresses critical gaps in financial VLM evaluation by providing a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark that better reflects real-world application requirements, revealing current model limitations and establishing a foundation for future improvements in financial AI systems.

Abstract: The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiftVLM is a training-free visual token pruning method that uses a bypass paradigm to preserve potentially important tokens across layers, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods make early pruning decisions that cause irreversible loss of fine-grained visual details needed for complex reasoning tasks, leading to significant performance degradation.

Method: Introduces a bypass paradigm that preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. SwiftVLM performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers.

Result: SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies across multiple VLMs and benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

Conclusion: The bypass paradigm addresses the limitation of premature pruning by allowing tokens to be re-evaluated across layers, making visual token pruning more effective for tasks requiring fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSOD-VFM is a few-shot object detection framework that uses vision foundation models with a graph-based confidence reweighting method to address overfragmentation in bounding box proposals, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models have strong generalization capabilities but often produce overfragmented bounding boxes in few-shot object detection, covering only partial object regions and generating many small false-positive proposals instead of complete object detections.

Method: The framework integrates three components: universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding boxes, SAM2 for mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for adaptation. A novel graph-based confidence reweighting method models bounding boxes as nodes in a directed graph and uses graph diffusion to propagate confidence scores, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to fragmented parts.

Result: FSOD-VFM substantially outperforms existing approaches on Pascal-5^i, COCO-20^i, and CD-FSOD datasets without requiring additional training. On the challenging CD-FSOD dataset in 10-shot setting, it achieves 31.6 AP compared to previous training-free methods' 21.4 AP.

Conclusion: The graph-based confidence reweighting method effectively addresses overfragmentation in foundation model proposals, improving detection granularity and reducing false positives, making FSOD-VFM a powerful training-free solution for few-shot object detection across multiple domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

*Tianhe Wu,Ruibin Li,Lei Zhang,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP-DMD is a simple yet effective distillation framework that prevents mode collapse in diffusion models by separating roles: first step preserves diversity via target-prediction, subsequent steps refine quality via DMD loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution matching distillation (DMD) enables efficient few-step generation but suffers from mode collapse due to its reverse-KL formulation, and existing remedies require complex perceptual/adversarial regularization with computational overhead and instability.

Method: Role-separated distillation framework: first step uses target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) to preserve diversity, subsequent steps use standard DMD loss for quality refinement, with DMD gradients blocked at first step. No perceptual backbone, discriminator, auxiliary networks, or additional ground-truth images needed.

Result: DP-DMD preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments, despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: DP-DMD offers an effective solution to mode collapse in DMD without complex regularization, achieving both diversity preservation and high-quality generation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Distribution matching distillation (DMD) aligns a multi-step generator with its few-step counterpart to enable high-quality generation under low inference cost. However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first fully Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA)-based deep model called ALL U-KAN, which overcomes training difficulties and memory issues of deeply stacked KANs through Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) and Grad-Free Spline techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deeply stacked KANs face practical limitations due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements, preventing comprehensive exploration of KAN architectures. Existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the potential of KA-based models.

Method: 1) SaKAN reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem for better optimization with simplified parameterization and denser training samples. 2) Grad-Free Spline eliminates spline gradients that consume huge GPU memory while contributing negligibly to training. 3) ALL U-KAN implements fully KA-based deep model where KA and KAonv layers completely replace traditional FC and Conv layers.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks show superiority over partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to deeply stacked KANs, ALL U-KAN achieves 10× parameter reduction and 20× memory consumption reduction.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning, achieving superior learning capacity while overcoming previous limitations, unlocking new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

Abstract: Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

TL;DR: Human-in-the-loop adaptation for group activity feature learning without group activity annotations, improving video retrieval performance through interactive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group activity recognition methods require supervised learning with pre-defined activity classes, which limits flexibility and requires extensive annotations. The paper aims to enable group activity video retrieval without group activity annotations by incorporating human feedback.

Method: 1. Self-supervised pre-training of Group Activity Feature (GAF) space based on activity similarity. 2. Interactive fine-tuning where users provide positive/negative labels for selected videos. 3. Data-efficient video selection process to choose informative videos for labeling. 4. Contrastive learning to update GAF space, moving positive videos closer and negative videos farther from queries.

Result: Significant improvement in retrieval performance on two team sports datasets. Ablation studies confirm contributions of various human-in-the-loop adaptation components to performance gains.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop adaptation enables effective group activity video retrieval without group activity annotations, with interactive fine-tuning and data-efficient video selection being key components for performance improvement.

Abstract: This paper proposes human-in-the-loop adaptation for Group Activity Feature Learning (GAFL) without group activity annotations. This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

*Zheng Chen,Zhi Yang,Xiaoyang Liu,Weihang Zhang,Mengfan Wang,Yifan Fu,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BinaryDemoire: A binarized demoiréing framework that uses frequency-aware gating and structured residual adapters to effectively remove moiré patterns with extreme 1-bit compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image demoiréing requires removing frequency-dependent moiré artifacts, but existing deep networks are computationally expensive for deployment. Binarization offers extreme compression (1-bit weights/activations) but performs poorly when naively applied to demoiréing due to the complex frequency structure of moiré patterns.

Method: Proposes BinaryDemoire with two key components: 1) Moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts frequency descriptors and activation statistics to predict channel-wise gating coefficients for aggregating binary convolution responses; 2) Shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment with interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across channel partitions.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods for demoiréing tasks.

Conclusion: BinaryDemoire effectively addresses the challenge of applying extreme binarization to demoiréing by explicitly accommodating the frequency structure of moiré degradations through frequency-aware gating and structured residual adaptation.

Abstract: Image demoiréing aims to remove structured moiré artifacts in recaptured imagery, where degradations are highly frequency-dependent and vary across scales and directions. While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSGQuant is a layer-sensitivity guided quantization method for one-step diffusion-based video super-resolution that maintains near-original performance while significantly reducing model size and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step diffusion models show promise for real-world video super-resolution but suffer from large model size and high computational cost due to Diffusion Transformers. Standard low-bit quantization struggles with the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors.

Method: Proposes LSGQuant with three key components: 1) Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations, 2) Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) based on layer sensitivity analysis, and 3) Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine quantized and high-precision branches.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves nearly the same performance as the original full-precision model and significantly outperforms existing quantization techniques.

Conclusion: LSGQuant effectively addresses quantization challenges in diffusion-based VSR, enabling practical deployment with minimal performance degradation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: One-Step Diffusion Models have demonstrated promising capability and fast inference in video super-resolution (VSR) for real-world. Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has nearly performance to origin model with full-precision and significantly exceeds existing quantization techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempLoc: A temporal-aware LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances robustness by modeling sequential consistency through uncertainty-guided coordinate fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based LiDAR relocalization methods are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios because they either rely on single-frame inference or neglect spatio-temporal consistency across scans. There's a need for more robust approaches that can handle these challenging situations.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Global Coordinate Estimation module predicts point-wise global coordinates with uncertainties for each LiDAR scan; 2) Prior Coordinate Generation module estimates inter-frame point correspondences using attention mechanism; 3) Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module integrates both predictions end-to-end for temporally consistent 6-DoF pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization.

Conclusion: TempLoc effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating temporal consistency modeling through uncertainty-guided fusion, resulting in more robust and accurate LiDAR relocalization in dynamic and ambiguous scenarios.

Abstract: LiDAR relocalization aims to estimate the global 6-DoF pose of a sensor in the environment. However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose. Experimental results on the NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks show that our TempLoc outperforms stateof-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization. Our code will be released soon.

TL;DR: VIRAL is a framework that enables visual in-context learning by using a pre-trained image editing model to perform visual reasoning through analogies, achieving strong performance across diverse visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicating in-context learning (ICL) in computer vision is challenging due to task heterogeneity - different visual tasks require different approaches, making it difficult to create a unified framework that can handle diverse visual tasks through in-context learning like language models do.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VIRAL outperforms existing methods, validating that a unified visual ICL paradigm can handle the majority of visual tasks, including open-domain editing.

Conclusion: The VIRAL framework successfully enables visual in-context learning through analogical reasoning, showing that a unified approach can handle diverse visual tasks including perception, restoration, and editing, with code made publicly available.

TL;DR: ConsisDrive is an identity-preserving driving world model that prevents object identity drift in generated driving videos using instance-level temporal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for autonomous driving suffer from identity drift - where objects change appearance or category across frames due to lack of instance-level temporal constraints, limiting their usefulness for training robust autonomous driving systems.

Method: Two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention that uses identity and trajectory masks to restrict visual token interactions to corresponding instance features across space and time; (2) Instance-Masked Loss that adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking while maintaining scene fidelity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and shows significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: ConsisDrive effectively addresses identity drift in driving world models through instance-level temporal constraints, enabling high-quality, identity-consistent driving video generation that benefits autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on large-scale, high-quality multi-view driving videos. Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FARTrack is a fast autoregressive tracking framework that achieves high speed (up to 343 FPS on GPU) while maintaining competitive performance (70.6% AO on GOT-10k) through task-specific self-distillation and inter-frame autoregressive sparsification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance trackers are often too slow for resource-constrained devices, creating a need for tracking solutions that balance both speed and accuracy for practical deployment.

Method: FARTrack uses an autoregressive framework with two key techniques: 1) Task-Specific Self-Distillation for layer-by-layer compression of task-specific tokens to enhance speed without manual teacher-student assignments, and 2) Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification to sequentially condense multiple templates while learning optimal sparsification strategies without runtime overhead.

Result: Achieves 70.6% AO on GOT-10k in real-time, with fastest model reaching 343 FPS on GPU and 121 FPS on CPU, demonstrating outstanding speed while maintaining competitive tracking performance.

Conclusion: FARTrack successfully addresses the speed-performance tradeoff in visual tracking through autoregressive design and novel optimization techniques, making high-performance tracking practical for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Inference speed and tracking performance are two critical evaluation metrics in the field of visual tracking. However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU.

*Jingbang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PokeFusion Attention: A lightweight decoder-level cross-attention mechanism for reference-free style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling style-text decoupling while keeping the pretrained backbone frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for stylized character generation have limitations: text-only prompting is under-specified causing style drift and geometric inconsistency, while reference-based adapters increase complexity and reduce deployment flexibility by requiring external images at inference.

Method: Proposes PokeFusion Attention - a decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual semantics with learned style embeddings directly in the diffusion decoder. Decouples text and style conditioning at attention level, trains only decoder cross-attention layers with a compact style projection module, keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.

Result: Experiments on Pokemon-style character generation benchmark show consistent improvements in style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared to adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.

Conclusion: PokeFusion Attention provides a parameter-efficient, plug-and-play control component for reference-free stylized generation that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones, addressing limitations of both text-only and reference-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper studies reference-free style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, where high-quality synthesis requires both stable character structure and consistent, fine-grained style expression across diverse prompts. Existing approaches primarily rely on text-only prompting, which is often under-specified for visual style and tends to produce noticeable style drift and geometric inconsistency, or introduce reference-based adapters that depend on external images at inference time, increasing architectural complexity and limiting deployment flexibility.We propose PokeFusion Attention, a lightweight decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual semantics with learned style embeddings directly inside the diffusion decoder. By decoupling text and style conditioning at the attention level, our method enables effective reference-free stylized generation while keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.PokeFusion Attention trains only decoder cross-attention layers together with a compact style projection module, resulting in a parameter-efficient and plug-and-play control component that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones.Experiments on a stylized character generation benchmark (Pokemon-style) demonstrate that our method consistently improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared with representative adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.

*Haoyu Liu,Sucheng Ren,Tingyu Zhu,Peng Wang,Cihang Xie,Alan Yuille,Zeyu Zheng,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spiral RoPE extends standard 2D RoPE to enable multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers, overcoming the axis-aligned limitation and improving performance across vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard axial 2D RoPE in vision transformers restricts positional encoding to horizontal and vertical directions, which limits modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in images. This directional constraint hinders the model's ability to capture complex spatial patterns.

Method: Spiral RoPE partitions embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of patch positions onto its corresponding direction, enabling encoding of spatial relationships beyond just horizontal and vertical axes.

Result: Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance across vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation. Attention maps show more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respect for local object boundaries.

Conclusion: Multi-directional positional encoding is important for vision transformers, and Spiral RoPE effectively addresses the limitations of standard axial 2D RoPE by enabling encoding of oblique spatial relationships, leading to better performance and more meaningful attention patterns.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.

Motivation: Current event-based MLLMs use dense image-like processing that ignores the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams, leading to high computational costs. There's a need for more efficient processing that leverages the inherent sparsity of event data.

Method: 1) Created EventMind dataset with 500k+ instruction sets for curriculum training; 2) Adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling; 3) Sparse density-guided attention module for spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing sparse areas.

Result: Achieves 12.4× throughput improvement over baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. Supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming EventGPT's 5-bin limit.

Conclusion: EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision by effectively leveraging spatiotemporal sparsity to reduce computational costs while maintaining robust perception capabilities.

Abstract: Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.

Method: Extends existing VPR datasets with 650K+ natural language descriptions. Investigates two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss.

Result: Language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with most significant impact on smaller backbones. Adding language allows compact models to rival performance of much larger vision-only architectures. Cross-modal retrieval with LoRA and Multi-Similarity loss substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods.

Conclusion: LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment, bridging vision and language for robust place recognition.

### [55] [Global Geometry Is Not Enough for Vision Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03282)
*Jiwan Chung,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Standard geometric metrics fail to predict compositional binding in vision encoders, while functional sensitivity (Jacobian) reliably tracks this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning assumes globally well-distributed embeddings support robust representations, treating global geometry as a proxy for competence. However, this approach may miss how elements are composed together.

Method: Tested 21 vision encoders to see if geometric metrics predict compositional binding. Compared standard geometry-based statistics with functional sensitivity measured by input-output Jacobian. Provided analytic account linking disparity to objective design.

Result: Geometry-based statistics show near-zero correlation with compositional binding, while functional sensitivity reliably tracks this capability. The disparity arises because existing losses constrain embedding geometry but leave local input-output mapping unconstrained.

Conclusion: Global embedding geometry captures only partial view of representational competence. Functional sensitivity is a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure in representations.

Abstract: A common assumption in representation learning is that globally well-distributed embeddings support robust and generalizable representations. This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure.

### [56] [A3-TTA: Adaptive Anchor Alignment Test-Time Adaptation for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03292)
*Jianghao Wu,Xiangde Luo,Yubo Zhou,Lianming Wu,Guotai Wang,Shaoting Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A3-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for image segmentation that uses anchor-guided supervision to generate reliable pseudo-labels, addressing error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in domain shift scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-label-based TTA methods rely on heuristic perturbation ensembles that lack distributional grounding, causing unstable training signals, error accumulation, and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation to target domains.

Method: Proposes A3-TTA with anchor-guided supervision: identifies well-predicted target images using class compact density metric as anchors; uses these as stable references for pseudo-label generation; regularizes with semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization; employs self-adaptive exponential moving average to mitigate label noise and stabilize updates.

Result: Significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points over source model; outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods across medical (heart structure, prostate) and natural images; excels in continual TTA with strong anti-forgetting ability across sequential domains.

Conclusion: A3-TTA effectively addresses limitations of existing TTA methods by providing distributionally-grounded pseudo-labels through anchor guidance, enabling stable adaptation and strong performance across diverse segmentation tasks and domain shift scenarios.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA.

### [57] [QVLA: Not All Channels Are Equal in Vision-Language-Action Model's Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03782)
*Yuhao Xu,Yantai Yang,Zhenyang Fan,Yufan Liu,Yuming Li,Bing Li,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QVLA is an action-centric quantization framework for Vision-Language-Action models that uses channel-wise bit allocation based on action-space sensitivity, achieving significant compression (29.2% VRAM) with minimal performance loss (98.9% original performance).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have immense computational demands that hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Existing quantization methods from LLMs are flawed for robotics because they prioritize data fidelity over action accuracy, where minor action deviations can cause catastrophic task failures.

Method: QVLA introduces a channel-wise bit allocation strategy that measures action-space sensitivity when quantizing each channel to various bit-widths. This creates per-channel importance metrics that guide global optimization, unifying quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single framework.

Result: On LIBERO benchmark, QVLA-compressed OpenVLA-OFT requires only 29.2% of original VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of original performance with 1.49x speedup, outperforming LLM-derived SmoothQuant by 22.6% performance improvement.

Conclusion: QVLA establishes a principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, enabling deployment of powerful large-scale models on real-world hardware by addressing the unique requirements of embodied control systems.

Abstract: The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized retinal disease diagnosis with its high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging nature, yet its full diagnostic automation in clinical practices remains constrained by multi-stage workflows and conventional single-slice single-task AI models. We present Full-process OCT-based Clinical Utility System (FOCUS), a foundation model-driven framework enabling end-to-end automation of 3D OCT retinal disease diagnosis. FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency.

### [60] [Invisible Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks for Generative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03316)
*Ting Xiang,Jinhui Zhao,Changjian Chen,Zhuo Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvLBA: An invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation using latent perturbations that achieves high attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attacks (like COMBAT) perform poorly on generated images from generative data augmentation, showing low attack success rates. This motivates exploring latent feature-level attacks instead of pixel-level triggers.

Method: InvLBA (Invisible clean-label Backdoor Attack) operates at the latent feature level rather than pixel level. It uses latent perturbations for generative data augmentation, making the attack invisible while maintaining clean labels. The method theoretically guarantees generalization of both clean accuracy and attack success rates.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show InvLBA improves attack success rate by 46.43% on average compared to existing methods, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy. The method also demonstrates high robustness against state-of-the-art defense methods.

Conclusion: Latent feature-level attacks are more effective than pixel-level attacks for generative data augmentation scenarios. InvLBA provides an invisible, clean-label backdoor attack that maintains high attack success rates while preserving model utility and evading detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generative models, generative data augmentation has become an effective way to enrich training images, especially when only small-scale datasets are available. At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based approaches for medical image segmentation rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision, limiting their ability to fully exploit interactive tools and leading to redundant actions.

Method: 1) Hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation to internalize human-like decision heuristics; 2) Two-stage training pipeline with multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification and clinical-fidelity process reward design for interaction parsimony.

Result: Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Conclusion: MedSAM-Agent bridges the gap in current interactive segmentation approaches by enabling multi-step autonomous decision-making with process-level supervision, achieving superior performance while promoting interaction efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Motivation: Current adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds achieve spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, while existing defenses are cumbersome, requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training, or auxiliary data access.

Method: Proposes PWAVEP - a spectral domain purification framework that computes spectral graph wavelet domain saliency and local sparsity scores for each point, then uses hierarchical strategy: eliminates highly salient adversarial outliers and applies spectral filtering to moderately salient points using graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Conclusion: PWAVEP provides an effective plug-and-play, non-invasive defense mechanism against adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds by leveraging spectral domain analysis and hierarchical purification.

Abstract: Recent progress in adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, particularly in achieving spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, presents significant challenges for defenders. Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompTok is a training framework for learning compositional visual tokenizers using token-conditioned diffusion with InfoGAN-style objectives and token swapping for enhanced compositionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create visual tokenizers that enable better compositional control in image generation, allowing high-level semantic editing through token manipulation while maintaining natural image distributions.

Method: Uses token-conditioned diffusion decoder with InfoGAN-style objective (recognition model predicts tokens from decoded images). Trains on original images plus token subsets swapped between images. Applies adversarial flow regularizer for manifold constraint on unpaired swap generations.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on image class-conditioned generation. Enables semantic editing via token swapping. Proposes and improves on two metrics measuring token space compositionality and learnability for generators.

Conclusion: CompTok successfully creates compositional visual tokenizers that support advanced image editing capabilities while maintaining generation quality, with measurable improvements in token space properties.

Abstract: We introduce CompTok, a training framework for learning visual tokenizers whose tokens are enhanced for compositionality. CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.

TL;DR: Tiled Prompts addresses prompt underspecification in diffusion-based super-resolution by generating tile-specific prompts for each latent tile instead of using a single global caption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern super-resolution pipelines use latent tiling for high resolutions, but a single global caption causes prompt underspecification - missing localized details (prompt sparsity) and providing locally irrelevant guidance (prompt misguidance) that gets amplified by classifier-free guidance.

Method: A unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates tile-specific prompts for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance with minimal overhead.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts compared to global-prompt baselines.

Conclusion: Tiled Prompts effectively resolves prompt underspecification in diffusion-based super-resolution by providing localized text guidance, improving results while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have advanced image and video super-resolution by using prompts as semantic priors, but modern super-resolution pipelines typically rely on latent tiling to scale to high resolutions, where a single global caption causes prompt underspecification. A coarse global prompt often misses localized details (prompt sparsity) and provides locally irrelevant guidance (prompt misguidance) that can be amplified by classifier-free guidance. We propose Tiled Prompts, a unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates a tile-specific prompt for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance that resolves prompt underspecification with minimal overhead. Experiments on high resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts relative to global-prompt baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based 3D SSC methods face optimization challenges due to voxel sparsity (many empty voxels in autonomous driving scenarios), which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance.

Method: Proposes Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA) with three modules: 1) Multi-resolution View Transformer for scene-level alignment of 2D-to-3D features, 2) Cubic Semantic Anisotropy for instance-level semantic significance, and 3) Critical Distribution Alignment for instance-level supervision using critical voxels.

Result: The approach mitigates voxel sparsity issues in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, improving optimization efficiency and model performance through auxiliary supervision from multi-resolution feature alignment.

Conclusion: MRA effectively addresses voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D SSC by exploiting multi-resolution alignment at both scene and instance levels, providing better optimization and performance for autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) offers a cost-effective solution for assessing the geometric occupancy and semantic labels of each voxel in the surrounding 3D scene with image inputs, providing a voxel-level scene perception foundation for the perception-prediction-planning autonomous driving systems. Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Focal cortical dysplasia lesions in epilepsy FLAIR MRI are subtle and scarce, making joint image-mask generative modeling prone to instability and memorization problems.

Method: Proposes SLIM-Diff with: (i) single shared-bottleneck U-Net enforcing tight coupling between anatomy and lesion geometry from 2-channel image+mask representation, (ii) loss-geometry tuning via tunable Lp objective, comparing DDPM-style objective (ε-prediction with L2 loss) with x0-prediction under matched setup.

Result: x0-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis; fractional sub-quadratic penalties (L1.5) improve image fidelity while L2 better preserves lesion mask morphology.

Conclusion: SLIM-Diff provides an effective compact joint diffusion model for generating FLAIR MRI with FCD lesions, with optimal performance achieved through x0-prediction and carefully tuned Lp loss geometry balancing image quality and lesion morphology preservation.

Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions in epilepsy FLAIR MRI are subtle and scarce, making joint image--mask generative modeling prone to instability and memorization. We propose SLIM-Diff, a compact joint diffusion model whose main contributions are (i) a single shared-bottleneck U-Net that enforces tight coupling between anatomy and lesion geometry from a 2-channel image+mask representation, and (ii) loss-geometry tuning via a tunable $L_p$ objective. As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($ε$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology.

*Jiale Meng,Runyi Hu,Jie Zhang,Zheming Lu,Ivor Tsang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiM is a multi-dimensional watermarking framework that unifies existing methods by modeling watermark information as payloads of different dimensionalities (1D binary, 2D spatial, 3D spatiotemporal) and showing that dimensional configuration determines watermarking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep watermarking methods share similar encoder-decoder architectures but have substantially different functional behaviors. There's a need for a unified framework that explains these differences and enables systematic exploration of watermarking capabilities.

Method: DiM formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, modeling watermark information as payloads of different dimensionalities. It analyzes how same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and enable fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. The framework is instantiated in the video domain to explore spatiotemporal representations.

Result: Experiments show that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions (without architectural changes) leads to different watermarking capabilities: spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.

Conclusion: DiM provides a unified framework for understanding and designing watermarking methods by revealing that dimensional configuration is a key determinant of watermarking behavior, enabling systematic exploration of capabilities through dimension mappings.

Abstract: Deep watermarking methods often share similar encoder-decoder architectures, yet differ substantially in their functional behaviors. We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.

TL;DR: C3PO framework reduces hallucinations in multimodal reasoning models through chain-of-thought compression and contrastive preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal reasoning models suffer from hallucinations, and existing solutions are insufficient. The paper identifies that reasoning mechanisms exacerbate reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, leading to hallucinations.

Method: C3PO framework with two components: 1) Chain-of-Thought Compression - selectively filters redundant thinking tokens for compact, signal-efficient CoT representations, 2) Contrastive Preference Optimization - uses reasoning-enhanced preference tuning with AI feedback and multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism to create informative negative signals for correction.

Result: Demonstrates consistent hallucination reduction across diverse multimodal reasoning models and benchmarks, with theoretical justification for effectiveness.

Conclusion: C3PO effectively mitigates hallucinations in multimodal reasoning models by addressing both reasoning trace quality and visual input utilization through compression and contrastive optimization techniques.

Abstract: While multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities, they remain prone to hallucinations, and effective solutions are still underexplored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze the hallucination cause and propose C3PO, a training-based mitigation framework comprising \textbf{C}hain-of-Thought \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization. Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks.

*Hyun Seok Seong,WonJun Moon,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRL introduces synergistic representation learning to break the vicious cycle between encoder and decoder in slot-based object-centric models, achieving state-of-the-art results by mutual refinement of sharp encoder features and spatially consistent decoder outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slot-based unsupervised object-centric learning models suffer from a fundamental conflict: encoder produces sharp, high-frequency attention maps while decoder produces spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps. This creates a vicious cycle where noisy encoder features force decoder to average, producing blurry outputs, and blurry reconstructions lack high-frequency details to supervise encoder features.

Method: Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) establishes a virtuous cycle where encoder and decoder mutually refine each other. Encoder's sharpness deblurs semantic boundaries in decoder output, while decoder's spatial consistency denoises encoder's features. Stabilized by warm-up phase with slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot.

Result: SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks by bridging the representational gap between encoder and decoder.

Conclusion: The proposed SRL framework successfully breaks the vicious cycle in slot-based object-centric learning by establishing mutual refinement between encoder and decoder, leading to improved performance on object-centric learning tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

*Piotr Wójcik,Maksym Petrenko,Wojciech Gromski,Przemysław Spurek,Maciej Zieba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnHype is a hypernetwork-based framework for machine unlearning in diffusion models that dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights for context-aware, scalable concept removal while maintaining overall generative capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about misuse of large-scale diffusion models for generating harmful content, and overcome limitations of existing LoRA-based unlearning methods which struggle with concept semantics, balancing related concepts, and scalability for multi-concept removal.

Method: Incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training, where a hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on CLIP embeddings during inference, enabling context-aware unlearning. The framework can be plugged into Stable Diffusion and modern flow-based text-to-image models.

Result: Demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control across challenging tasks including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, showing effectiveness and versatility in concept removal.

Conclusion: UnHype provides an effective solution for scalable, context-aware machine unlearning in diffusion models, addressing key limitations of existing LoRA-based approaches while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with geometric reasoning due to extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is expensive, automated methods lack fidelity, and existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or use inefficient random exploration.

Method: Multi-agent framework with three components: Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity); Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning; Generator learns image generation from accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets.

Result: Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using only one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new SOTA for open-source models and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).

Conclusion: Socratic-Geo demonstrates that autonomous multi-agent interaction can effectively address geometric reasoning bottlenecks in MLLMs by dynamically coupling data synthesis with model learning, achieving superior performance with minimal seed data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).

*Xiaofeng Tan,Jun Liu,Yuanting Fan,Bin-Bin Gao,Xi Jiang,Xiaochen Chen,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang,Hongsong Wang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConsistentRFT reduces visual hallucinations in flow-based models during reinforcement fine-tuning by addressing exploration-exploitation issues with dynamic granularity rollouts and consistent policy gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models often introduces visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment, which degrade output quality. The paper aims to understand why these hallucinations occur and develop methods to reduce them.

Method: Proposes ConsistentRFT framework with two key components: 1) Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism that balances exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources during SDE rollouts, and 2) Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves model consistency by aligning current policy with a more stable prior to avoid distortion of the foundational vector field.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConsistentRFT significantly reduces visual hallucinations - achieving average reductions of 49% for low-level and 38% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. It also outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing 5.1% improvement over FLUX1.dev (vs baseline's -0.4% decrease).

Conclusion: ConsistentRFT effectively addresses the core problems of limited exploration and trajectory imitation in RFT methods, providing a general framework to mitigate visual hallucinations while maintaining or improving performance on out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\% for low-level and 38\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\%) over FLUX1.dev.

TL;DR: CAG framework improves multi-subject image generation by providing explicit hierarchical guidance from concepts to appearances, addressing identity inconsistency and compositional control issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject image generation methods suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control because they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images, lacking explicit structured supervision.

Method: Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG) with two key components: 1) VAE dropout training at conceptual level to encourage reliance on robust semantic signals from Visual Language Model, 2) Correspondence-aware masked attention module at appearance level that restricts text tokens to attend only to matched reference regions.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Explicit hierarchical guidance from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances effectively addresses identity inconsistency and compositional control problems in multi-subject image generation.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.

TL;DR: CoViP is a framework that enables vision-language models to generate personalized responses by associating new images with users' accumulated visual-textual context, addressing the challenge of contextualized visual personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models fail to generate personalized responses based on users' specific experiences because they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with users' accumulated visual-textual context. The paper formalizes this as "contextualized visual personalization."

Method: Proposes CoViP framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task, improves capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation, and introduces diagnostic evaluations to rule out textual shortcuts.

Result: Extensive experiments show existing VLMs have substantial limitations, while CoViP improves personalized image captioning and yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks.

Conclusion: CoViP represents a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization, addressing a key limitation in current vision-language models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InlierQ is a post-training quantization method for object detection that separates task-irrelevant anomalies from informative inliers using gradient-aware volume saliency and EM algorithm, reducing quantization error with minimal calibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection has high computational demands making deployment slow and power-hungry. Task-irrelevant morphologies like background clutter and sensor noise create redundant activations that expand activation ranges and skew distributions toward irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening preservation of informative features.

Method: InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to suppress anomalies while preserving informative features. It's label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples.

Result: Experiments on COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

Conclusion: InlierQ effectively addresses the challenge of distinguishing anomalies from informative inliers in object detection quantization, providing a practical solution that improves quantization performance with minimal calibration requirements.

Abstract: Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

Motivation: Table image reasoning is challenging for LVLMs due to complex layouts and coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions rely on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability.

Method: Two-part framework: 1) DiSCo (Disentangled Structure-Content alignment) separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment; 2) Table-GLS (Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning) performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show the framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, with particular strength in generalizing to unseen table structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully adapts LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools, addressing the key challenge of complex table layouts through disentangled structure-content alignment and guided reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information.

Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a normalized convex fusion framework with lightweight gates to dynamically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states for DiT-based text-to-image generation, finding depth-wise semantic routing superior to time-wise fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DiT models use static text conditioning with only single LLM layers, despite semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and dynamic denoising processes over diffusion time and network depth. There's a need to better match the dynamic generation process.

Method: Proposes a unified normalized convex fusion framework with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states through time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion strategies.

Result: Depth-wise semantic routing consistently improves text-image alignment and compositional generation (+9.97 on GenAI-Bench Counting task). Time-wise fusion paradoxically degrades visual fidelity due to train-inference trajectory mismatch under classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: Depth-wise routing is a strong baseline for dynamic text conditioning in DiT models, highlighting the need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.

Abstract: Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection only provides binary decisions without indicating which logical rules are broken, offering limited value for quality assurance in industrial settings where understanding specific constraint violations is crucial.

Method: Proposes LogiCls framework that: 1) Decomposes logical constraints into sequence of verifiable subqueries, 2) Uses data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline to generate chain-of-thought supervision, 3) Employs precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt VLMs, 4) Implements difficulty-aware resampling strategy to emphasize challenging subqueries and long tail constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.

Conclusion: LogiCls successfully unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step, offering a practical solution for industrial quality assurance with interpretable reasoning about logical constraint violations.

Abstract: Logical anomalies are violations of predefined constraints on object quantity, spatial layout, and compositional relationships in industrial images. While prior work largely treats anomaly detection as a binary decision, such formulations cannot indicate which logical rule is broken and therefore offer limited value for quality assurance. We introduce Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), a task that unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step. To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified 3D frameworks using autoregressive paradigms suffer from performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and high training costs. The authors aim to enable effective information interaction between 3D understanding and generation while preserving model capabilities and leveraging pretrained models.

Method: Combines autoregressive next-token prediction for 3D understanding with continuous diffusion for 3D generation. Uses a lightweight transformer to bridge feature spaces between large language models and 3D diffusion models, enabling cross-modal information exchange while preserving learned priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, and excels in 3D editing tasks. Demonstrates the effectiveness of the unified AR+diffusion approach.

Conclusion: The AR+diffusion unified framework represents a promising direction for building general-purpose 3D intelligence, enabling effective information interaction between understanding and generation while minimizing performance compromises and training costs.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence.

TL;DR: CDGS is a constrained optimization framework for dynamic Gaussian splatting that enforces strict Gaussian budgets during training through differentiable budget control and adaptive allocation between static/dynamic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting faces a deployment dilemma: unconstrained densification causes excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, while heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets.

Method: Proposes Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS) with: 1) Differentiable budget controller guided by multi-modal unified importance score (geometric, motion, perceptual cues), 2) Decoupled optimization of static/dynamic elements with adaptive allocation based on motion complexity, 3) Three-phase training strategy to integrate constraints, 4) Dual-mode hybrid compression scheme.

Result: CDGS strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%), pushes Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance, achieves over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods, and delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits.

Conclusion: CDGS successfully resolves the deployment dilemma of dynamic Gaussian splatting by formulating it as a budget-constrained optimization problem, enabling high-quality 4D reconstruction within strict memory constraints suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Deep learning for multi-organ segmentation requires large annotated datasets, but clinical data is often scarce. Traditional data augmentation uses basic intra-image operations, while inter-image augmentation strategies that combine elements from different images are under-explored for organ segmentation.

Method: The study evaluates four inter-image data augmentation strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug, and AnatoMix on two organ segmentation datasets. These methods combine elements from different images to create new training samples, and are compared against state-of-the-art nnUNet without augmentation.

Result: CutMix, CarveMix, and AnatoMix improved average dice scores by 4.9, 2.0, and 1.9 respectively compared to nnUNet without augmentation. Performance further improved when combined with traditional data augmentation. CutMix proved most robust despite creating intuitively "wrong" images.

Conclusion: Inter-image data augmentation strategies, particularly CutMix, significantly improve multi-organ segmentation performance with limited data. CutMix's effectiveness even with unrealistic image combinations suggests it provides valuable regularization. The findings offer practical solutions for data-scarce medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.

Conclusion: ELIQ provides a practical solution for label-free quality assessment of continuously evolving AI-generated images, paving the way for scalable evaluation without human annotations.

Abstract: Generative text-to-image models are advancing at an unprecedented pace, continuously shifting the perceptual quality ceiling and rendering previously collected labels unreliable for newer generations. To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models. The code will be released upon publication.

### [85] [SlowFocus: Enhancing Fine-grained Temporal Understanding in Video LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03589)
*Ming Nie,Dan Ding,Chunwei Wang,Yuanfan Guo,Jianhua Han,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlowFocus mechanism enhances video LLMs by combining local high-frequency sampling with global low-frequency context for fine-grained temporal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs struggle to balance frame-level semantic quality (tokens per frame) with video-level temporal coverage (frames per video), limiting fine-grained video understanding capabilities.

Method: Introduces SlowFocus mechanism: 1) identifies query-related temporal segments, 2) performs dense sampling on these segments for local high-frequency features, 3) uses multi-frequency mixing attention to aggregate local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts, 4) implements training strategies for temporal grounding and reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates superiority across existing public video understanding benchmarks and the proposed FineAction-CGR benchmark for fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

Conclusion: SlowFocus effectively addresses the trade-off between frame-level quality and temporal coverage in Video LLMs, enabling enhanced fine-grained video understanding through multi-frequency temporal processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.

Method: Proposes DeepTopo-Net with two key components: 1) Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP) using Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields, and 2) Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) to maintain structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Also introduces GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark for marine vertical zonation.

Result: Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and the proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns.

Conclusion: DeepTopo-Net effectively addresses challenges in underwater camouflaged object detection through topology-aware modeling and frequency-decoupled perception, with the new GBU-UCOD benchmark filling data gaps for hadal and abyssal zones.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) is a challenging task due to the extreme visual similarity between targets and backgrounds across varying marine depths. Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields.

### [87] [TIPS Over Tricks: Simple Prompts for Effective Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03594)
*Alireza Salehi,Ehsan Karami,Sepehr Noey,Sahand Noey,Makoto Yamada,Reshad Hosseini,Mohammad Sabokrou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TIPSomaly, a zero-shot anomaly detection method that uses the TIPS vision-language model instead of CLIP, addressing spatial misalignment and fine-grained sensitivity issues through decoupled prompts and local evidence injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods using CLIP suffer from spatial misalignment and weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies. While prior work adds complex auxiliary modules, they overlook backbone choice. TIPS offers better spatial awareness but introduces a distributional gap between global and local features.

Method: Uses TIPS as backbone instead of CLIP. Introduces decoupled prompts: fixed prompts for image-level detection and learnable prompts for pixel-level localization. Injects local evidence into global anomaly scores to bridge the distributional gap between global and local features.

Result: Improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets. Achieves strong generalization with a lean architecture without CLIP-specific tricks.

Conclusion: Revisiting the backbone choice to TIPS and addressing its distributional gap through decoupled prompts and local evidence injection significantly improves zero-shot anomaly detection performance while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Abstract: Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

TL;DR: Refer-Agent: A collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms for zero-shot Referring Video Object Segmentation, outperforming both supervised fine-tuning and existing zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods rely heavily on large-scale supervised fine-tuning of MLLMs, which suffers from data dependence and limited scalability. Zero-shot approaches offer flexibility but underperform due to simplistic workflow designs.

Method: Proposes Refer-Agent, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. Features: 1) Coarse-to-Fine frame selection for diversity and textual relevance, 2) Dynamic Focus Layout for adaptive visual attention, 3) Chain-of-Reflection mechanism using Questioner-Responder pair for self-verification and feedback generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks show Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. The system is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Refer-Agent provides an effective zero-shot solution for RVOS that overcomes limitations of both supervised fine-tuning and existing zero-shot methods, offering superior performance, flexibility, and scalability without fine-tuning costs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos based on textual queries. Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education by providing modular implementations that show how representation learning techniques can transfer from images to video and action-conditioned world models, with practical single-GPU training.

Method: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) that learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding generative modeling pitfalls. The library provides implementations for image-level self-supervised learning, video with temporal dynamics, and action-conditioned world models that predict effects of control inputs.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy on CIFAR-10 probing, demonstrating useful feature learning. Multi-step prediction on Moving MNIST shows scalability to temporal modeling. Action-conditioned world models achieved 97% planning success rate on Two Rooms navigation task. Ablations reveal critical importance of regularization components for preventing representation collapse.

Conclusion: EB-JEPA successfully demonstrates that JEPA-based representation learning techniques can effectively transfer from images to video and action-conditioned world models, providing accessible, modular implementations for research and education with practical training requirements.

Abstract: We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KTV is a two-stage training-free video understanding framework that first selects keyframes via clustering to reduce redundancy, then prunes visual tokens to cut computational costs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free video understanding suffers from visual redundancy, high computational overhead, and biased keyframe selection that overlooks critical frames, leading to suboptimal video comprehension.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Question-agnostic keyframe selection via clustering frame-level visual features to get compact, diverse, representative frames; 2) Key visual token selection pruning redundant/informative tokens based on importance and redundancy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines on Multiple-Choice VideoQA using significantly fewer visual tokens (only 504 tokens for 60-min video with 10800 frames), achieving 44.8% accuracy on MLVU-Test benchmark. Also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.

Conclusion: KTV provides an efficient and effective training-free video understanding solution that addresses redundancy and computational overhead while maintaining strong performance, even competing with training-based methods.

Abstract: Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal framework for retinal disease classification using synthesized FFA, MSI, and saliency maps, with adaptive feature calibration and cross-modal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal retinal diagnosis faces challenges like data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, and registration complexity, necessitating a unified framework that can integrate multimodal data synthesis and fusion for improved disease classification.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with: 1) synthesized multimodal data (FFA, MSI, saliency maps highlighting lesions and optic disc/cup regions), 2) parallel models for modality-specific representation learning, 3) adaptive feature calibration within and across modalities for information pruning and flexible integration, and 4) thorough visual interpretation in image and feature spaces.

Result: Superior performance on two public datasets: multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy: 0.842, Kappa: 0.861), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances retinal disease screening accuracy and efficiency while providing a scalable approach for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities, addressing key challenges in multimodal ophthalmic diagnosis.

Abstract: Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.

TL;DR: Evolutionary optimization of style transfer pipelines for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, using multi-objective genetic algorithms to balance structural coherence and style similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires pixel-level annotations that are expensive for real images. Synthetic data from game engines is available but suffers from domain gap. Style transfer can bridge this gap, but designing effective transformation pipelines is challenging due to large combinatorial search space.

Method: Use multi-objective genetic algorithms to optimize style transfer pipelines, balancing structural coherence and style similarity. Employ paired-image metrics on individual samples during evolution for rapid evaluation, instead of distributional metrics requiring many images. Evaluate Pareto front with distributional metrics and segmentation performance.

Result: Applied to GTA5→Cityscapes/ACDC domain adaptation, focusing on adverse conditions. Evolutionary algorithms produced diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. Demonstrated effectiveness of evolutionary optimization for style transfer sequencing.

Conclusion: Formulated style transfer as sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization. Studied efficient metrics enabling feasible search. Evolutionary approach can generate diverse, effective pipelines for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

TL;DR: SPWOOD is the first sparse partial weakly-supervised oriented object detection framework that uses only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data to reduce annotation costs in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing object detection faces prohibitively high annotation costs due to dense object distribution and wide category variety. Existing methods require extensive labeling, so there's a need for approaches that work with fewer and weaker annotations.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) SOS-Student model to separate unlabeled objects from background and learn from orientation/scale-agnostic weak annotations, (2) Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering using model prediction distributions from multi-layer predictions, (3) Sparse partitioning approach for equal category treatment.

Result: Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR datasets show significant performance gains over traditional oriented object detection methods, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Conclusion: SPWOOD framework successfully addresses large-scale labeling challenges in remote sensing by efficiently leveraging sparse weakly-labeled and unlabeled data, achieving strong performance with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

TL;DR: MM-SCALE introduces a multimodal moral reasoning dataset with 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding to better align VLMs with human moral preferences, moving beyond binary supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with morally salient judgments in multimodal contexts, and existing approaches use binary/pairwise supervision that fails to capture the continuous, pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning.

Method: Created MM-SCALE dataset with image-scenario pairs annotated with 5-point moral acceptability scores and explicit modality grounding using a tailored interface, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets.

Result: VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration compared to models trained with binary signals.

Conclusion: Scalar supervision provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration for multimodal moral reasoning, offering a better approach than discrete binary methods for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to struggle to make morally salient judgments in multimodal and socially ambiguous contexts. Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration than those trained with binary signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIAS introduces a language-guided industrial anomaly detection paradigm that uses text descriptions to generate precise anomaly masks without manual thresholds, enabling detection of diverse anomalies with a single model instead of the traditional "One Anomaly Class, One Model" approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional industrial anomaly detection methods face challenges: unsupervised approaches produce rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, supervised methods overfit due to scarce/imbalanced data, and both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation that requires separate models for different anomaly types.

Method: Proposes RIAS (Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation) paradigm using language to guide detection. Introduces MVTec-Ref dataset with diverse referring expressions focusing on anomaly patterns (95% small anomalies). Presents DQFormer (Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer) benchmark with Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) for multi-scale segmentation, using only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration.

Result: Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing industrial anomaly detection toward open-set capabilities, showing it can generate precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and detect diverse anomalies with a single model.

Conclusion: RIAS represents a paradigm shift in industrial anomaly detection by leveraging language guidance to overcome limitations of traditional methods, enabling more flexible and efficient detection of diverse anomalies with a single model while eliminating the need for manual thresholding.

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is vital for manufacturing, yet traditional methods face significant challenges: unsupervised approaches yield rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, while supervised methods overfit due to scarce, imbalanced data. Both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration.

TL;DR: RegionReasoner: RL framework for multi-round visual reasoning with explicit region grounding and global-local consistency rewards, evaluated on new RegionDial-Bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, lacking iterative refinement across multiple visual contexts, limiting their ability to perform complex visual reasoning.

Method: Propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring explicit citation of reference bounding boxes in reasoning traces, with global-local consistency reward that aligns key objects/nouns from scene and region captions with reasoning steps.

Result: RegionReasoner-7B with RegionDial-Bench benchmark significantly improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency on detection and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: RegionReasoner establishes a strong baseline for multi-round visual reasoning with explicit spatial grounding and semantic consistency, addressing limitations of existing single-step reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have achieved remarkable progress in visual reasoning, yet most existing systems rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, limiting their ability to iteratively refine understanding across multiple visual contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment. Experiments on detection and segmentation tasks show that RegionReasoner-7B, together with our newly introduced benchmark RegionDial-Bench, considerably improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency, establishing a strong baseline for this emerging research direction.

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline combining lightweight segmentation (RAPID-SCAN) with fine-tuned VLM for real-time defect summarization on edge devices in underground infrastructure inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated generation of human-readable summaries from robotic visual inspections remains challenging on resource-constrained edge devices, creating a gap between defect detection and actionable maintenance insights.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) RAPID-SCAN segmentation model (0.64M params, 0.834 F1-score) for defect detection, 2) Fine-tuned Phi-3.5 Vision-Language Model for natural language summarization. Uses post-training quantization and hardware optimization for edge deployment.

Result: Deployed on mobile robotic platform with real-time performance, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. Created curated dataset for VLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Edge-deployable integrated AI systems can bridge automated defect detection and actionable maintenance insights, enabling scalable autonomous inspection solutions for underground infrastructure.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIVE introduces a cycle-consistency objective for autoregressive video world models to bound error accumulation in long-horizon video generation, eliminating need for teacher distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video world models struggle with long-horizon generation due to error accumulation over time. Prior methods use teacher models and distribution matching, which are computationally expensive and don't prevent error propagation beyond training horizons.

Method: LIVE enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective: performs forward rollout from ground-truth frames, then reverse generation to reconstruct initial state, computing diffusion loss on reconstructed terminal state. Also introduces progressive training curriculum for stability.

Result: LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.

Conclusion: The cycle-consistency approach effectively bounds error accumulation in long-horizon video generation without teacher distillation, providing a unified framework for different approaches and enabling stable training.

Abstract: Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current professional workflows for animating static anime illustrations require tedious manual segmentation and artistic "hallucination" of occluded regions, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Method: Decomposes single images into inpainted semantic layers with inferred drawing orders using a scalable engine that bootstraps supervision from commercial Live2D models. Combines diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module for global geometric coherence with pixel-level pseudo-depth inference.

Result: The approach successfully resolves intricate stratification of anime characters (like interleaving hair strands) and produces high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional real-time animation applications.

Conclusion: The framework automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into 2.5D models, overcoming manual workflow limitations and enabling professional animation applications through data-efficient training and sophisticated layer decomposition.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models. Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot LVLM approach for automatic bone, projection view, and laterality identification in heterogeneous paleoradiology images achieves 92%, 80%, and 100% accuracy respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paleoradiology images are highly heterogeneous (disarticulated bones, ad hoc positioning, missing laterality markers) with high variability from factors like age, sex, and equipment. Manual content navigation and triaging is time-consuming and difficult, creating bottlenecks for expert analysis.

Method: Zero-shot prompting strategy using state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone-windowed PNGs, submits them to LVLM with carefully engineered prompts, receives structured JSON outputs, and formats results onto spreadsheets for validation.

Result: On 100 expert-reviewed images: 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, 100% laterality accuracy. System includes low/medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, enabling efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

Abstract: Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

TL;DR: REPA-G is an inference-time guidance framework that uses aligned representations from self-supervised models to condition diffusion models, enabling versatile control from fine-grained textures to broad semantics without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While representation alignment has improved diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains unexplored. Current methods rely on ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels, lacking precise control over generation.

Method: REPA-G optimizes a similarity objective (potential) at inference time to steer the denoising process toward conditioned representations from pre-trained feature extractors. It enables multi-scale control from single patches to global image features and supports multi-concept composition.

Result: Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate high-quality, diverse generations. The method provides flexible and precise control compared to text prompts or class labels, with theoretical justification for sampling from potential-induced tilted distributions.

Conclusion: REPA-G offers a versatile inference-time framework for precise conditioning in diffusion models using aligned representations, enabling multi-scale control and multi-concept composition without retraining.

Abstract: While representation alignment with self-supervised models has been shown to improve diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains largely unexplored. We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations. Code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/REPA-G.

TL;DR: RAWDet-7 is a large-scale RAW image dataset with object detection annotations and descriptions, enabling research on machine vision using unprocessed sensor data instead of human-optimized RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision models use RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which discards sensor-level information that could be useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data with richer cues for object detection and description.

Method: Introduced RAWDet-7 dataset with ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments. Images are densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions, with object-level descriptions derived from corresponding high-resolution sRGB images.

Result: Created a benchmark dataset that enables evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization to reflect realistic sensor constraints. The dataset supports studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

Conclusion: RAWDet-7 provides a valuable resource for research on machine vision using RAW images, allowing investigation of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and quantization, with potential to improve machine reasoning by leveraging richer sensor-level data.

Abstract: Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

TL;DR: FOVI: A foveated vision interface inspired by human retina/V1 that reformats variable-resolution sensor data into uniform manifold for efficient kNN-convolution, enabling competitive performance at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human vision uses foveated sensing with variable resolution for efficient active sensing, while most computer vision systems use uniform resolution, making full-field high-resolution image processing computationally expensive.

Method: Propose FOVI that reformats retina-like variable-resolution sensor array into uniformly dense V1-like manifold, uses k-nearest-neighborhoods as receptive fields, and implements kNN-convolution via novel kernel mapping technique. Two implementations: end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture and foveated adaptation of DINOv3 ViT using LoRA.

Result: Models achieve competitive performance at a fraction of computational cost compared to non-foveated baselines, enabling efficient active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Conclusion: FOVI provides efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution vision, bridging biological efficiency with computer vision systems through foveated processing inspired by human visual system.

Abstract: Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain shift during neurosurgery invalidates preoperative MRI guidance, creating need for intraoperative brain shift compensation to enhance neuronavigation precision and surgical outcomes.

Method: U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from preoperative MRI for temporal lobe resection patients, evaluated using Target Registration Errors (TREs) on anatomical landmarks and DICE scores comparing predicted vs. actual intraoperative masks.

Result: Model predicts global brain deformation with DICE of 0.97 and accurate local displacements achieving landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm, effectively compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal.

Conclusion: The model can predict brain deformation during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, offering potential to increase neurosurgery safety and efficiency while improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Introduction: In neurosurgery, image-guided Neurosurgery Systems (IGNS) highly rely on preoperative brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) to assist surgeons in locating surgical targets and determining surgical paths. However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients. Our contributions will be publicly available after acceptance in https://github.com/SurgicalDataScienceKCL/NeuralShift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DiMo: A 3D-aware motion control method for video generation that uses implicit, view-agnostic motion tokens instead of explicit 3D models, enabling flexible camera control and novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: 2D poses restrict motion to driving viewpoint, preventing novel-view synthesis, while explicit 3D models (like SMPL) have inherent inaccuracies that override the generator's intrinsic 3D awareness. There's a need for motion control that aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on external constraints.

Method: Jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens injected via cross-attention. Uses view-rich supervision (single-view, multi-view, moving-camera videos) for 3D awareness, and auxiliary geometric supervision with SMPL for early initialization that anneals to zero, transitioning from external guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding.

Result: 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates that implicit, view-agnostic motion representation aligned with generator priors enables superior motion control for video generation with flexible camera manipulation.

Abstract: Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficiently sampling independent locations in parallel while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning in autoregressive image generation.

Method: Uses a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. The ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on class-conditional ImageNet compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with similar model capacity, using fewer sampling steps. Finds evidence that a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results when total serial steps are constant.

Conclusion: Progressive checkerboard ordering provides an effective approach for balancing parallel sampling with serial conditioning in multiscale autoregressive models, enabling efficient image generation with competitive performance.

Abstract: A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.

TL;DR: DualSpeed: A fast-slow training framework for MLLMs that uses visual token pruning for efficiency while maintaining performance through dual-mode training and self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from severe training inefficiency due to massive model sizes and visual token numbers. While visual token pruning improves inference efficiency, applying it during training creates a training-inference mismatch where models perform poorly on full visual sequences during inference.

Method: DualSpeed framework with two modes: 1) Fast-mode (primary) uses visual token pruning methods as plugins with mode isolator to isolate behaviors, 2) Slow-mode (auxiliary) trains on full visual sequences to maintain training-inference consistency, enhanced by self-distillation from the fast-mode.

Result: DualSpeed accelerates LLaVA-1.5 training by 2.1× and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0× while retaining over 99% performance compared to full training.

Conclusion: DualSpeed successfully addresses the training-inference mismatch problem in visual token pruning for MLLMs, achieving both training efficiency and non-degraded performance through its dual-mode framework with self-distillation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\times$, retaining over 99% performance. Code: https://github.com/dingkun-zhang/DualSpeed

TL;DR: AdaOr introduces adaptive-origin guidance for smooth text-guided image/video editing by adjusting the unconditional prediction with identity-conditioned guidance, enabling continuous control over edit intensity without specialized datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editing models lack smooth intensity control for text-guided edits. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) affects prompt adherence in generation, scaling CFG in editing models doesn't produce smooth transitions between input and edited results due to the unconditional prediction dominating at low scales.

Method: Proposes Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr) that replaces the standard unconditional prediction guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin. Uses an identity instruction corresponding to identity manipulation, and interpolates between identity prediction and standard unconditional prediction based on edit strength to ensure continuous transitions.

Result: Evaluation on image and video editing tasks shows AdaOr provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Enables fine-grained control at inference without per-edit procedures or specialized datasets.

Conclusion: AdaOr successfully enables continuous control over edit intensity in diffusion-based editing models by addressing the limitations of standard CFG scaling through adaptive guidance origins, offering practical smooth editing control for real applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

Method: Combines 3D signed distance function (SDF) and density field learning with event-based supervision. Introduces spherical harmonics encodings to handle view-dependent effects. Uses self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular color event streams.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches by significant margin: 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to best previous method.

Conclusion: EventNeuS successfully addresses limitations in event-based 3D reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy by combining SDF/density field learning with event-based supervision and spherical harmonics encodings.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.

### [110] [CreditAudit: 2D Auditing for LLM Evaluation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02515)
*Yiliang Song,Hongjun An,Jiangong Xiao,Haofei Zhao,Jiawei Shao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CreditAudit is a deployment-oriented framework that evaluates LLMs not just on mean performance but also on stability across different system prompts, providing credit grades (AAA-BBB) to guide real-world deployment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark scores show marginal differences between frontier models but don't reflect real-world deployment reliability, as small system prompt changes can cause disproportionate failures in agentic pipelines, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy.

Method: Evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned, non-adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, measuring both mean ability (average performance) and scenario-induced fluctuation sigma (stability risk), then maps volatility into interpretable credit grades (AAA to BBB) using cross-model quantiles with diagnostics to mitigate template difficulty drift.

Result: Models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes, as shown in controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro.

Conclusion: CreditAudit provides a 2D and grade-based language for regime-specific model selection, supporting tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing/monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real-world use.

Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolver is a self-evolving multi-agent system that enables LLM agents to acquire Earth Observation expertise through structured interaction without parameter updates, improving task success by 12% on EO benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains like Earth Observation that require long-horizon execution, multi-modal coordination, and adherence to implicit tool constraints. They lack mechanisms to learn fine-grained tool-level expertise from interaction, limiting their ability to configure parameters and recover from failures in complex EO workflows.

Method: GeoEvolver uses a self-evolving multi-agent system with: 1) retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator to decompose queries into independent sub-goals, 2) exploration of diverse tool-parameter configurations at sub-goal level, and 3) evolving memory bank that distills successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures to provide in-context demonstrations for future queries.

Result: Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success with an average gain of 12% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions.

Conclusion: GeoEvolver enables LLM agents to acquire Earth Observation expertise through structured interaction without parameter updates, addressing the challenge of tool-intensive domains by allowing agents to learn fine-grained tool-level expertise and improve execution reliability in complex workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled large language model (LLM) agents to solve complex tasks by orchestrating external tools. However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment.

### [112] [Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582)
*Chandan Kumar Sah,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang,Tony Xu,Syed Shazaib Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on uncertainty quantification and fairness assessment across demographic attributes, with empirical analysis showing systematic biases in Gemini 1.5 Flash that persist despite prompt variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs enable powerful zero-shot recommendations, their predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. There's a need to systematically evaluate how uncertainty and fairness affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark with curated metrics and a dataset annotated for 8 demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across movies and music domains. They quantify predictive uncertainty via entropy, conduct in-depth case studies on Gemini 1.5 Flash, test prompt perturbations (typos, multilingual inputs), and integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline.

Result: Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes (SNSR: 0.1363, SNSV: 0.0507). Disparities persist under prompt perturbations. Personality-linked bias patterns are revealed, exposing trade-offs between personalization and group fairness.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs through a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology, empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.

*Yanki Margalit,Erni Avram,Ran Taig,Oded Margalit,Nurit Cohen-Inger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PeerRank is an autonomous LLM evaluation framework where models generate tasks, answer with web grounding, judge peers, and aggregate assessments without human supervision or gold references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation relies on human-authored benchmarks and judgments that scale poorly, become outdated quickly, and mismatch real-world deployments that use web retrieval and synthesis.

Method: PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator. Models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses, and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates.

Result: In a study with 12 commercial models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produced stable, discriminative rankings and revealed measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings were robust and mean peer scores agreed with Elo ratings. Validation on TruthfulQA and GSM8K showed peer scores correlate with objective accuracy.

Conclusion: Bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static, human-curated benchmarks, enabling autonomous evaluation that matches real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models typically relies on human-authored benchmarks, reference answers, and human or single-model judgments, approaches that scale poorly, become quickly outdated, and mismatch open-world deployments that depend on web retrieval and synthesis. We introduce PeerRank, a fully autonomous end-to-end evaluation framework in which models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates, without human supervision or gold references. PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy. Together, these results suggest that bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static and human curated benchmarks.

### [114] [A Positive Case for Faithfulness: LLM Self-Explanations Help Predict Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02639)
*Harry Mayne,Justin Singh Kang,Dewi Gould,Kannan Ramchandran,Adam Mahdi,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM self-explanations improve prediction of model behavior by 11-37% (NSG metric), showing they encode useful information despite 5-15% being misleading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing faithfulness metrics for LLM self-explanations have critical limitations, typically relying on adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors, overlooking the predictive value of explanations.

Method: Introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG) - a general, scalable metric based on the idea that faithful explanations should allow observers to learn model's decision-making criteria and better predict behavior on related inputs. Evaluate 18 frontier models on 7,000 counterfactuals from datasets covering health, business, and ethics.

Result: Self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations provide more predictive information than external model explanations, even when external models are stronger. 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading across models.

Conclusion: Despite imperfections, self-explanations encode information that helps predict model behavior, showing a positive case for their use in AI oversight. Self-knowledge provides an advantage that external explanation methods cannot replicate.

Abstract: LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.

TL;DR: MARS is a modular AI research agent framework that uses budget-aware planning, modular construction, and comparative reflective memory to automate AI research more effectively than current LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with AI research automation due to computationally expensive evaluations (like model training) and opaque performance attribution. They often generate monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors.

Method: MARS uses three key components: 1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to balance performance with execution expense; 2) Modular Construction with a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; 3) Comparative Reflective Memory that analyzes solution differences to distill high-signal insights and address credit assignment.

Result: MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. The system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, with 63% of all utilized lessons originating from cross-branch transfer.

Conclusion: MARS effectively automates AI research by addressing key challenges of computational expense and performance attribution, demonstrating that the agent can generalize insights across search paths and achieve competitive performance.

Abstract: Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

*Ujin Jeon,Jiyong Kwon,Madison Ann Sullivan,Caleb Eunho Lee,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS is an adaptive multi-agent framework that evolves lightweight research agents using specialized supporter agents, with EvoDPO algorithm for adaptive reference policy updates, showing improved stability and performance over static single-agent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-LLM agent systems either keep solvers frozen after fine-tuning or use static preference-optimization loops, which become intractable for long-horizon tasks and lack adaptability to changing environments.

Method: ATLAS framework with task-distributed learning: lightweight research agent evolves iteratively while delegating roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Core algorithm EvoDPO adaptively updates phase-indexed reference policy with theoretical regret analysis for preference-based contextual bandits under concept drift.

Result: Experiments on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and SciML loss reweighting for 1D Burgers' equation show ATLAS improves stability and performance over static single-agent baselines.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides an effective adaptive framework for agent self-evolution through task distribution and specialized supporter agents, addressing limitations of static approaches in long-horizon tasks with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.

*Yuanzhe Li,Jianing Deng,Jingtong Hu,Tianlong Chen,Song Wang,Huanrui Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic mix-precision routing framework adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step to reduce inference costs while maintaining task success in long-horizon decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While larger LLMs achieve better performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks, multi-step interaction with large LLMs incurs prohibitive inference costs. There's a need to balance task success rate with computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step based on step sensitivity. Uses a two-stage training pipeline: 1) KL-divergence-based supervised learning to identify precision-sensitive steps, 2) Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve task success rates.

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate significant improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off compared to single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic mix-precision routing effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining high task success rates in long-horizon decision-making, offering a practical solution to the accuracy-cost trade-off problem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cuttlefish is a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while adaptively scaling structural tokens to overcome limitations of existing methods that either omit geometric information or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning over biomolecular structures with LLMs are modality-specific and compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. These approaches either omit geometric groundings needed to reduce structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, hindering generalized all-atom reasoning.

Method: Cuttlefish introduces two key components: 1) Scaling-Aware Patching uses an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling query token budget with structural complexity to avoid fixed-length bottlenecks. 2) Geometry Grounding Adapter refines adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues.

Result: Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Cuttlefish successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by providing a unified framework that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while adaptively scaling structural tokens, enabling more effective all-atom reasoning over biomolecular structures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.

### [119] [Chain of Simulation: A Dual-Mode Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models with Dynamic Problem Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02842)
*Saeid Sheikhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain of Simulation (CoS) is a dual-mode reasoning framework that dynamically routes problems to specialized reasoning strategies (computational, symbolic, hybrid) in LLMs, achieving significant accuracy improvements across mathematical, spatial, and multi-hop reasoning tasks with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uniform prompting approaches for LLMs fail to account for the diverse nature of reasoning problems, leading to suboptimal performance. Different problem types (mathematical, spatial, multi-hop) require specialized reasoning strategies, but current methods apply one-size-fits-all approaches.

Method: CoS employs three specialized reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. The framework includes algorithms for dynamic mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, routing problems to the most appropriate reasoning strategy.

Result: CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to strongest baselines. Computational mode achieves 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems. The framework provides superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, achieving comparable performance to Self-Consistency at 54% lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Problem-specific mode selection is crucial for effective LLM reasoning, with misrouting leading to 0% accuracy. CoS establishes an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training, demonstrating that dynamic routing to specialized reasoning strategies significantly outperforms uniform prompting approaches across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Chain of Simulation (CoS), a novel dual-mode reasoning framework that dynamically routes problems to specialized reasoning strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing uniform prompting approaches, CoS employs three distinct reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy. We provide detailed algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, establishing CoS as an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training. The framework provides superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to Self-Consistency, achieving comparable performance at 54% lower computational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoSizer is an LLM-driven meta-optimization framework for AMS circuit sizing that outperforms traditional methods by using reflective optimization with adaptive search-space refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMS circuit design relies heavily on expert knowledge with transistor sizing being a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing EDA methods treat sizing as static black-box optimization, leading to inefficient and less robust solutions. LLMs have strong reasoning abilities but aren't suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing.

Method: AutoSizer uses a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework with a two-loop optimization structure: inner loop for circuit sizing and outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. It unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop.

Result: The authors introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark with 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology. AutoSizer achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: AutoSizer successfully bridges the gap between LLM reasoning capabilities and precise numerical optimization for AMS circuit sizing, demonstrating superior performance through its reflective meta-optimization approach with adaptive search-space refinement.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints.

*Eric Yang,Jong Ha Lee,Jonathan Amar,Elissa Ye,Yugang Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEER is a training-free framework that enables tunable control over LLM decision conservativeness in ordinal settings like clinical triage, using evolutionary search to create diverse personas and exposing a single risk percentile parameter for steering behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained for average correctness suffer from mode collapse, losing the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity in ordinal decision settings like clinical triage where contextual constraints require adjustable decision conservativeness.

Method: STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through offline constrained quality-diversity search that ensures behavioral coverage while maintaining safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference, a single interpretable control parameter maps user-specified risk percentiles to selected personas for monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness.

Result: On clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage than temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to post-training methods, it maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions.

Conclusion: STEER provides a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control that can steer LLM behavior without compromising domain competence, reintroducing tunable control over decision conservativeness in critical applications like clinical triage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.

*Jinkun Chen,Fengxiang Cheng,Sijia Han,Vlado Keselj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs often fail mid-reasoning, not just at the end. This paper shows that inference-time token probabilities can detect these breakdowns without training, using a simple instability signal combining distributional shift and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM reasoning failures only looks at final outputs, but many failures occur mid-reasoning as the model "loses the thread." The authors want to detect these process-level breakdowns using only standard API observables without additional training.

Method: Define an instability signal combining consecutive-step distributional shift (Jensen-Shannon Divergence) and uncertainty (entropy). Summarize each reasoning trace by its peak instability strength. Analyze when instability occurs (early vs late) relative to the remaining decoding horizon.

Result: Instability strength reliably predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC across GSM8K and HotpotQA. Shows monotonic accuracy decline with increasing instability. Reveals two types: early "corrective instability" (followed by recovery) and late "destructive instability" (leading to failure), even at similar peak magnitudes.

Conclusion: Reasoning failures can be detected from inference-time observables without training. Timing matters: late instability is more harmful than early instability. The method provides a diagnostic lens for understanding reasoning breakdowns, not a corrective mechanism.

Abstract: Reasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of a generation, yet many failures manifest as a process-level breakdown: the model "loses the thread" mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or fine-tuning. We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (\emph{corrective instability}), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (\emph{destructive instability}), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as a diagnostic lens rather than a corrective or control mechanism.

*Marco Gutierrez,Xinyi Leng,Hannah Cyberey,Jonathan Richard Schwarz,Ahmed Alaa,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BenchAlign: A method to automatically update offline benchmarks using limited deployment data to better align with real-world model utility and human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model benchmarks often fail to predict real-world performance despite being computationally efficient. There's a gap between benchmark performance and actual utility in deployment settings.

Method: Proposes BenchAlign, which learns preference-aligned weightings for benchmark questions using question-level model performance and ranked model pairs collected during deployment. Creates new static benchmarks that rank unseen models according to human preferences.

Result: Aligned benchmarks accurately rank unseen models according to human preference models across different model sizes while remaining interpretable.

Conclusion: Benchmark alignment can bridge the gap between offline benchmarks and real-world utility, accelerating model development toward practical human preferences.

Abstract: Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.

*Hongju Pae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper proposes implementing subjective perspective in AI agents using a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics, showing direction-dependent hysteresis as a measurable signature of machine subjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To operationalize subjective perspective in artificial agents by grounding it in a minimal, phenomenologically motivated internal structure that captures the essence of subjective experience in machines.

Method: Implement perspective as a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics without direct optimization for behavioral consequences. Test in reward-free environment with regime shifts.

Result: The latent structure exhibits direction-dependent hysteresis while policy-level behavior remains reactive. This hysteresis is argued to be a measurable signature of perspective-like subjectivity in machine systems.

Conclusion: Direction-dependent hysteresis in a slowly evolving latent state that modulates policy dynamics constitutes a measurable operationalization of subjective perspective in artificial agents, providing a foundation for studying machine subjectivity.

Abstract: This study operationalizes subjective perspective in artificial agents by grounding it in a minimal, phenomenologically motivated internal structure. The perspective is implemented as a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics without being directly optimized for behavioral consequences. In a reward-free environment with regime shifts, this latent structure exhibits direction-dependent hysteresis, while policy-level behavior remains comparatively reactive. I argue that such hysteresis constitutes a measurable signature of perspective-like subjectivity in machine systems.

### [125] [FIRE-Bench: Evaluating Agents on the Rediscovery of Scientific Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02905)
*Zhen Wang,Fan Bai,Zhongyan Luo,Jinyan Su,Kaiser Sun,Xinle Yu,Jieyuan Liu,Kun Zhou,Claire Cardie,Mark Dredze,Eric P. Xing,Zhiting Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRE-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-powered autonomous agents on full-cycle scientific discovery by having them rediscover established findings from recent ML research, revealing current limitations in experimental design and evidence-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-powered scientific agents face a trade-off: they either rely too heavily on LLM-as-judge evaluations of generated outputs, or they optimize convenient but isolated performance metrics that serve as coarse proxies for actual scientific insight. There's a need for a more rigorous evaluation framework that measures agents' capacity for verifiable, end-to-end scientific discovery.

Method: The authors introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), which evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question from a published, verified study and must autonomously: explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLM backbones (like GPT-5) on FIRE-Bench shows that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning.

Conclusion: FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery, highlighting that current agent systems still struggle with comprehensive scientific research despite advances in LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.

### [126] [Reasoning about Reasoning: BAPO Bounds on Chain-of-Thought Token Complexity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02909)
*Kiran Tomlinson,Tobias Schnabel,Adith Swaminathan,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves fundamental lower bounds on chain-of-thought reasoning tokens required for canonical tasks, showing Ω(n) tokens needed for binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability with input size n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning improves LLM performance but incurs substantial latency and compute costs. The paper aims to understand the fundamental computational requirements: how many reasoning tokens are needed as input size grows, providing theoretical foundations for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

Method: Extends the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model to quantify information flow required for tasks. Proves lower bounds on CoT tokens for three BAPO-hard tasks using theoretical analysis, complements with matching/near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions, and validates with experiments on frontier reasoning models.

Result: Proves Ω(n) reasoning tokens required for binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability with input size n. Shows matching or near-matching upper bounds, and experimental results demonstrate approximately linear reasoning token scaling and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets.

Conclusion: The paper identifies fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through chain-of-thought reasoning and provides a principled theoretical tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length, establishing that certain tasks inherently require linear reasoning tokens relative to input size.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $Ω(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

### [127] [DeltaEvolve: Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Momentum-Driven Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02919)
*Jiachen Jiang,Tianyu Ding,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaEvolve: A momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta for more efficient LLM-driven program evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven evolutionary systems like AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and provide weak evolutionary guidance. Full-code snapshots contain redundant implementation details that dilute core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution.

Method: Proposes DeltaEvolve framework that formalizes evolutionary agents as Expectation-Maximization: LLM samples candidate programs (E-step) and system updates control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Instead of full-code history, uses structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. Organizes semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism to reduce input tokens.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse scientific domains show DeltaEvolve can discover better solutions with less token consumption compared to full-code-based evolutionary agents.

Conclusion: Structured semantic delta provides more informative evolutionary guidance than full-code histories, enabling more efficient LLM-driven program evolution through better context construction and reduced token usage.

Abstract: LLM-driven evolutionary systems have shown promise for automated science discovery, yet existing approaches such as AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and potentially provide weak evolutionary guidance. In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.

*Elias Hossain,Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Subash Neupane,Rajib Rana,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv,Ivan Garibay,Niloofar Yousefi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UAT-LITE is an inference-time framework that makes transformer self-attention uncertainty-aware using Monte Carlo dropout, improving calibration without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated (assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions), which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Existing calibration methods either only adjust output probabilities without changing internal computation, or require substantial training/storage costs.

Method: UAT-LITE uses approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization. Also introduces layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose uncertainty accumulation across transformer depth.

Result: Across SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by ~20% on average relative to fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy. Improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.

Conclusion: UAT-LITE provides an effective inference-time framework for making transformer self-attention uncertainty-aware, improving calibration and uncertainty estimation without modifying pretrained weights or requiring expensive training procedures.

Abstract: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions, which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Post-hoc calibration methods adjust output probabilities but leave internal computation unchanged, while ensemble and Bayesian approaches improve uncertainty at substantial training or storage cost. We propose UAT-LITE, an inference-time framework that makes self-attention uncertainty-aware using approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization, without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives. We additionally introduce a layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose how predictive uncertainty accumulates across transformer depth. Across the SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 20% on average relative to a fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy, and improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.

### [129] [Generative Engine Optimization: A VLM and Agent Framework for Pinterest Acquisition Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02961)
*Faye Zhang,Qianyu Cheng,Jasmine Wan,Vishwakarma Singh,Jinfeng Rao,Kofi Boakye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pinterest developed a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) framework using reverse search design: fine-tuning VLMs to predict user search queries, creating semantically coherent collection pages, and building authority-aware interlinking structures to optimize visual content for generative AI search systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search engines are being replaced by AI-native systems (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) that generate answers directly rather than linking to documents. Visual platforms like Pinterest face disintermediation risk because individual images lack semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, potentially satisfying user needs without site visits.

Method: 1) Fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would search for (reverse search design) rather than generating generic image captions. 2) Augment with AI agents mining real-time internet trends. 3) Use VLM-generated queries to create semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings. 4) Build authority-aware interlinking structures using hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures across billions of visual assets.

Result: Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth.

Conclusion: Pinterest GEO demonstrates a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era by optimizing visual content for AI-native search systems through reverse search design, semantic collection creation, and authority-aware interlinking.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping content discovery through AI-native search systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.
  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era.

*Zuyuan Zhang,Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCR-RL uses order theory to frame RL as learning partially ordered sets, enforcing geometric coherence through super-poset refinements to improve sample efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric properties can stabilize and speed up reinforcement learning, but existing approaches focus on symmetry, data augmentation, or structural restrictions. The authors propose a novel order theory perspective to leverage geometric coherence in value function learning.

Method: GCR-RL (Geometric Coherence Regularized RL) frames value function estimation as learning a desired poset. It computes super-poset refinements by refining posets from previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals, ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets. Two algorithms are developed: one via Q-learning and another via actor-critic.

Result: Theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. Empirical evaluation across tasks shows significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.

Conclusion: Viewing RL through order theory and enforcing geometric coherence via super-poset refinements leads to more efficient and stable learning, demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Geometric properties can be leveraged to stabilize and speed reinforcement learning. Existing examples include encoding symmetry structure, geometry-aware data augmentation, and enforcing structural restrictions. In this paper, we take a novel view of RL through the lens of order theory and recast value function estimates into learning a desired poset (partially ordered set). We propose \emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. We empirically evaluate GCR-RL in a range of tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.

### [131] [Are LLMs Biased Like Humans? Causal Reasoning as a Function of Prior Knowledge, Irrelevant Information, and Reasoning Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02983)
*Hanna M. Dettki,Charley M. Wu,Bob Rehder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show more rule-like causal reasoning than humans, with different biases and greater robustness to semantic abstraction and prompt noise, suggesting they could complement human reasoning in certain contexts but may fail where uncertainty is inherent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs' causal judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching, especially as LLMs are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters.

Method: Benchmarked 20+ LLMs against human baselines on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by collider structures (C1→E←C2), using a small interpretable model to compress LLMs' judgments, and probed robustness under semantic abstraction and prompt overloading.

Result: Most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning than humans, don't mirror characteristic human collider biases (weak explaining away and Markov violations), and show greater robustness to semantic abstraction and prompt noise, especially with chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic, highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

*Haijiang Yan,Jian-Qiao Zhu,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show short-sighted planning at inference despite training capabilities; Bayesian model explains this as planning-shift driven by self-generated context accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the gap between LLMs' demonstrated sequence-level planning abilities during training and their apparently short-sighted, inconsistent planning behavior at inference time.

Method: Propose a Bayesian account grounding planning behavior in evolving generative context, validated through two controlled experiments: random-generation task showing constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength with context accumulation, and Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias with self-generated sequences.

Result: The Bayesian model explains planning-shift during inference due to accumulated self-generated context, with experiments demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts, increasing planning strength as context accumulates, and reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical explanation and empirical evidence for how LLMs plan ahead during inference, explaining the apparent gap between training capabilities and inference behavior through the lens of planning-shift driven by self-generated context accumulation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.

*Sizhe Tang,Rongqian Chen,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Alpha introduces a unified GUI agent framework using step-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with alpha-UCT guidance to enable regressive planning, early pruning, and prefix reuse, achieving state-of-the-art 77% success rate on OSWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents using trajectory-level sampling lack regressive ability, preventing reuse of partial successes and recovery from early missteps. There's a need for more sophisticated planning that can actively model and exploit the structure of the planning space.

Method: Agent Alpha combines generation, exploration, and evaluation through step-level MCTS with alpha-UCT guided search. It features comparison-driven evaluation to mitigate scoring biases, diversity-constrained expansion to maintain compact search space, and enables deliberate planning with early pruning and prefix reuse.

Result: Agent Alpha achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of ~77% on the OSWorld benchmark, significantly outperforming trajectory-level baselines under equivalent computational resources. The regret bound of alpha-UCT is also analyzed.

Conclusion: Step-level MCTS with alpha-UCT guidance provides an effective framework for GUI agents, enabling regressive planning, efficient search space management, and superior performance compared to trajectory-level approaches.

Abstract: While scaling test-time compute through trajectory-level sampling has significantly improved Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, the lack of regressive ability prevents the reuse of partial successes and the recovery from early missteps. In this paper, we introduce Agent Alpha, a unified framework that synergizes generation, exploration, and evaluation through step-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It enables active modeling or exploiting structures of the planning space. By integrating alpha-UCT guided search into the interaction loop, Agent Alpha enables deliberate planning, facilitating early pruning of suboptimal branches and efficient prefix reuse. We also employ comparison-driven evaluation to mitigate absolute scoring biases and diversity-constrained expansion to maintain a compact, informative search space. Regret bound of alpha-UCT is analyzed. On the OSWorld benchmark, Agent Alpha achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of $\sim 77\%$, significantly outperforming trajectory-level baselines under equivalent compute.

*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews differentiable social choice - a new paradigm that makes voting rules and social choice mechanisms learnable and differentiable, enabling optimization from data across various ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social choice has become foundational to modern ML systems (auctions, federated learning, LLM alignment, etc.), but these systems often implement social choice mechanisms implicitly without normative scrutiny. There's a need to make these mechanisms explicit, learnable, and optimized from data.

Method: The paper surveys and synthesizes the emerging paradigm of differentiable social choice, which formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models that can be optimized from data. It covers applications across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, and decentralized aggregation.

Result: The review shows how classical social choice axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs in differentiable frameworks. It identifies 36 open problems that define a new research agenda at the intersection of ML, economics, and democratic theory.

Conclusion: Differentiable social choice represents a significant paradigm shift that makes social choice mechanisms explicit, learnable, and optimizable in ML systems, creating new opportunities to address fundamental trade-offs between efficiency, fairness, and strategic properties while opening up a rich interdisciplinary research agenda.

Abstract: Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.
  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.

### [135] [Distilling LLM Reasoning into Graph of Concept Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03006)
*Ziyang Yu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCP is a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes LLM reasoning as a graph and trains modular concept predictors to improve sample efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active distillation methods for LLMs only distill final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of reasoning errors and missing components.

Method: Proposes Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP) that externalizes teacher's decision process as a DAG and mirrors it with modular concept predictors. Uses graph-aware acquisition strategy targeting uncertainty at critical nodes and targeted sub-module retraining that attributes downstream loss to specific predictors.

Result: Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks show GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

Conclusion: GCP provides an effective reasoning-aware active distillation framework that improves sample efficiency, interpretability, and training stability for deploying LLMs in discriminative workloads.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

*Jiliang Ni,Jiachen Pu,Zhongyi Yang,Jingfeng Luo,Conggang Hu*

TL;DR: STAR is a framework that transfers LLM capabilities to super-tiny models for efficient function calling, using constrained knowledge distillation and similarity-guided RL to overcome overfitting and training instability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are crucial for AI agents but too large for widespread adoption. Existing methods suffer from overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and difficulty synergizing techniques.

Method: STAR framework with two innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD) using top-k forward KL divergence to suppress incorrect predictions while preserving exploration, and (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL) with fine-grained similarity-based rewards for better policy optimization.

Result: STAR models achieve SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. The 0.6B STAR model achieves best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing several larger-scale models.

Conclusion: STAR demonstrates an effective training framework for distilling LLM capabilities into super-tiny models, enabling powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

### [137] [RC-GRPO: Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Tool Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025)
*Haitian Zhong,Jixiu Zhai,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Qiang Liu,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RC-GRPO improves multi-turn tool calling in LLMs by using reward-conditioned tokens to enhance exploration diversity during RL training, overcoming the problem of vanishing updates when reward variation is low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for LLMs due to sparse rewards and expensive exploration. Standard SFT+GRPO methods stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., most rollouts get all 0 or all 1 rewards), making group-normalized advantages uninformative and causing vanishing updates.

Method: Proposes RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization) which treats exploration as controllable steering via discrete reward tokens. First fine-tunes a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into prompts. During RL, samples diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and conditions rollouts on sampled tokens to improve within-group diversity.

Result: On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, the method yields consistently improved performance over baselines. Performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

Conclusion: RC-GRPO effectively addresses the exploration diversity problem in multi-turn tool calling by using reward-conditioned tokens to steer exploration, leading to better advantage estimation and improved performance compared to standard approaches.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

*Weilin Ruan,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAS4TS is a multi-agent system for time series analysis that combines visual reasoning with tool-driven execution, achieving SOTA performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series methods lack intuitive visual reasoning capabilities and struggle to generalize across different tasks with adaptive tool usage. There's a need for a unified framework that can integrate visual understanding with flexible tool selection.

Method: Proposes MAS4TS built on Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm. Uses Vision-Language Model for visual reasoning over time series plots to extract temporal structures, then reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, with a router selecting task-specific tool chains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks on a wide range of time series tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and efficient inference.

Conclusion: MAS4TS successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by integrating visual reasoning, agent coordination, and adaptive tool usage in a unified framework for general time series analysis.

Abstract: Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.

*Binbin Yong,Haoran Pei,Jun Shen,Haoran Li,Qingguo Zhou,Zhao Su*

TL;DR: KANFIS is a compact neuro-fuzzy system that uses additive function decomposition instead of product-based inference, solving exponential rule explosion in high-dimensional spaces while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ANFIS suffers from structural complexity where product-based inference causes exponential rule explosion in high-dimensional spaces, limiting scalability and interpretability.

Method: Proposes KANFIS (Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) with additive aggregation mechanism, sparse masking for compact rule sets, and compatibility with both Type-1 and Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic systems.

Result: KANFIS achieves competitive performance against neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines while scaling linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially.

Conclusion: KANFIS provides a compact, interpretable neuro-fuzzy architecture that overcomes the exponential rule explosion problem of conventional ANFIS while maintaining competitive performance and uncertainty modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to combine the learning capabilities of neural network with the reasoning transparency of fuzzy logic. However, conventional ANFIS architectures suffer from structural complexity, where the product-based inference mechanism causes an exponential explosion of rules in high-dimensional spaces. We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines.

*Vishal Venkataramani,Haizhou Shi,Zixuan Ke,Austin Xu,Xiaoxiao He,Yingbo Zhou,Semih Yavuz,Hao Wang,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Process verification for multi-agent systems built on LLMs shows inconsistent performance improvements and high variance, with LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforming reward-based approaches, but effective verification remains an open challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems using LLMs have high variance in reasoning trajectories, and while process verification has shown promise in single-agent settings, its effectiveness in multi-agent coordination remains unclear and needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Conducted MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study spanning three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, process reward models), two granularity levels (agent-level, iteration-level), five verifiers, four context management strategies, across six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and shows high variance. LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges beating general-purpose LLMs. Small performance gap exists between LLMs as judges vs. single agents, and context-length-performance trade-off identified.

Conclusion: Effective and robust process verification for multi-agent systems remains an open challenge requiring advances beyond current paradigms, despite some promising approaches like LLM-as-a-Judge.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

*Bryce Kan,Wei Yang,Emily Nguyen,Ganghui Yi,Bowen Yi,Chenxiao Yu,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JobRec is a generative job recommendation framework that separates candidate preference from employer qualification using dual-perspective reasoning and constrained optimization for controllable professional matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing job recommendation systems conflate candidate preference and employer qualification into a single interaction signal, leading to confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limited policy controllability.

Method: 1) Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate/job attributes into structured semantic layers; 2) Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy with decoupled experts for preference and qualification inference; 3) Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module for optimization under explicit eligibility requirements.

Result: JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching, with experiments using a synthetic dataset refined by experts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully de-conflates preference and qualification in job recommendation, enabling more controllable and effective professional matching through dual-perspective reasoning and constrained optimization.

Abstract: Professional job recommendation involves a complex bipartite matching process that must reconcile a candidate's subjective preference with an employer's objective qualification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for modeling the rich semantics of resumes and job descriptions, existing paradigms often collapse these two decision dimensions into a single interaction signal, yielding confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limiting policy controllability. To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Risky-Bench is a framework for systematic safety evaluation of LLM agents in real-world deployments, using domain-agnostic safety principles to create context-aware safety rubrics and assess risks during realistic task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent safety evaluations have limited coverage of safety risk space, fail to assess safety during long-horizon interactive tasks, and are too specialized to specific agent settings, limiting adaptability across diverse deployments.

Method: Organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles, derives context-aware safety rubrics to delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions.

Result: When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions.

Conclusion: Risky-Bench provides an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment that can be adapted to various deployment settings beyond life-assist scenarios, offering a well-structured evaluation pipeline for comprehensive safety evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that operate in real-world environments, introducing safety risks beyond linguistic harm. Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAFBench is a unified evaluation suite that reveals how multi-agent LLM framework architectural choices alone can cause 100x latency increases, 30% accuracy drops, and 60% coordination failure increases, leading to concrete design principles and selection guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM frameworks have significant architectural impact on system performance (latency, throughput, accuracy, scalability) but this impact is poorly understood. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation to isolate architectural effects.

Method: Introduced an architectural taxonomy for systematic comparison of multi-agent LLM frameworks, and developed MAFBench - a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline for controlled empirical study across widely used frameworks.

Result: Framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%.

Conclusion: The study translates findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outlines promising future research directions for multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.

### [144] [General Agents Contain World Models, even under Partial Observability and Stochasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03146)
*Santiago Cifuentes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends previous work showing optimal agents must contain world models to stochastic agents in partially observable environments, proving randomization doesn't avoid learning environment models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed deterministic agents in fully observable environments must contain world models, but real-world agents are often stochastic and operate in partially observable settings. The paper aims to extend these theoretical foundations to more realistic scenarios.

Method: Extends the theoretical framework from previous work to handle stochastic agents and partially observable environments. Weakened the notion of "generality" to show even less powerful agents contain world models.

Result: Proved that stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments cannot avoid learning their environment through randomization. Strengthened the result by showing weaker agents already contain world models.

Conclusion: The fundamental result that optimal agents must contain world models extends to more realistic settings with stochasticity and partial observability, showing randomization doesn't circumvent the need to learn environment models.

Abstract: Deciding whether an agent possesses a model of its surrounding world is a fundamental step toward understanding its capabilities and limitations. In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.
  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.

*Wei Dai,Haoyu Wang,Honghao Chang,Lijun He,Fan Li,Jian Sun,Haixia Bi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diffusion-based restoration strategy for VLMs that handles missing modalities via dynamic gating and cross-modal learning, outperforming existing methods in zero-shot evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle when modalities are incomplete, with prompt methods failing to restore essential features and imputation methods generating irrelevant noise. There's a need for precise semantic restoration while maintaining VLM generalization.

Method: Proposes a pluggable diffusion model module with: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating to adaptively use conditional features for semantically consistent generation, and (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning to align semantic spaces between dual encoders bidirectionally.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets. Shows robustness across diverse missing rates and environments, confirming it as a scalable extension for VLMs.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general missing modality restoration strategy that maintains VLM reliability while effectively handling incomplete modality inputs through diffusion-based feature restoration.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.

TL;DR: VALUEFLOW: A unified framework for hierarchical value extraction, intensity evaluation, and calibrated steering of LLMs across multiple value theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods fail to capture hierarchical value structures and calibrated intensity control. Preference-based methods miss deeper motivational principles, while value-based approaches lack proper intensity measurement and steerability understanding.

Method: VALUEFLOW framework with three components: 1) HIVES - hierarchical value embedding space capturing intra- and cross-theory structure; 2) VIDB - large-scale value-labeled text database with intensity estimates from ranking-based aggregation; 3) Anchor-based evaluator producing consistent intensity scores by ranking outputs against VIDB panels.

Result: Comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories reveals asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. Establishes scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity.

Conclusion: VALUEFLOW advances pluralistic alignment of LLMs by providing a unified framework for extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control, addressing key gaps in current value-based alignment approaches.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

TL;DR: TDScaling is a trajectory diversity scaling framework for code agents that improves performance through diversity rather than raw data volume, addressing limitations of quantity-centric scaling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code LLM agents face generalization limits due to low-quality synthetic data and diminishing returns from quantity scaling. Quantity-centric approaches have early bottlenecks and underutilize trajectory data.

Method: TDScaling integrates four innovations: 1) Business Cluster mechanism for real-service logical dependencies, 2) blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm for trajectory coherence, 3) adaptive evolution mechanism using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse, and 4) sandboxed code tool to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) show TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency, achieving win-win outcomes.

Conclusion: TDScaling demonstrates that scaling performance through diversity rather than raw volume yields better performance-cost trade-offs for agent training, with plans to release codebase and synthesized dataset (30,000+ tool clusters).

Abstract: As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.

TL;DR: TAME framework uses dual-memory evolution to maintain agent trustworthiness during test-time memory evolution, preventing safety degradation while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agent safety alignment remains vulnerable during benign task evolution (Agent Memory Misevolution), causing trustworthiness decline even when tasks evolve normally.

Method: TAME: Dual-memory evolutionary framework with separate executor memory (improves task performance via methodology distillation) and evaluator memory (refines safety and utility assessments using historical feedback). Uses closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating.

Result: TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance. Trust-Memevo benchmark reveals overall trustworthiness decline across various task domains and evaluation settings.

Conclusion: TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility during agent memory evolution, addressing the critical safety vulnerability in AGI development through test-time experience accumulation.

Abstract: Test-time evolution of agent memory serves as a pivotal paradigm for achieving AGI by bolstering complex reasoning through experience accumulation. However, even during benign task evolution, agent safety alignment remains vulnerable-a phenomenon known as Agent Memory Misevolution. To evaluate this phenomenon, we construct the Trust-Memevo benchmark to assess multi-dimensional trustworthiness during benign task evolution, revealing an overall decline in trustworthiness across various task domains and evaluation settings. To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility. Experiments demonstrate that TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving a joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluation benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations use fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks with varying prompt engineering, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to models themselves. Lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results, introducing unfairness and opacity into the field.

Method: The paper introduces a proposal for standardizing agent evaluation through a unified evaluation framework, though specific methodological details are not provided in the abstract.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual proposal rather than empirical results, advocating for standardization as essential for rigorous advancement of agent evaluation.

Conclusion: A unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation, and the paper introduces a proposal aimed at achieving this standardization to address current challenges in fairness, reproducibility, and attribution of performance gains.

Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.

Method: Introduces Accordion-Thinking framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate reasoning granularity through dynamic summarization. Uses reinforcement learning to incentivize periodic thought summarization and historical token discarding in "Fold" inference mode.

Result: Achieves 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on 48GB GPU memory configuration. The accuracy gap between efficient Fold mode and exhaustive Unfold mode vanishes during training, showing models learn to encode essential reasoning into compact summaries.

Conclusion: LLMs can learn effective self-compression of reasoning context, enabling complex reasoning with minimal token overhead while maintaining solution quality and providing human-readable reasoning summaries.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.

### [151] [LPS-Bench: Benchmarking Safety Awareness of Computer-Use Agents in Long-Horizon Planning under Benign and Adversarial Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03255)
*Tianyu Chen,Chujia Hu,Ge Gao,Dongrui Liu,Xia Hu,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LPS-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating planning-time safety awareness of computer-use agents in long-horizon tasks, revealing significant safety deficiencies in existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for computer-use agents focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks and only evaluate execution-time errors, overlooking the critical need to assess planning-time safety awareness against ambiguous instructions and adversarial manipulation.

Method: Created LPS-Bench with 65 scenarios across 7 task domains and 9 risk types, using a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through planning trajectories.

Result: Experiments revealed substantial deficiencies in existing computer-use agents' ability to maintain safe behavior during long-horizon planning, demonstrating the need for improved safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper presents LPS-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for planning-time safety evaluation, analyzes identified risks, proposes mitigation strategies, and opens the code to advance safety in MCP-based computer-use agent systems.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) that interact with real computer systems can perform automated tasks but face critical safety risks. Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior. We further analyze the risks and propose mitigation strategies to improve long-horizon planning safety in MCP-based CUA systems. We open-source our code at https://github.com/tychenn/LPS-Bench.

*Yuxuan Liu,Yuntian Shi,Kun Wang,Haoting Shen,Kun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability in multimodal LLMs, testing safety, over-rejection, bias, and hallucination through 61 fine-grained types with paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs' safety behavior may be driven by unimodal shortcuts rather than true joint intent understanding, creating a need for systematic evaluation of cross-modal reliability.

Method: Introduces CSR-Bench with four stress-testing interaction patterns (Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, Hallucination) covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance requires integrated image-text interpretation, with paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. Evaluates 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: Models show systematic cross-modal alignment gaps: weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only to multimodal inputs. Also reveals trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior.

Conclusion: Some apparent safety gains in MLLMs may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding, highlighting the need for better cross-modal reliability evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

*Zhengbo Jiao,Shaobo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Xuan Ren,Wei Wang,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Proposing framework uses specialized agents to generate high-quality synthetic reasoning problems through iterative skill composition, enabling efficient training of LLMs with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality verifiable datasets for complex reasoning are expensive and difficult to scale through human annotation. Current synthesis methods face trade-offs between structural validity and problem complexity, often producing inconsistent or unsolvable instances.

Method: Agentic Proposing models problem synthesis as goal-driven sequential decision process where specialized agents dynamically select and compose modular reasoning skills. Uses iterative workflow with internal reflection and tool-use, trained with Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate verifiable training trajectories.

Result: Downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines with robust cross-domain generalization. A 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models like GPT-5.

Conclusion: Small volumes of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets, demonstrating that agent-driven synthesis enables efficient scaling of complex reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.

*Yuelin Hu,Jun Xu,Bingcong Lu,Zhengxue Cheng,Hongwei Hu,Ronghua Wu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MeetBench XL introduces a realistic enterprise meeting benchmark and MeetMaster XL agent framework for handling complex meeting queries with dual-policy routing between fast/slow reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meeting benchmarks are too simplistic and don't reflect real enterprise workflows where queries arise organically from multi-stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool-augmented reasoning under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints.

Method: 1) Created MeetAll dataset from 231 enterprise meetings (140 hours) with questions injected using enterprise-informed protocol; 2) Developed MeetBench XL multi-dimensional evaluation protocol; 3) Built MeetMaster XL dual-policy agent that optimizes query routing between fast/slow reasoning paths and tool invocation.

Result: The approach shows consistent gains over commercial systems, with a lightweight classifier enabling accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving superior quality-latency tradeoff over single model baselines.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in enterprise meeting AI assistants by providing a grounded dataset, evaluation protocol, and learned agent framework that handles diverse operational tasks under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Enterprise meeting environments require AI assistants that handle diverse operational tasks, from rapid fact checking during live discussions to cross meeting analysis for strategic planning, under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints. Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.
  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.
  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench.

### [155] [Rejecting Arguments Based on Doubt in Structured Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03286)
*Michael A. Müller,Srdjan Vesic,Bruno Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new computational argumentation approach incorporating philosophical ideas: agents can reject arguments based on doubt, and focus on acceptable sentences rather than just arguments. Introduces structured bipolar argumentation frameworks with novel semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two overlooked philosophical/linguistic ideas in computational argumentation: 1) agents can rationally reject arguments based on mere doubt (not all defended arguments must be accepted), and 2) it's sometimes more natural to think about acceptable sentences/claims rather than arguments.

Method: Define structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs) where arguments consist of sentences with attack and support relations. Provide new semantics that don't force acceptance of all defended arguments (unlike completeness-based semantics) and include both argument extensions and language extensions.

Result: Develop semantics that lie between admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. The approach provides new perspectives on existing methods: specifies conditions for ignoring support between arguments (when abstract argumentation is warranted) and shows deductive support semantics is a special case.

Conclusion: The paper presents a philosophically-informed computational argumentation approach that better models rational agent behavior by allowing doubt-based rejection and sentence-level reasoning, bridging gaps between abstract argumentation and structured approaches.

Abstract: This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.

*Menglin Xia,Xuchao Zhang,Shantanu Dixit,Paramaguru Harimurugan,Rujia Wang,Victor Ruhle,Robert Sim,Chetan Bansal,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memora is a harmonic memory representation system that balances abstraction and specificity for AI agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on memory benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent memory systems struggle to scale efficiently while maintaining both abstraction (for scalability) and specificity (for detailed reasoning). Abstraction often sacrifices fine-grained details needed for effective reasoning.

Method: Memora uses primary abstractions to index concrete memory values and consolidate updates, with cue anchors for cross-aspect retrieval. It employs an active retrieval policy that exploits memory connections beyond direct semantic similarity.

Result: Memora establishes new state-of-the-art on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.

Conclusion: Memora provides a theoretically grounded framework that generalizes standard RAG and KG-based systems, offering a practical solution for scalable agent memory that maintains both abstraction and specificity.

Abstract: Agent memory systems must accommodate continuously growing information while supporting efficient, context-aware retrieval for downstream tasks. Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.

*Xiao Sun,Yuming Yang,Junnan Zhu,Jiang Zhong,Xinyu Zhou,Kaiwen Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MentalDx Bench is the first benchmark for disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis using real clinical data, revealing LLMs' failure at fine-grained diagnosis despite good coarse categorization. MentalSeek-Dx, a 14B parameter medical-specialized LLM with clinical reasoning training, achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks for psychiatric assessment lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision, limiting their clinical utility. There's a need for benchmarks that reflect real-world clinical settings and disorder-level diagnosis.

Method: 1) Created MentalDx Bench: 712 de-identified EHRs annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, covering 76 disorders across 16 categories. 2) Developed MentalSeek-Dx: Medical-specialized LLM trained through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning to internalize clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 18 LLMs revealed paradigm misalignment - strong coarse diagnostic categorization but systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis. MentalSeek-Dx achieved state-of-the-art performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between pattern-based LLM modeling and clinical reasoning, demonstrating that specialized training in clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning enables reliable psychiatric diagnosis at disorder-level granularity.

Abstract: Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

Conclusion: Transformer models can effectively learn moral reasoning patterns from trolley dilemmas, and interpretability techniques reveal how moral biases are computationally implemented across different network stages.

Abstract: We build a custom transformer model to study how neural networks make moral decisions on trolley-style dilemmas. The model processes structured scenarios using embeddings that encode who is affected, how many people, and which outcome they belong to.

We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFlowPO: A probabilistic prompt optimization framework using GFlowNets and dynamic memory updates for sample-efficient prompt search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt optimization for language models is challenging due to the combinatorially large search space and sparse rewards from expensive LM evaluations. Existing RL-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency due to on-policy updates and fixed meta-prompt distributions.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with off-policy GFlowNet objective using replay-based training for sample efficiency; 2) Dynamic Memory Update (DMU) that updates the meta-prompt by injecting diverse prompts from replay buffer and top-performing prompts from a priority queue.

Result: GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks.

Conclusion: GFlowPO provides an effective probabilistic framework for prompt optimization that addresses sample efficiency issues through off-policy learning and dynamic meta-prompt updates, demonstrating superior performance across multiple NLP tasks.

Abstract: Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

*Mengxuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Gang Xu,Tao He,Hongjie Jiang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAI is a lightweight, training-free safety framework that enhances VLMs' risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals through targeted modulation of high-risk visual tokens, reducing jailbreak attacks without degrading utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks, existing defenses are costly (safety fine-tuning) or degrade utility (aggressive token manipulation), and visual inputs in VLMs often dilute risk signals that LLMs naturally recognize.

Method: Risk Awareness Injection (RAI) constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens to explicitly activate safety-critical signals in the cross-modal feature space.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks show RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

Conclusion: RAI provides an effective, lightweight, training-free safety calibration framework that restores LLM-like risk recognition in VLMs while preserving cross-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CRL-VLA is a framework for continual reinforcement learning of Vision-Language-Action models that balances stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) through asymmetric regulation and a dual-critic architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifelong learning is essential for embodied agents in open-world environments, but existing methods struggle with the stability-plasticity trade-off when fine-tuning VLA models for continual reinforcement learning scenarios.

Method: CRL-VLA uses asymmetric regulation to constrain advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks, implemented through a dual-critic architecture with Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF) where a frozen critic maintains semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show CRL-VLA outperforms baselines in both anti-forgetting (stability) and forward adaptation (plasticity), effectively harmonizing the conflicting objectives.

Conclusion: CRL-VLA provides a theoretically grounded framework for continual post-training of VLA models that successfully addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in lifelong robotic scenarios.

Abstract: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

*Guangming Lang,Mingchuan Shang,Mengjun Hu,Jie Zhou,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict analysis to capture agent attitudes with finer granularity than classical qualitative models, enabling three-way conflict analysis with adjustment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference-based conflict models use only three qualitative relations (preference, converse, indifference) which significantly limits their capacity to capture the essence of conflict. Need finer granularity to better model agents' attitudes towards issue pairs.

Method: Introduces intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situations to capture attitudes with finer granularity. Develops intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures, constructs three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting agent pairs, agents, and issues. Uses relative loss functions to calculate thresholds, and presents adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies accounting for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees.

Result: Develops a comprehensive framework for intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict analysis with three-way decision models, threshold calculation methods, and adjustment strategies with an illustrative example demonstrating validity and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict analysis model overcomes limitations of classical qualitative models by providing finer granularity in capturing agent attitudes, enabling more nuanced conflict analysis and practical adjustment strategies.

Abstract: In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.

TL;DR: DiscoverLLM trains LLMs to help users discover their intents through interactive exploration, using a novel user simulator with hierarchical intent modeling and concretization-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with ambiguous requests because users often haven't formed clear intents yet - they need to explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking clarification questions fails when users themselves don't know their preferences.

Method: Introduces DiscoverLLM framework with a novel user simulator that models cognitive state using a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as relevant options are surfaced. Uses degree of concretization as reward signal to train models to optimize for intent discovery.

Result: Achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40% across interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing. In user study with 75 participants, improves conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DiscoverLLM enables LLMs to effectively help users form and discover their intents through adaptive exploration-convergence strategies, representing a significant advance in human-AI collaboration for ambiguous tasks.

Abstract: To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Motivation: To reduce manual schema and prompt engineering by embedding formal knowledge into generative systems, enabling structured interaction between LLMs, symbolic constraints, and external resources.

Method: Ontology-to-tools compilation within The World Avatar framework, where ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use. Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agent-based workflow to translate ontologies into ontology-aware tools for extracting, validating, and repairing structured knowledge from unstructured text.

Result: Demonstrated with metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature case study, showing how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behavior and reduce manual engineering efforts.

Conclusion: Establishes a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems through ontology-to-tools compilation, enabling semantic constraint enforcement during generation rather than through post-hoc validation.

Abstract: We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.

*Zeynep G. Saribatur,Johannes Langer,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Formal abstractions (removal and clustering) in symbolic AI explanations improve human understanding and reduce cognitive effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand, and while symbolic AI offers transparency, raw logical traces impose high cognitive load on users.

Method: Used Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework to define irrelevant details for abstraction, then conducted cognitive experiments where participants classified stimuli with explanations derived from answer set programs.

Result: Clustering details significantly improved participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduced cognitive effort, supporting that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.

Conclusion: Formal abstractions (specifically removal and clustering) effectively enhance human-centered symbolic explanations by improving understanding and reducing cognitive effort.

Abstract: Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.

*Haohao Luo,Zexi Li,Yuexiang Xie,Wenhao Zhang,Yaliang Li,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentRL trains proactive agents to clarify user intents before starting computationally expensive deep research, improving outcomes through scalable data generation and two-stage reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Research (DR) agents face an autonomy-interaction dilemma: they're computationally expensive and time-consuming, often producing unsatisfactory outcomes when given ambiguous user queries due to prolonged execution without clarification.

Method: Proposed IntentRL framework with: 1) scalable pipeline to expand seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph; 2) two-stage RL: Stage I learns general user-interaction behavior on offline dialogues, Stage II uses trained agent and user simulator for online rollouts to adapt to diverse feedback.

Result: IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

Conclusion: IntentRL effectively addresses the autonomy-interaction dilemma in Deep Research agents by enabling proactive intent clarification before resource-intensive research, leading to better outcomes through improved intent understanding and adaptation.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

*Guannan Lai,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EquiRouter addresses routing collapse in LLM routing by directly learning model rankings instead of scalar performance scores, reducing costs by ~17% while maintaining GPT-4-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routers suffer from routing collapse - they systematically default to the most expensive models even when cheaper models suffice, wasting computation and monetary costs. This undermines the core promise of routing which aims to achieve optimal quality-cost trade-offs.

Method: EquiRouter addresses the objective-decision mismatch by directly learning model rankings rather than predicting scalar performance scores. This decision-aware approach prevents small prediction errors from flipping relative orderings and triggering suboptimal model selections.

Result: On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. It restores the role of smaller models and mitigates routing collapse across both unimodal and multimodal settings.

Conclusion: Directly learning model rankings instead of scalar scores effectively addresses routing collapse in LLM routing, enabling better utilization of smaller models and achieving superior quality-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.

### [168] [Group Selection as a Safeguard Against AI Substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03541)
*Qiankun Zhong,Thomas F. Eisenmann,Julian Garcia,Iyad Rahwan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI use can reduce cultural diversity, potentially causing "cultural collapse" where AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation. AI-substitute users (relying heavily on AI) spread under individual selection despite harming cultural variance, while AI-complement users (using AI as guidance) can benefit groups and be favored by cultural group selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses concerns that reliance on generative AI reduces cultural variance and diversity in creative work, which has already led to problems like model collapse and hallucination. The authors want to examine long-term consequences for human cultural evolution and identify conditions under which widespread AI use could lead to "cultural collapse" - a reduction in human variation and innovation that slows cumulative cultural evolution.

Method: The researchers use an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory to compare two types of AI use: complement (users seek suggestions but remain main producers) and substitute (users provide minimal input, rely on AI for most output). They study how these strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics, examining both individual-level and group-level selection pressures.

Result: AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite causing stronger reduction in cultural variance. AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. This creates a tension between individual incentives and group-level benefits.

Conclusion: The findings reveal potential long-term risks of AI adoption for cultural evolution, highlighting how individual incentives may favor AI-substitute use that reduces cultural diversity, while group-level selection could favor AI-complement approaches. This informs policy and organizational strategies to mitigate risks of cultural collapse by considering both individual and group-level dynamics in AI adoption.

Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.

*Davide Paglieri,Logan Cross,William A. Cunningham,Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Persona Generators use evolutionary optimization with LLMs to create diverse synthetic populations that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences, outperforming existing methods on diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI systems requires understanding behavior across diverse human populations, but collecting representative data is expensive/infeasible, especially for novel technologies or future scenarios. Existing methods need detailed population data and focus on density matching rather than support coverage, leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored.

Method: Introduce Persona Generators - functions that produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. Apply iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using LLMs as mutation operators to refine Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. Optimization produces lightweight generators that expand small descriptions into diverse synthetic personas maximizing coverage of opinions/preferences along relevant diversity axes.

Result: Evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts. They produce populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Persona Generators provide an effective method for creating diverse synthetic populations that maximize coverage rather than just density matching, enabling better evaluation of AI systems across diverse human populations without expensive data collection.

Abstract: Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

TL;DR: EHRWorld: A patient-centric medical world model trained on longitudinal EHR data that outperforms naive LLM baselines for simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with maintaining consistent patient states under sequential interventions in medical simulations, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical scenarios. There's a need for reliable medical world models that can simulate disease progression and treatment outcomes over time.

Method: Introduces EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, along with EHRWorld-110K - a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records.

Result: EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: Training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data is necessary for reliable and robust medical world modeling, as naive LLMs with only medical knowledge struggle with consistent state maintenance in sequential interventions.

Abstract: World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show improved strategic planning for complex astrodynamics problems but fail at practical implementation due to technical execution errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current LLMs can handle autonomous multi-stage planning in complex, physically constrained environments like space mission design, using the GTOC 12 asteroid mining competition as a benchmark.

Method: Adapted MLE-Bench framework to orbital mechanics, deployed AIDE-based agent architecture for autonomous mission solution generation, and used "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology with expert-developed rubrics to evaluate strategic viability across five categories.

Result: Strategic viability scores nearly doubled in two years (9.3 to 17.2/26), showing improved conceptual understanding, but models consistently failed at implementation due to unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have sufficient knowledge for space science tasks but face an implementation barrier, functioning as domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers due to execution failures despite strategic competence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

TL;DR: Search-R2: Actor-Refiner framework with fine-grained rewards for training search-integrated reasoning agents, outperforming RAG and RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training search-integrated reasoning agents via RL suffers from multi-scale credit assignment problem - sparse trajectory-level rewards fail to distinguish high-quality reasoning from lucky guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors.

Method: Proposes Search-R2: Actor-Refiner collaboration framework with Actor producing initial reasoning trajectories and Meta-Refiner selectively diagnosing/repairing flawed steps via 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. Uses hybrid reward design coupling outcome correctness with dense process reward quantifying information density of retrieved evidence.

Result: Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets show Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Search-R2 effectively addresses the multi-scale credit assignment problem in training search-integrated reasoning agents through targeted intervention and fine-grained supervision, enabling more efficient and accurate reasoning.

Abstract: Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

### [173] [Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664)
*Yang Wan,Zheng Cao,Zhenhao Zhang,Zhengwen Zeng,Shuheng Shen,Changhua Meng,Linchao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs in multi-turn agent scenarios suffer from "conversational inertia" where they imitate their own previous responses, limiting exploration. The paper proposes Context Preference Learning to calibrate models to favor low-inertia responses and provides inference-time context management strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel as few-shot learners, this strength becomes problematic in multi-turn agent scenarios where they erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples, creating "conversational inertia" that constrains exploration and creates a tension between context length benefits and imitation bias.

Method: Through attention analysis identifying conversational inertia, the authors propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over high-inertia ones. They also provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that the framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

Conclusion: The paper identifies conversational inertia as a key challenge in transforming few-shot LLMs into agents and provides both training (Context Preference Learning) and inference (context management) solutions to balance exploration and exploitation in multi-turn scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

TL;DR: TodyComm is a task-oriented dynamic communication algorithm for multi-agent LLM systems that adapts communication topologies across rounds based on changing agent roles, adversaries, and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM systems use fixed communication topologies during inference, which fails in realistic applications where agent roles change across rounds due to dynamic adversaries, task progression, or time-varying constraints like communication bandwidth.

Method: TodyComm produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to dynamics at each round, optimizing task utility through policy gradient methods.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness under both dynamic adversary and communication budget constraints while maintaining token efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Dynamic communication topologies that adapt to changing agent roles and constraints are essential for effective multi-agent LLM collaboration in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: AOrchestra introduces a unified agent abstraction (Instruction, Context, Tools, Model) that enables dynamic creation of specialized executors for complex tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language agent systems lack dynamic abstraction views of sub-agents, which limits their adaptability for complex, long-horizon tasks. The sub-agent-as-tools paradigm needs better abstraction mechanisms to improve flexibility and reduce human engineering efforts.

Method: Proposes a framework-agnostic agent abstraction as a tuple (Instruction, Context, Tools, Model). AOrchestra system uses a central orchestrator that concretizes this tuple at each step: curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation.

Result: Achieves 16.28% relative improvement against strongest baselines when paired with Gemini-3-Flash across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench). Enables controllable performance-cost trade-off approaching Pareto-efficiency.

Conclusion: The unified agent abstraction enables dynamic, on-demand agent creation for complex tasks, reducing engineering effort while maintaining framework-agnostic flexibility and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

TL;DR: Scaling LLM-based multi-agent systems with homogeneous agents shows diminishing returns, while heterogeneous agents (different models/prompts/tools) provide substantial gains due to complementary evidence and effective channel diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems are promising for complex tasks, but scaling with homogeneous agents shows diminishing returns. Understanding why diversity helps and what limits scaling is crucial for building efficient systems.

Method: Developed information-theoretic framework showing MAS performance is bounded by task uncertainty, not agent count. Introduced K* metric to quantify effective channels without ground-truth labels. Analyzed homogeneous vs. heterogeneous agent configurations.

Result: Heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed 16 homogeneous agents. Diversity enables accessing more effective channels for complementary evidence.

Conclusion: Performance scaling is limited by task uncertainty, not agent count. Diversity-aware design is essential for efficient and robust multi-agent systems, with heterogeneous agents providing substantial gains through complementary evidence.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

TL;DR: Risk-controlled adaptive reasoning for LLMs: A framework that uses upper and lower thresholds to stop reasoning when confident or unsolvable, minimizing compute while maintaining target error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable test-time scaling where accuracy improves with more tokens, but setting token budgets and thresholds involves a practical risk-accuracy trade-off challenge. Current approaches lack systematic risk control while minimizing computational costs.

Method: Proposes a risk control framework with two thresholds: (1) upper threshold stops reasoning when model is confident (risking incorrect output), and (2) novel parametric lower threshold preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Uses distribution-free risk control to optimally specify stopping mechanisms given target risk and validation set. Incorporates efficiency loss for scenarios with multiple budget criteria to select most computationally efficient exiting mechanism.

Result: Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to user-specified risk targets.

Conclusion: The risk control approach effectively balances computational efficiency with reliability, providing a systematic method for adaptive reasoning in LLMs that respects user-specified risk constraints while minimizing compute.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.

Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

*Xi Chen,Homa Esfahanizadeh,Foad Sohrabi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework using vector quantized variational autoencoder with information-theoretic regularization for efficient fixed-length compression in massive MIMO systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance CSI feedback overhead with achievable downlink rate in massive MIMO systems, maximizing utility of limited feedback while maintaining high system performance.

Method: Vector quantized variational autoencoder framework with information-theoretic regularization using differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator to promote effective codebook utilization under fixed feedback budget.

Result: Achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes while using fixed-length feedback; learned codewords show more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures correlated with underlying CSI.

Conclusion: The proposed precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework effectively balances compression efficiency and system performance through information-theoretic regularization, enabling fixed-length feedback with performance matching variable-length schemes.

Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote vision sensors for autonomous systems face challenges transmitting high-volume visual data over resource-constrained channels in real-time, especially in robotics/control applications where systems can destabilize quickly requiring higher sampling frequencies.

Conclusion: Optically passive vision compression using event cameras with optical preprocessing offers superior compression performance for real-time visual data transmission in resource-constrained autonomous systems.

Abstract: The use of remote vision sensors for autonomous decision-making poses the challenge of transmitting high-volume visual data over resource-constrained channels in real-time. In robotics and control applications, many systems can quickly destabilize, which can exacerbate the issue by necessitating higher sampling frequencies. This work proposes a novel sensing paradigm in which an event camera observes the optically generated cosine transform of a visual scene, enabling high-speed, computation-free video compression inspired by modern video codecs. In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases.

*Xi Zhong,Jörg Kliewer,Mingyue Ji*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Extends coded polynomial aggregation to straggler-aware systems, establishing necessary/sufficient conditions for exact recovery based on intersection structure of non-straggler patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coded polynomial aggregation schemes only work in idealized settings without stragglers, but real distributed systems need to handle straggler nodes. The paper aims to extend CPA to practical straggler-aware systems.

Method: Extends CPA to systems with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, analyzes feasibility through intersection structure of admissible non-straggler sets, establishes intersection-size threshold for exact recovery, and provides explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes.

Result: Shows exact recovery is achievable with fewer worker responses than polynomial codes with individual decoding, establishes necessary/sufficient conditions for exact recovery, identifies intersection-size threshold sufficient for exact recovery, and shows threshold is necessary in generic sense when many admissible sets exist.

Conclusion: Successfully extends CPA to straggler-aware systems, provides theoretical characterization of feasibility based on intersection structure, demonstrates practical feasibility through explicit constructions and simulations showing sharp transition at predicted threshold.

Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) in distributed computing systems enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial computations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.

*Hadi Aghaee,Christian Deppe,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Perfect oblivious transfer is impossible over noisy channels with non-signaling correlations, and even negligible leakage cannot be achieved asymptotically due to message distinguishability amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations.

Method: Model the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box to obtain a unified perspective on both channel behavior and resulting correlations. Analyze the asymptotic regime to study repeated use effects.

Result: Perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, even negligible leakage cannot be achieved because repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages not intended for them.

Conclusion: While perfect oblivious transfer and negligible leakage are impossible due to message distinguishability amplification, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to universal impossibility limitations, suggesting asymmetric privacy properties in such settings.

Abstract: This work investigates the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when the parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations. By modeling the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box, we obtain a unified perspective on both the channel behavior and the resulting correlations. Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation.

*Saeed R. Khosravirad,Ahmed Alkhateeb,Ingrid van de Voorde*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Optimal decoding for lossy compression with distribution mismatch: generative decompression outperforms conventional centroid rule by applying Bayesian correction at decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses practical scenarios where encoder uses mismatched distribution assumptions while decoder has access to true distribution or side information, common in standardized communication systems.

Method: Proposes generative decompression: optimal reconstruction rule using conditional expectation under true distribution given quantization indices. Extends to noisy channels with soft-decoding rules and generalizes to task-oriented decoding with MAP detection.

Result: Generative decompression closes vast majority of performance gap to ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive high-fidelity reconstruction without encoder modifications.

Conclusion: Decoder-side Bayesian correction strategies significantly outperform conventional approaches under distribution mismatch, offering practical solutions for standardized systems where encoders are fixed.

Abstract: This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper studies Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (DPIC) with heterogeneous side-information cardinalities, proposing a secure transmission scheme that ensures each client receives exactly T messages while preventing any client from acquiring more than T messages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DPIC works assume homogeneous settings with identical side-information cardinality and single message demands, which limits real-world applicability where clients typically possess unequal amounts of prior information. There's a need to address heterogeneity in distributed systems.

Method: Proposes a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring each client achieves a common target level T. Imposes a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than T messages.

Result: Analyzes the communication cost incurred by the proposed scheme under the security constraint that guarantees each client ends up with exactly T messages.

Conclusion: The work addresses the practical challenge of heterogeneous side-information in DPIC while introducing security constraints to prevent clients from acquiring more information than intended, analyzing the resulting communication costs.

Abstract: Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (DPIC) problem addresses efficient information exchange in distributed systems where clients communicate among themselves without a central server. An important consideration in DPIC is the heterogeneity of side-information and demand sizes. Although many prior works assume homogeneous settings with identical side-information cardinality and single message demands, these assumptions limit real-world applicability where clients typically possess unequal amounts of prior information. In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages. We analyze the communication cost incurred by the proposed scheme under this security constraint.

Motivation: IoT growth demands spectrally efficient and energy-frugal communication. BackCom offers low power but suffers spectral efficiency decline in dense deployments.

Result: Achieves up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power, 68% than no-sleep baselines, and 127% EE gains over OMA; identifies two operating modes based on power availability and propagation conditions.

Conclusion: NOMA-enabled BackCom establishes scalable, energy-efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments by adapting time allocation and optimizing resource usage.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices demands communication systems that are both spectrally efficient and energy frugal. Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an attractive low-power paradigm, but its spectral efficiency declines in dense deployments. This paper presents an uplink BackCom design that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and maximizes system energy efficiency (EE). In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA). These results establish NOMA-enabled BackCom as a scalable, energy efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods need high-resolution ground truth which is often unavailable in practice, so an unsupervised approach is needed.

Method: 1) Decompose hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundance maps via unmixing. 2) Train neural network to super-resolve abundance maps using synthetic data from dead leaves model. 3) Reconstruct super-resolution image by recombining super-resolved abundances with endmembers.

Result: Experimental results show effectiveness of the method and demonstrate relevance of synthetic data for training.

Conclusion: Proposed unsupervised approach using synthetic abundance data is effective for hyperspectral super-resolution when high-resolution ground truth is unavailable.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving the rich spectral information of hyperspectral images. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with high-resolution ground truth data, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on synthetic abundance data. The hyperspectral image is first decomposed into endmembers and abundance maps through hyperspectral unmixing. A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances. The final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by recombining the super-resolved abundance maps with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the relevance of synthetic data for training.

Conclusion: Latent prediction is established as a superior paradigm for ultrasound foundation models, with EchoJEPA demonstrating robust performance, sample efficiency, and strong generalization capabilities across different patient populations.

Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography promise to reduce annotation burden and improve diagnostic consistency by learning generalizable representations from large unlabeled video archives. However, current approaches fail to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts that dominate ultrasound imagery. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model for echocardiography trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. We also introduce a novel multi-view probing framework with factorized stream embeddings that standardizes evaluation under frozen backbones. Compared to prior methods, EchoJEPA reduces left ventricular ejection fraction estimation error by 19% and achieves 87.4% view classification accuracy. EchoJEPA exhibits strong sample efficiency, reaching 78.6% accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42.1% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Under acoustic perturbations, EchoJEPA degrades by only 2.3% compared to 16.8% for the next best model, and transfers zero-shot to pediatric patients with 15% lower error than the next best model, outperforming all fine-tuned baselines. These results establish latent prediction as a superior paradigm for ultrasound foundation models.

Abstract: Training deep learning models for corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is limited by the availability of large, well-annotated datasets. We present a configurable Monte Carlo simulation framework that generates synthetic corneal B-scan optical OCT images with pixel-level five-layer segmentation labels derived directly from the simulation geometry. A five-layer corneal model with Gaussian surfaces captures curvature and thickness variability in healthy and keratoconic eyes.

This approach produces over 10,000 high-resolution (1024x1024) image-label pairs and supports customization of geometry, photon count, noise, and system parameters. The resulting dataset enables systematic training, validation, and benchmarking of AI models under controlled, ground-truth conditions, providing a reproducible and scalable resource to support the development of diagnostic and surgical guidance applications in image-guided ophthalmology.

TL;DR: A framework for wide-field microscopic mosaicking that handles both linear and sinusoidal galvanometric scanning, addressing geometric and brightness inconsistencies through calibrated parameters and seam-aware processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional galvanometric scanning, especially under sinusoidal driving, causes nonuniform spatial sampling leading to geometric inconsistencies and brightness variations, which degrade image quality in wide-field microscopy.

Method: Combines translation-based geometric mosaicking model with ROI-based brightness correction and seam-aware feathering, using calibrated scan parameters and synchronized scan-camera control without image-content-based registration.

Result: Successfully reconstructed wide-field mosaicked images up to 2.5×2.5 cm² with ~6s acquisition time, achieving improved brightness uniformity, increased CNR, reduced seam artifacts, while maintaining 7.81μm lateral resolution.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and efficient solution for scan-based wide-field microscopic mosaicking that works with both linear and sinusoidal scanning strategies.

Abstract: Wide-field high-resolution microscopy requires fast scanning and accurate image mosaicking to cover large fields of view without compromising image quality. However, conventional galvanometric scanning, particularly under sinusoidal driving, can introduce nonuniform spatial sampling, leading to geometric inconsistencies and brightness variations across the scanned field. To address these challenges, we present an image mosaicking framework for wide-field microscopic imaging that is applicable to both linear and sinusoidal galvanometric scanning strategies. The proposed approach combines a translation-based geometric mosaicking model with region-of-interest (ROI) based brightness correction and seam-aware feathering to improve radiometric consistency across large fields of view. The method relies on calibrated scan parameters and synchronized scan--camera control, without requiring image-content-based registration. Using the proposed framework, wide-field mosaicked images were successfully reconstructed under both linear and sinusoidal scanning strategies, achieving a field of view of up to $2.5 \times 2.5~\mathrm{cm}^2$ with a total acquisition time of approximately $6~\mathrm{s}$ per dataset. Quantitative evaluation shows that both scanning strategies demonstrate improved image quality, including enhanced brightness uniformity, increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and reduced seam-related artifacts after image processing, while preserving a lateral resolution of $7.81~μ\mathrm{m}$. Overall, the presented framework provides a practical and efficient solution for scan-based wide-field microscopic mosaicking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed OCT acquisitions degrade spatial resolution and increase speckle noise, making accurate interpretation challenging for clinical applications like surgical planning and diagnosis.

Method: Advanced super-resolution framework using diffusion model plug-and-play priors, formulating reconstruction as a Bayesian inverse problem with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and pretrained generative priors to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: Method yields more precise anatomical structures, improved corneal layer delineation, and superior noise suppression compared to bicubic interpolation, U-Net baselines, and alternative diffusion priors, with state-of-the-art quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, perceptual scores).

Conclusion: Diffusion-driven plug-and-play reconstruction enables high-fidelity OCT imaging for reliable clinical assessments and image-guided interventions, with potential extension to other biomedical imaging modalities requiring robust super-resolution and denoising.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is pivotal in corneal imaging for both surgical planning and diagnosis. However, high-speed acquisitions often degrade spatial resolution and increase speckle noise, posing challenges for accurate interpretation. We propose an advanced super-resolution framework leveraging diffusion model plug-and-play (PnP) priors to achieve 4x spatial resolution enhancement alongside effective denoising of OCT Bscan images. Our approach formulates reconstruction as a principled Bayesian inverse problem, combining Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling with pretrained generative priors to enforce anatomical consistency. We comprehensively validate the framework using \emph{in vivo} fisheye corneal datasets, to assess robustness and scalability under diverse clinical settings. Comparative experiments against bicubic interpolation, conventional supervised U-Net baselines, and alternative diffusion priors demonstrate that our method consistently yields more precise anatomical structures, improved delineation of corneal layers, and superior noise suppression. Quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and perceptual metrics. This work highlights the potential of diffusion-driven plug-and-play reconstruction to deliver high-fidelity, high-resolution OCT imaging, supporting more reliable clinical assessments and enabling advanced image-guided interventions. Our findings suggest the approach can be extended to other biomedical imaging modalities requiring robust super-resolution and denoising.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic DALK surgery needs accurate real-time depth feedback to approach Descemet's membrane without perforation. Current M-mode OCT provides depth traces but suffers from speckle noise, attenuation, and instrument shadowing, leading to discontinuous/ambiguous layer interfaces that challenge consistent segmentation at deployment frame rates.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, topology-aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt architecture that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Result: Achieves end-to-end throughput exceeding 80 Hz on a single GPU (complete preprocessing-inference-overlay pipeline), providing temporal headroom to reject low-quality frames while maintaining stable effective depth update rate. Evaluation shows improved qualitative boundary stability compared to topology-agnostic controls while preserving real-time performance.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates practical real-time guidance for robotic DALK surgery beyond model-only timing, with topology regularization effectively handling noisy OCT data while maintaining deployable real-time performance.

Abstract: Robotic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) requires accurate real time depth feedback to approach Descemet's membrane (DM) without perforation. M-mode intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high temporal resolution depth traces, but speckle noise, attenuation, and instrument induced shadowing often result in discontinuous or ambiguous layer interfaces that challenge anatomically consistent segmentation at deployment frame rates. We present a lightweight, topology aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed system achieves end to end throughput exceeding 80 Hz measured over the complete preprocessing inference overlay pipeline on a single GPU, demonstrating practical real time guidance beyond model only timing. This operating margin provides temporal headroom to reject low quality or dropout frames while maintaining a stable effective depth update rate. Evaluation on a standard rabbit eye M-mode dataset using an established baseline protocol shows improved qualitative boundary stability compared with topology agnostic controls, while preserving deployable real time performance.

*Kun Wang,Xiao Feng,Mingcheng Qu,Tonghua Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HMVLA is a novel Vision Language Action framework that uses hyperbolic space embeddings and Mixture of Experts for better semantic alignment in robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA methods often directly fine-tune pre-trained VLMs without fully addressing the unique semantic alignment challenges in the VLA domain, particularly the hierarchical relationships in vision-language data.

Method: Proposes HMVLA framework that: 1) embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space instead of Euclidean space to better model hierarchical relationships, and 2) introduces a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts mechanism tailored for semantic alignment to enhance multimodal comprehension.

Result: Extensive experiments show HMVLA surpasses baseline methods in both accuracy and generalization. Additional validation through dataset reconstruction demonstrates robust cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: HMVLA effectively addresses semantic alignment challenges in VLA models by leveraging hyperbolic space embeddings and MoE mechanisms, resulting in superior performance and generalization compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models have recently shown great potential in bridging multimodal perception with robotic control. However, existing methods often rely on direct fine-tuning of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), feeding semantic and visual features directly into a policy network without fully addressing the unique semantic alignment challenges in the VLA domain. In this paper, we propose HMVLA, a novel VLA framework that exploits the inherent hierarchical structures in vision and language for comprehensive semantic alignment. Unlike traditional methods that perform alignment in Euclidean space, our HMVLA embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space, enabling more effective modeling of the hierarchical relationships present in image text data. Furthermore, we introduce a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism tailored for semantic alignment, which enhances multimodal comprehension between images and text while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HMVLA surpasses baseline methods in both accuracy and generalization. In addition, we validate its robustness by reconstructing datasets to further test cross domain adaptability.

*Xubo Luo,Aodi Wu,Haodong Han,Xue Wan,Wei Zhang,Leizheng Shu,Ruisuo Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: StepNav introduces structured multimodal trajectory priors for visual navigation, replacing unstructured noise with geometry-aware success probability fields to generate safer, more efficient plans in fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for visual navigation rely on unstructured noise priors, leading to unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that fail to meet real-time requirements and struggle in cluttered, uncertain environments.

Method: StepNav learns geometry-aware success probability fields to identify feasible navigation corridors, constructs explicit multimodal mixture priors, and refines trajectories using conditional flow-matching formulated as an optimal control problem with smoothness and safety regularization.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world benchmarks show consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, with significantly fewer steps needed for trajectory generation.

Conclusion: StepNav advances reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation by replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded structured priors, enabling safer and more efficient planning in complex environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation is fundamental to autonomous systems, yet generating reliable trajectories in cluttered and uncertain environments remains a core challenge. Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation. The code has been released at https://github.com/LuoXubo/StepNav.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous racing has advanced rapidly on scaled platforms, but existing software stacks are often fragmented or monolithic, making development slow and benchmarking difficult.

Conclusion: The combination of AROLA's modular architecture and Race Monitor's evaluation framework shows that standardized interfaces and systematic performance monitoring can significantly accelerate development and improve reproducibility in autonomous racing systems.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has advanced rapidly, particularly on scaled platforms, and software stacks must evolve accordingly.

*Anmol Gupta,Weiwei Gu,Omkar Patil,Jun Ki Lee,Nakul Gopalan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PokeNet is an end-to-end framework that learns articulation models from single human demonstrations without prior object knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 27% on joint estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing articulation modeling approaches have limitations: they require prior knowledge about objects (joint types/numbers), fail to recover occluded joints, need many multi-view images, and neglect manipulation order which is crucial for multi-DoF objects like dishwashers.

Method: PokeNet is an end-to-end framework that takes a sequence of point cloud observations from a single human demonstration, predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time without requiring prior object knowledge.

Result: PokeNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by over 27% average across diverse objects including novel and unseen categories, demonstrated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: PokeNet enables effective articulation modeling from minimal human demonstrations without prior knowledge, addressing key limitations of existing approaches and showing strong performance on diverse objects.

Abstract: Articulation modeling enables robots to learn joint parameters of articulated objects for effective manipulation which can then be used downstream for skill learning or planning. Existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge about the objects, such as the number or type of joints. Some of these approaches also fail to recover occluded joints that are only revealed during interaction. Others require large numbers of multi-view images for every object, which is impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, prior works neglect the order of manipulations, which is essential for many multi-DoF objects where one joint must be operated before another, such as a dishwasher. We introduce PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from a single human demonstration without prior object knowledge. Given a sequence of point cloud observations of a human manipulating an unknown object, PokeNet predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time. PokeNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by an average of over 27% across diverse objects, including novel and unseen categories. We demonstrate these gains in both simulation and real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) need assistance with daily household tasks but paralysis limits access to traditional robot control interfaces like joysticks or keyboards.

Method: 1) Custom fabric-integrated HDEMG forearm sleeves capture residual neuromotor activity for gesture-based control; 2) Shared autonomy framework integrating vision, language, and motion planning for robust teleoperation; 3) 12-day in-home user study evaluating real-time use.

Result: System enables effective robot control for performing activities of daily living and household tasks in real home environment, demonstrated through successful in-home deployment.

Conclusion: The integrated system combining wearable EMG interface with shared autonomy framework successfully enables quadriplegic users to control mobile manipulators for household tasks, addressing accessibility limitations of traditional interfaces.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in the home can enable people with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) to perform daily physical household tasks that they could not otherwise do themselves. However, paralysis in these users often limits access to traditional robot control interfaces such as joysticks or keyboards. In this work, we introduce and deploy the first system that enables a user with quadriplegia to control a mobile manipulator in their own home using bimanual high-density electromyography (HDEMG). We develop a pair of custom, fabric-integrated HDEMG forearm sleeves, worn on both arms, that capture residual neuromotor activity from clinically paralyzed degrees of freedom and support real-time gesture-based robot control. Second, by integrating vision, language, and motion planning modules, we introduce a shared autonomy framework that supports robust and user-driven teleoperation, with particular benefits for navigation-intensive tasks in home environments. Finally, to demonstrate the system in the wild, we present a twelve-day in-home user study evaluating real-time use of the wearable EMG interface for daily robot control. Together, these system components enable effective robot control for performing activities of daily living and other household tasks in a real home environment.

*Yutaka Shimizu,Masayoshi Tomizuka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LP-MBD simplifies diffusion model scheduling with linear probability paths, and ALP-MBD adapts parameters via RL for better robotic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for robotic control but require extensive parameter tuning of scheduling parameters, which is challenging and sensitive to task/environment changes.

Method: LP-MBD replaces variance-preserving schedule with flow-matching-inspired linear probability path for geometric interpretability and decoupled parameterization. ALP-MBD adds reinforcement learning to adapt diffusion steps and noise levels based on task complexity and environmental conditions.

Result: LP-MBD simplifies scheduling while maintaining strong performance across numerical studies, Brax benchmarks, and mobile-robot trajectory tracking. ALP-MBD further improves robustness, adaptability, and real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed linear path approach reduces tuning complexity and provides stable foundation for adaptation, with RL-based adaptive version enhancing performance for real-world robotic control applications.

Abstract: The interest in combining model-based control approaches with diffusion models has been growing. Although we have seen many impressive robotic control results in difficult tasks, the performance of diffusion models is highly sensitive to the choice of scheduling parameters, making parameter tuning one of the most critical challenges. We introduce Linear Path Model-Based Diffusion (LP-MBD), which replaces the variance-preserving schedule with a flow-matching-inspired linear probability path. This yields a geometrically interpretable and decoupled parameterization that reduces tuning complexity and provides a stable foundation for adaptation. Building on this, we propose Adaptive LP-MBD (ALP-MBD), which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust diffusion steps and noise levels according to task complexity and environmental conditions. Across numerical studies, Brax benchmarks, and mobile-robot trajectory tracking, LP-MBD simplifies scheduling while maintaining strong performance, and ALP-MBD further improves robustness, adaptability, and real-time efficiency.

*Yinlong Dai,Benjamin A. Christie,Daniel J. Evans,Dylan P. Losey,Simon Stepputtis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LMPs bridge high-level VLM reasoning with low-level robot control using DMP parameterization for zero-shot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a disconnect between abstract task reasoning from VLMs and low-level motion control in robotics. VLMs can understand tasks but struggle to ground them in robot motion, while robotics models need fine-tuning for novel tasks.

Method: Language Movement Primitives (LMPs) ground VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. VLMs set interpretable DMP parameters to generate diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories for robot manipulation.

Result: LMP achieves 80% task success rate across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline.

Conclusion: LMPs effectively bridge the gap between high-level natural language task reasoning and low-level robot motion control, enabling zero-shot manipulation with significantly improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline. See videos at our website: https://collab.me.vt.edu/lmp

*Nicolas Perrault,Qi Heng Ho,Morteza Lahijanian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kino-PAX⁺ is a massively parallel kinodynamic motion planner with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees that achieves orders of magnitude speedup over serial methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) struggle with real-time performance due to serial computation, and existing parallel approaches lack optimality guarantees while only focusing on finding feasible solutions.

Method: Decomposes traditionally serial operations into three massively parallel subroutines, builds a sparse tree of dynamically feasible trajectories, and focuses computation on the most promising nodes within local neighborhoods for propagation and refinement.

Result: Finds solutions up to three orders of magnitude faster than existing serial methods and achieves lower solution costs than state-of-the-art GPU-based planners while maintaining probabilistic δ-robust completeness.

Conclusion: Kino-PAX⁺ provides a massively parallel kinodynamic motion planner with both asymptotic near-optimality guarantees and practical performance improvements, addressing the limitations of both serial and existing parallel SBMPs.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used for robot motion planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, yet they struggle to achieve \emph{real-time} performance due to their serial computation design. Recent efforts to parallelize SBMPs have achieved significant speedups in finding feasible solutions; however, they provide no guarantees of optimizing an objective function. We introduce Kino-PAX$^{+}$, a massively parallel kinodynamic SBMP with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees. Kino-PAX$^{+}$ builds a sparse tree of dynamically feasible trajectories by decomposing traditionally serial operations into three massively parallel subroutines. The algorithm focuses computation on the most promising nodes within local neighborhoods for propagation and refinement, enabling rapid improvement of solution cost. We prove that, while maintaining probabilistic $δ$-robust completeness, this focus on promising nodes ensures asymptotic $δ$-robust near-optimality. Our results show that Kino-PAX$^{+}$ finds solutions up to three orders of magnitude faster than existing serial methods and achieves lower solution costs than a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner.

*Kevin Alcedo,Pedro U. Lima,Rachid Alami*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic architecture for socially-aware robot decision-making that learns structured mental-models and uses amortized Schrödinger Bridges for perspective-shift to enable efficient mental-state planning in social navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating alongside humans need to reason about others' hidden mental-models and mental-states under uncertainty. Existing approaches like Interactive POMDPs and Bayesian Theory of Mind are either intractable for exact nested-belief inference or brittle with hand-specified models in open-world settings.

Method: 1) Uses Influence-Based Abstraction to instantiate an Influence-Augmented Local Model that decomposes tasks into local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors. 2) Proposes a neuro-symbolic world model as a factored, discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network. 3) Introduces a perspective-shift operator modeled as an amortized Schrödinger Bridge over learned local dynamics to transport egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs.

Result: The architecture enables agents to synthesize socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning through decision-time mental-state planning (Schrödinger Bridge in belief space), with preliminary results demonstrated in a MiniGrid social navigation task.

Conclusion: The approach addresses both tractability and brittleness issues in social robot decision-making by learning structured mental-models and using efficient amortized inference for perspective-taking, enabling practical socially-aware planning in complex environments.

Abstract: Operating in environments alongside humans requires robots to make decisions under uncertainty. In addition to exogenous dynamics, they must reason over others' hidden mental-models and mental-states. While Interactive POMDPs and Bayesian Theory of Mind formulations are principled, exact nested-belief inference is intractable, and hand-specified models are brittle in open-world settings. We address both by learning structured mental-models and an estimator of others' mental-states. Building on the Influence-Based Abstraction, we instantiate an Influence-Augmented Local Model to decompose socially-aware robot tasks into local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors. We propose (a) a neuro-symbolic world model instantiating a factored, discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network, and (b) a perspective-shift operator modeled as an amortized Schrödinger Bridge over the learned local dynamics that transports factored egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs. We show that this architecture enables agents to synthesize socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning, via decision-time mental-state planning (a Schrödinger Bridge in belief space), with preliminary results in a MiniGrid social navigation task.

TL;DR: MARL-based approach for autonomous UAV teams to explore GNSS-denied indoor environments with communication constraints, using continuous actions and high-fidelity simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in coordinating autonomous UAV teams for exploration in GNSS-denied environments, overcoming limitations of prior work including discrete actions, centralized approaches, and unrealistic connectivity assumptions.

Method: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with continuous action spaces in Godot simulation, using ND-POMDPs with LiDAR sensors and local map sharing. Features curriculum learning across five complexity levels, with ablation studies on training paradigms, rewards, communication, and neural architectures.

Result: Scalable training paradigm with simplified architecture enables rapid autonomous indoor exploration. Curriculum learning accelerates and robustifies training, establishing foundation for physical deployment.

Conclusion: Combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency provides strong basis for deploying learned cooperative strategies in real robotic systems.

Abstract: The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive CoT reasoning introduces significant inference latency that makes it impractical for real-time autonomous driving applications, despite enhancing decision-making capabilities.

Method: Introduces parallel decoding method that decomposes reasoning into dependency graph of sub-tasks (identifying critical objects, summarizing traffic rules), allowing independent steps to be generated concurrently in single forward pass.

Result: Achieves 3-4× speedup in CoT generation and substantial reduction in end-to-end latency across various model architectures while preserving downstream task improvements from CoT reasoning.

Conclusion: FastDriveCoT enables practical real-time CoT reasoning for autonomous driving by parallelizing template-structured reasoning without sacrificing the decision-making benefits of CoT.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the decision-making capabilities of vision-language-action models in autonomous driving, but its autoregressive nature introduces significant inference latency, making it impractical for real-time applications. To address this, we introduce FastDriveCoT, a novel parallel decoding method that accelerates template-structured CoT. Our approach decomposes the reasoning process into a dependency graph of distinct sub-tasks, such as identifying critical objects and summarizing traffic rules, some of which can be generated in parallel. By generating multiple independent reasoning steps concurrently within a single forward pass, we significantly reduce the number of sequential computations. Experiments demonstrate a 3-4$\times$ speedup in CoT generation and a substantial reduction in end-to-end latency across various model architectures, all while preserving the original downstream task improvements brought by incorporating CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: DEFT is a diffusion-based trajectory generator that enables robots to complete tasks despite actuation failures, outperforming baselines by 2x in simulation and succeeding in real-world tasks where classical methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot failures require human intervention and disrupt operations. The goal is to achieve "fail-active" operation - maintaining safe operation under impairment to complete tasks, specifically focusing on actuation failures.

Method: DEFT: A diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment (including failures) and task constraints. It generalizes across failure types and supports both constrained and unconstrained motions.

Result: In simulation: Outperformed baseline by up to 2x across thousands of joint-failure cases. Showed robust generalization to unseen failures. Real-world: Successfully completed drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing tasks where classical methods failed.

Conclusion: DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments, enabling robots to complete tasks despite actuation impairments without human intervention.

Abstract: Robot failure is detrimental and disruptive, often requiring human intervention to recover. Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular robotic system using inflatable fabric tubes and pinch-roller joints for lunar applications, enabling shape-changing structures and locomotion without additional compressed air.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions by creating lightweight, modular, and reconfigurable robotic systems that can adapt to various tasks in space environments.

Method: The system uses truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A spherical joint allows up to three triangles to connect, enabling complex truss assemblies. Roller units pinch the tubes to create effective joints, and electric motors translate the rollers along tubes to change shape while maintaining constant perimeter (isoperimetric).

Result: The system achieves a 1:18.3 stowed-to-deployed volume ratio and can operate untethered after initial inflation. Demonstrations include a 12-DOF solar array capable of 60° tilt and 360° sweep, and a 14-DOF locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait.

Conclusion: This modular, shape-adaptive system provides a versatile solution for lunar applications, enabling both stationary structures (like solar arrays) and mobile platforms through reconfigurable inflatable truss technology.

Abstract: We introduce a large-scale robotic system designed as a lightweight, modular, and reconfigurable structure for lunar applications. The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric). This shape-changing process requires no additional compressed air, enabling untethered operation after initial inflation. We demonstrate the system as a 12-degree-of-freedom solar array capable of tilting up to 60 degrees and sweeping 360 degrees, and as a 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait. This modular, shape-adaptive system addresses key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions.

*Quanquan Peng,Yunfeng Lin,Yufei Xue,Jiangmiao Pang,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EAGLE: An iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy to control multiple heterogeneous humanoid robots without per-robot reward tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-trained humanoid whole-body controllers typically target single robot embodiments, failing to generalize across diverse humanoids with variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom, and kinematic topology. There's a need for a generalist policy that transfers across different embodiments while supporting richer behaviors beyond simple walking.

Method: EAGLE uses an iterative distillation framework: embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. This cycle repeats until performance convergence.

Result: Validated on robots including Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. Experiments conducted on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods.

Conclusion: EAGLE represents a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control by producing a single unified policy capable of controlling multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning.

Abstract: Humanoid Whole-Body Controllers trained with reinforcement learning (RL) have recently achieved remarkable performance, yet many target a single robot embodiment. Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

TL;DR: RPL is a two-stage training framework for humanoid robots enabling robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains with payloads, using terrain-specific expert policies distilled into a transformer policy with depth cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid perceptive locomotion has made progress but achieving robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains remains underexplored and challenging.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Train terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height maps, 2) Distill into transformer policy using multiple depth cameras. Introduces depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking. Develops efficient multi-depth system with ray-casting for 5x speedup over existing simulators.

Conclusion: RPL successfully enables robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains with payloads through a novel two-stage training framework and efficient depth sensing system.

Abstract: Humanoid perceptive locomotion has made significant progress and shows great promise, yet achieving robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we propose RPL, a two-stage training framework that enables multi-directional locomotion on challenging terrains, and remains robust with payloads. RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20° slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps.

*Baixiao Huang,Baiyu Huang,Yu Hou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage end-to-end deep RL enables quadruped robots to navigate and climb various indoor staircases for fire search missions, transferring skills from abstract to realistic stair topologies using local height-map perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots need to perform primary searches during indoor fires, but face challenges with situational awareness in complex environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircase types.

Method: Two-stage end-to-end deep RL approach: Stage 1 trains quadrupeds on pyramid-stair terrain; Stage 2 transfers learned policy to realistic indoor staircases (straight, L-shaped, spiral) using centerline-based navigation formulation and local height-map perception.

Result: Demonstrated policy generalization across diverse staircases, with empirical analysis of success rates, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty.

Conclusion: The approach enables quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes, balancing navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning, supporting robot-assisted primary searches in complex indoor fire scenarios.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are used for primary searches during the early stages of indoor fires. A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies. (2) A centerline-based navigation formulation that enables unified learning of navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning. (3) Demonstration of policy generalization across diverse staircases using only local height-map perception. (4) An empirical analysis of success, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty.

### [210] [A Unified Candidate Set with Scene-Adaptive Refinement via Diffusion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03112)
*Zhengfei Wu,Shuaixi Pan,Shuohan Chen,Shuo Yang,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CdDrive improves autonomous driving planning by combining fixed trajectory vocabulary with scene-adaptive diffusion-generated candidates, using HATNA for smoothness and joint scoring for reliable performance across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal planning approaches face a trade-off: fixed trajectory vocabularies provide stable coverage but miss optimal solutions in complex interactions, while scene-adaptive refinement can over-correct in simple scenarios by unnecessarily modifying already good trajectories.

Method: CdDrive preserves original vocabulary candidates and augments them with scene-adaptive candidates generated by vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module. HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) improves smoothness and geometric continuity through temporal smoothing and horizon-aware noise modulation.

Result: Experiments on NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2 demonstrate leading performance. Ablation studies verify the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: CdDrive effectively addresses the limitations of both fixed vocabulary and scene-adaptive approaches by combining their strengths, achieving reliable performance across both routine and highly interactive driving scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving is increasingly adopting a multimodal planning paradigm that generates multiple trajectory candidates and selects the final plan, making candidate-set design critical. A fixed trajectory vocabulary provides stable coverage in routine driving but often misses optimal solutions in complex interactions, while scene-adaptive refinement can cause over-correction in simple scenarios by unnecessarily perturbing already strong vocabulary trajectories.We propose CdDrive, which preserves the original vocabulary candidates and augments them with scene-adaptive candidates generated by vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module, enabling reliable performance across routine and highly interactive scenarios. We further introduce HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) to improve the smoothness and geometric continuity of diffusion candidates via temporal smoothing and horizon-aware noise modulation. Experiments on NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2 demonstrate leading performance, and ablations verify the contribution of each component.

*Runfeng Zhu,Xin Zhong,Qingxiang Zhao,Jing Lin,Zhong Wu,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot structure enables endoscopic pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity for accessing deep thin branches of pulmonary arteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rigid tools for Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy lack distal dexterity to access thin branches of tortuous pulmonary arteries, limiting surgical effectiveness.

Method: Developed a CPPR-based robotized dissector with 3.5mm diameter, dual-segment-bending capability, central lumen for irrigation/tool channels and endoscopic camera. Established optimization-based kinematics model for accurate positioning.

Result: Achieved 2mm positioning accuracy for 60mm tip tool under open-loop control. Demonstrated dexterity and advantages in surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung with evaluated stiffness, motion accuracy, and maneuverability.

Conclusion: The robotized dissector enables endoscopic PTE with improved access to deep thin pulmonary artery branches, potentially upgrading traditional PTE procedures with enhanced surgical manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Patients suffering chronic severe pulmonary thromboembolism need Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy (PTE) to remove the thromb and intima located inside pulmonary artery (PA). During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE. Basic physic performance of the robotized dissector including stiffness, motion accuracy and maneuverability was evaluated through experiments. Surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung also demonstrates its dexterity and notable advantages in PTE.

*Xuetao Li,Pinhan Fu,Wenke Huang,Nengyuan Pan,Songhua Yang,Kaiyan Zhao,Guancheng Wan,Mengde Li,Jifeng Xuan,Miao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bera is a test-time defense framework that erases backdoors in vision-language-action models by detecting anomalous attention patterns, masking suspicious image regions, and reconstructing trigger-free images without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action models used in robotics are vulnerable to backdoor attacks during fine-tuning, where poisoned data can implant stealthy triggers that cause harmful behavior. Existing defenses lack mechanistic understanding of multimodal backdoors or require expensive full-model retraining.

Method: Bera leverages the discovery that backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near clean manifolds. It detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs trigger-free images to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs.

Conclusion: Bera offers a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems against backdoor attacks, requiring neither retraining of VLAs nor changes to the training pipeline, making it computationally efficient compared to prior defenses.

Abstract: Downstream fine-tuning of vision-language-action (VLA) models enhances robotics, yet exposes the pipeline to backdoor risks. Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A force-plate-free method to estimate ground reaction forces (GRFs) using only marker-based motion capture data, enabling clinical gait analysis without force plates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRFs are clinically important for gait analysis but underutilized due to practical limitations of force plate systems. There's a need for accessible methods that don't require dedicated force plates.

Method: Uses kinematics-only approach with marker-based motion capture from sixteen body segments to estimate center of mass (CoM), then computes GRFs and decomposes them into individual components through a minimization-based approach.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis. The method can identify gait stance phases and provide clinically meaningful kinetic measures.

Conclusion: The kinematics-only method for estimating and decomposing GRFs is well-suited for widespread clinical deployment, making GRF analysis accessible without dedicated force plate systems.

Abstract: Ground reaction forces (GRFs) provide fundamental insight into human gait mechanics and are widely used to assess joint loading, limb symmetry, balance control, and motor function. Despite their clinical relevance, the use of GRF remains underutilised in clinical workflows due to the practical limitations of force plate systems. In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis.

*Yu-Han Shu,Toshiaki Tsuji,Sho Sakaino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical imitation learning framework uses motion primitives with proportion-based synthesis to improve data efficiency and adaptability for complex robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning requires extensive high-quality data and retraining for complex/long-horizon tasks. Need more data-efficient and adaptable approach for robot motion skill acquisition.

Method: Two-layer hierarchical architecture: upper layer for long-term planning, lower layer models learn individual motion primitives. Three variants explore proportion determination: learning-based (trainable upper layer), sampling-based, and playback-based proportion models.

Result: Successfully generated complex motions not in primitive set through real-robot pick-and-place experiments. Sampling-based and playback-based models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than standard hierarchical model.

Conclusion: Proportion-based motion integration effectively improves practical robot learning, with sampling-based and playback-based models showing better stability and adaptability than learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire human-like motion skills from demonstrations, but it still requires extensive high-quality data and retraining to handle complex or long-horizon tasks. To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning.

TL;DR: HUSKY is a learning-based framework that enables humanoid robots to perform stable and agile skateboarding by integrating system modeling, physics-aware whole-body control, and human-like motion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid whole-body control frameworks rely on static environment assumptions, making it difficult to handle highly dynamic tasks like skateboarding that involve complex interactions with underactuated wheeled platforms and non-holonomic constraints.

Method: HUSKY integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling (coupling between board tilt and truck steering angles) with physics-aware whole-body control. It uses Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions, employs a physics-guided heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors, and implements a trajectory-guided mechanism for smooth transitions between pushing and steering.

Result: Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that the framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: HUSKY successfully addresses the challenges of humanoid skateboarding by combining system modeling with learning-based control, enabling dynamic maneuvering on underactuated wheeled platforms despite non-holonomic constraints and complex human-object interactions.

Abstract: While current humanoid whole-body control frameworks predominantly rely on the static environment assumptions, addressing tasks characterized by high dynamism and complex interactions presents a formidable challenge. In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust depth perception for field robots using synthetic training data and sparse depth measurements, overcoming limitations of monocular depth estimation while maintaining real-time performance on embedded platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms.

Motivation: Power line detection is challenging for both human UAV pilots and autonomous systems, increasing collision risks during flight operations near power infrastructure.

Method: Multiple compact solid-state mmWave radar modules are integrated to create omnidirectional sensing coverage around a small UAV, with a tailored detection-and-avoidance algorithm developed for this radar arrangement.

Result: Field tests show reliable detection up to 10m range, successful avoidance at speeds over 10 m/s, and detection of wires as thin as 1.2mm diameter.

Conclusion: The mmWave radar approach provides a suitable additional safety layer for both autonomous and manual UAV flight operations near power lines.

Abstract: Detecting and estimating distances to power lines is a challenge for both human UAV pilots and autonomous systems, which increases the risk of unintended collisions. We present a mmWave radar-based perception system that provides spherical sensing coverage around a small UAV for robust power line detection and avoidance. The system integrates multiple compact solid-state mmWave radar modules to synthesize an omnidirectional field of view while remaining lightweight. We characterize the sensing behavior of this omnidirectional radar arrangement in power line environments and develop a robust detection-and-avoidance algorithm tailored to that behavior. Field experiments on real power lines demonstrate reliable detection at ranges up to 10 m, successful avoidance maneuvers at flight speeds upwards of 10 m/s, and detection of wires as thin as 1.2 mm in diameter. These results indicate the approach's suitability as an additional safety layer for both autonomous and manual UAV flight.

Conclusion: The speckle-based approach provides a novel tactile-sensing paradigm that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, demonstrating potential for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles.

TL;DR: iDCOL is an implicit differentiable collision detection framework that uses geometric regularization of degenerate shapes to enable smooth contact kinematics for gradient-based robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based robotics methods, but degenerate configurations (shapes with zero/undefined curvature) create non-smooth contact maps, limiting their applicability.

Method: Regularizes degenerate geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, solves collision detection via geometric scaling-based convex optimization, applies Implicit Function Theorem for analytical derivatives, and implements fast Newton-based solver in C++.

Result: Developed iDCOL framework that restores uniqueness and smoothness of contact maps, enabling robust differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics for gradient-based applications.

Conclusion: iDCOL provides a robust differentiable collision framework that enables gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, demonstrated through multi-body rigid collisions and soft-robot interactions.

Abstract: Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based methods in robotics, yet the mapping from robot state to contact distance, location, and normal becomes non-smooth in degenerate configurations of shapes with zero or undefined curvature. We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point contact models are computationally efficient but limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich manipulation because they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation.

Method: Introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model and constructs a bi-level optimization framework: lower-level solves optimization for contact force computation, upper-level applies iLQR for trajectory optimization.

Result: FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot compared to point contact models.

Conclusion: The FDLC model demonstrates benefits over conventional point contact models for generating efficient and robust trajectories in contact-rich manipulation, validated through a box rotating task.

Abstract: Efficient and robust trajectories play a crucial role in contact-rich manipulation, which demands accurate mod- eling of object-robot interactions. Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot.

Conclusion: LAS-MP successfully addresses the challenge of quadruped robot stabilization on moving platforms through a learning-based approach with adaptive posture adjustment and state estimation.

Abstract: A quadruped robot faces balancing challenges on a six-degrees-of-freedom moving platform, like subways, buses, airplanes, and yachts, due to independent platform motions and resultant diverse inertia forces on the robot. To alleviate these challenges, we present the Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms (\textit{LAS-MP}), featuring a self-balancing policy and system state estimators. The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data. For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the \textit{LAS-MP}, including ablation studies and evaluation of the estimators, to validate the effectiveness of each component.

*Constantin Selzer,Fabina B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PTR is a unified Transformer framework that integrates prediction and planning by combining goal-conditioned prediction with dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane topology reasoning, using teacher-student training to handle unknown agent intentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems have a disconnect between prediction (which forecasts multimodal agent motions without knowing intentions) and planning (which assumes known ego objectives). This creates a bottleneck where prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions while planning needs this information, and existing prediction models ignore planning constraints like collision avoidance.

Method: Plan Transformer (PTR) uses a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. It employs teacher-student training that progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable.

Result: PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to Motion Transformer (MTR) baseline and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design works with diverse Transformer-based prediction models.

Conclusion: PTR successfully bridges the gap between prediction and planning in autonomous driving by creating a unified framework that handles unknown agent intentions while incorporating planning constraints, leading to significant performance improvements in both prediction accuracy and planning quality.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models. Project Website: https://github.com/SelzerConst/PlanTRansformer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots have limited long-range navigation efficiency due to reliance on legs. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by enabling robots to ride personal transporters, similar to how humans use Segways, to expand operational range and efficiency.

Method: Introduces RL-ATR (Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding) with three key components: 1) a transporter riding policy that learns maneuvering strategies based on transporter-specific control dynamics, 2) two state estimators that resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states.

Result: Simulation evaluations show proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Ablation studies quantify individual component contributions within RL-ATR.

Conclusion: The riding ability broadens locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding their operational range and efficiency by enabling them to use personal transporters for more efficient long-range navigation.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.

TL;DR: DESectBot: A dual-segment continuum robot with integrated forceps for endoscopic submucosal dissection, controlled by GRU-based deep learning for superior 6-DoF tip dexterity and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ESD is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity, motivating development of more advanced robotic solutions for improved lesion targeting.

Method: Developed DESectBot - a dual-segment continuum robot with decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps. Proposed GRU-based deep learning controllers for simultaneous tip position/orientation control, benchmarked against Jacobian IK, MPC, FNN, and LSTM networks.

Result: GRU achieved lowest position/orientation RMSEs in trajectory tracking (1.11mm/4.62° and 0.81mm/2.59°). For orientation control: mean RMSE 0.14mm/0.72°. Peg transfer: 100% success rate (120/120) with 11.8s average time. Ex vivo ESD demonstration confirmed sufficient stiffness and adequate workspace.

Conclusion: GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios, with DESectBot providing improved lesion targeting capability for endoscopic procedures.

Abstract: Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.

TL;DR: Learning-based initial trajectory generation for manipulator trajectory optimization using example-guided reinforcement learning with null-space constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory optimization performance depends heavily on initial trajectory quality, but selecting good initial trajectories is difficult due to large solution space and lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space.

Method: Proposes a learning-based initial trajectory generation method using example-guided reinforcement learning with null-space projected imitation reward to efficiently learn kinematically feasible motion from expert demonstrations while considering null-space constraints.

Result: Statistical evaluation in simulation shows improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of trajectory optimization when using the method's output, outperforming three baselines. Real-world experiments with a 7-DOF manipulator demonstrate performance improvement and feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based method effectively generates high-quality initial trajectories for trajectory optimization in a short time budget, addressing the challenge of initial trajectory selection for redundant manipulators following Cartesian paths.

Abstract: Trajectory optimization (TO) is an efficient tool to generate a redundant manipulator's joint trajectory following a 6-dimensional Cartesian path. The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing proactive agents is hindered by lack of specialized resources. Current agents are passive (follow instructions) rather than proactive (align with higher-level objectives like assistance and safety through continuous monitoring).

Method: Introduce ProAct-75 benchmark with 75 tasks, 91,581 step-level annotations and explicit task graphs encoding dependencies and parallel execution. Propose ProAct-Helper baseline using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decisions in state detection and leverages task graphs for entropy-driven heuristic search, enabling parallel thread execution.

Result: ProAct-Helper outperforms strong closed-source models: improves trigger detection mF1 by 6.21%, saves 0.25 more steps in online one-step decision, and increases parallel action rate by 15.58%.

Conclusion: The ProAct-75 benchmark enables training and evaluation of proactive agents across diverse domains, and the ProAct-Helper baseline demonstrates effective proactive decision-making through state detection and task graph-based heuristic search for parallel execution.

Abstract: While passive agents merely follow instructions, proactive agents align with higher-level objectives, such as assistance and safety by continuously monitoring the environment to determine when and how to act. However, developing proactive agents is hindered by the lack of specialized resources. To address this, we introduce ProAct-75, a benchmark designed to train and evaluate proactive agents across diverse domains, including assistance, maintenance, and safety monitoring. Spanning 75 tasks, our dataset features 91,581 step-level annotations enriched with explicit task graphs. These graphs encode step dependencies and parallel execution possibilities, providing the structural grounding necessary for complex decision-making. Building on this benchmark, we propose ProAct-Helper, a reference baseline powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decision-making in state detection, and leveraging task graphs to enable entropy-driven heuristic search for action selection, allowing agents to execute parallel threads independently rather than mirroring the human's next step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProAct-Helper outperforms strong closed-source models, improving trigger detection mF1 by 6.21%, saving 0.25 more steps in online one-step decision, and increasing the rate of parallel actions by 15.58%.

TL;DR: This paper investigates optimal control strategies for dynamic swing-up tasks in underactuated continuum soft robots, addressing computational challenges through analytical derivatives and numerical robustness techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum soft robots are underactuated with intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control challenging. Existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors or use oversimplified template systems, while model-based optimal control faces computational and accuracy limitations with high-dimensional models.

Method: The paper investigates three optimal control strategies (Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control) for underactuated soft systems. It leverages the Geometric Variable Strain model for analytical derivatives, employs implicit integration schemes for stiff dynamics, and uses warm-start strategies for computational efficiency.

Result: The methods are evaluated in simulation on three benchmark systems: Soft Cart-Pole, Soft Pendubot, and Soft Furuta Pendulum. The study highlights performance and computational trade-offs of the different optimal control approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that optimal control strategies can effectively address dynamic swing-up tasks in continuum soft robots when combined with analytical derivatives and robust numerical methods, providing insights into computational efficiency-performance trade-offs for real-world applications.

Abstract: Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: HetroD is a dataset and benchmark for autonomous driving in heterogeneous traffic environments dominated by vulnerable road users (VRUs), addressing gaps in existing datasets that focus on structured, lane-disciplined traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving datasets lack representation of real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists) who exhibit complex behaviors like hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation.

Method: Collected large-scale drone-based dataset with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. Developed modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development.

Result: Dataset contains over 65.4k high-fidelity agent trajectories, 70% from VRUs. Evaluation shows state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with lateral VRU movements, unstructured maneuvers, and dense multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: HetroD bridges the gap in autonomous driving datasets by providing comprehensive heterogeneous traffic data, revealing limitations of current models and highlighting the need for more robust approaches to handle real-world mixed traffic scenarios.

Abstract: We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

TL;DR: CMR framework maps noisy observations to contractive latent space for robust humanoid locomotion under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust disturbance rejection is challenging for humanoid locomotion on unstructured terrains due to unreliable sensing, sensor noise, and sim-to-real gaps that destabilize policies.

Method: Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework maps high-dimensional noisy observations into latent space where local perturbations attenuate over time. Combines contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while controlling sensitivity. Can be added as auxiliary loss in deep RL pipelines.

Result: Extensive humanoid experiments show CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise conditions.

Conclusion: CMR provides theoretical foundation and practical framework for robust humanoid locomotion by creating contractive latent representations that attenuate observation noise over time.

Abstract: Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AR doesn't significantly improve learning experience for robot programming overall, but it compensates for low spatial ability by reducing its negative impact on usability and cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AR shows promise for enhancing learning, its specific mechanisms and effects are not fully understood. As learning becomes more personalized, understanding how individual learner characteristics (like spatial ability) interact with AR becomes increasingly important for designing effective educational technologies.

Method: Between-subjects experiment with 71 participants comparing conventional robot programming to AR-assisted approach using head-mounted displays. Spatial ability measured via Mental Rotation Test. Learning experience assessed through System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load measures.

Result: AR support did not significantly improve overall learning experience compared to conventional approach. However, AR showed compensatory effect: in control group, higher spatial ability predicted better SUS scores and lower extraneous cognitive load; in AR condition, these relationships disappeared, suggesting AR mitigated disadvantages for learners with lower spatial abilities.

Conclusion: AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of individual learner characteristics like spatial ability. This suggests AR could help create more equitable learning environments by reducing barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles. Future research should explore this compensatory role to guide personalized learning environment design.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated driving decision-making approaches oversimplify interactions between ego vehicle and surrounding agents, often neglecting interactions among agents themselves. Classical game theory assumes rational players, but human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational.

Method: Develops Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model that integrates classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (superposition, entanglement, interference) to handle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making. Runs in real-time on standard computers without quantum hardware.

Result: Evaluation in simulation across roundabouts, merging, and highway scenarios shows QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in high-interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: QGDM effectively addresses interaction-awareness challenges in automated driving by modeling complex human behaviors through quantum game theory, offering practical real-time performance without specialized hardware.

Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in autonomy, assistive robots (mobile manipulators and humanoids) still struggle in dynamic environments and require human intervention for failure recovery. Effective human-robot collaboration is needed to assign failures to the most competent operator while reducing workload and minimizing task disruptions.

Method: ARFA models human operator capabilities and continuously updates these beliefs based on actual performance. For each failure, a reward function calculates expected outcomes considering operator capabilities, historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution, then assigns the failure to the operator with highest expected reward.

Result: Simulations and user studies show ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to more distributed workload among operators.

Conclusion: ARFA provides an effective adaptive method for failure allocation in human-robot collaboration systems, enhancing reliability and efficiency in assistive robotics applications.

Abstract: Since the recent Covid-19 pandemic, mobile manipulators and humanoid assistive robots with higher levels of autonomy have increasingly been adopted for patient care and living assistance. Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators.

Maintains performance with noisy/low-frequency state updates and demonstrates sim-to-real generalization in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: SPiD provides a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects with strong sim-to-real generalization, applicable to tasks like rope stabilization and trajectory tracking.

Abstract: We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.

*Fabian Schramm,Franki Nguimatsia Tiofack,Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert,Marc Toussaint,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework integrates prior models to improve sample efficiency and reduce variance in sampling-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based controllers like MPPI offer flexibility but suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency, making them impractical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

Method: Decompose objective function into known approximate model and residual term; use quadratic approximation to derive closed-form, model-guided prior that concentrates samples in informative regions; framework is agnostic to geometric information source (exact derivatives, structural approximations, or gradient-free randomized smoothing).

Result: Achieves faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI across optimization benchmarks, nonlinear cart-pole control, and contact-rich manipulation with non-smooth dynamics.

Conclusion: The method makes sample-based control strategies more practical for expensive or limited sampling scenarios by effectively reducing variance and improving sample efficiency through model-guided priors.

Abstract: Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MVP-LAM learns discrete latent actions from multi-view videos using cross-viewpoint reconstruction, producing more action-centric representations that improve VLA pretraining and downstream manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning latent actions from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific datasets, but current methods may not capture sufficient action information without ground-truth labels.

Method: MVP-LAM learns discrete latent actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos using a cross-viewpoint reconstruction objective, where latent actions from one view must explain future states in another view.

Result: On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions with higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation.

Conclusion: Pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-view learning for action representation.

Abstract: Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

TL;DR: A novel mapping architecture that uses 3D Semantic Scene Graphs as the foundational backend for robotic perception, enabling real-time graph updates and bridging sensor data with high-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating scene graphs as derivative layers generated post hoc, which limits consistency and scalability in large-scale, real-world robotic environments.

Method: Proposes a mapping architecture where 3DSSG serves as the primary knowledge representation, leveraging incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored.

Result: Ensures topological consistency and computational efficiency in large-scale settings, maintains explicit spatially grounded representations supporting both flat and hierarchical topologies.

Conclusion: Bridges gap between raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning, providing stable structure for knowledge-driven frameworks (KGs, ontologies, LLMs) to enhance interpretability, trustworthiness, and human alignment.

Abstract: While Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSGs) are established paradigms in robotic perception, deploying them effectively to support high-level reasoning in large-scale, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.
  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied world models face challenges with misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoints, and non-unified architectures across different robotic embodiments.

Method: BridgeV2W converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks using URDF and camera parameters, injects them into pretrained video generation models via ControlNet-style pathways, and introduces flow-based motion loss to focus on dynamic regions and mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds.

Result: Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets show BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, and demonstrates potential for downstream real-world tasks like policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Conclusion: BridgeV2W provides a unified world model architecture that effectively bridges coordinate-space actions with pixel-space video prediction, addressing key challenges in embodied AI while maintaining generalization across different robotic embodiments and camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A probabilistic verification framework combining conformal prediction with reachability analysis to provide provable safety guarantees for unknown dynamical systems, with policies optimized for both reward and safety horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work on provably safe control assumes either known/deterministic dynamics or finite state/action spaces, which significantly limits real-world application scope. There's a need for safety verification methods that work with unknown dynamical systems.

Method: Combines conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability analysis to verify safety within these conformal uncertainty bounds. Also develops algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while maximizing planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees.

Result: Evaluated in seven safe control settings across four domains (cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation) for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. The learned policies achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while maintaining high average reward.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitation of prior work by providing probabilistic safety verification for unknown dynamical systems, enabling both strong safety guarantees and high performance in complex control domains.

Abstract: Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

### [241] [Joint single-shot ToA and DoA estimation for VAA-based BLE ranging with phase ambiguity: A deep learning-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02503)
*Jincheng Xie,Yili Deng,Jiguang He,Pengyu Wang,Miaomiao Dong,Rui Tang,Zhongyi Huang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: BLE single-antenna DoA estimation using virtual antenna arrays with neural network phase recovery to resolve binary phase ambiguity in two-way CFR, enabling joint ToA/DoA estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLE devices are size-constrained and cannot use costly multi-antenna arrays for DoA estimation. While virtual antenna array techniques enable single-antenna DoA estimation, BLE's single-shot two-way CFR has binary phase ambiguity that prevents direct VAA application.

Method: Propose unified model combining VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce neural network based phase recovery framework with row/column predictors and voting mechanism to resolve phase ambiguity. Recovered one-way CFR enables super-resolution algorithms like MUSIC for joint ToA and DoA estimation.

Result: Superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching Cramer Rao bound at SNR ≥ 5 dB.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables accurate DoA estimation on size-constrained BLE devices using single antenna with virtual arrays, overcoming the binary phase ambiguity limitation of BLE's two-way CFR through neural network phase recovery.

Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.

TL;DR: Researchers analyze Starlink's Ku-band downlink to identify predictable pilot symbols and structural elements that enable precise positioning, navigation, and timing with low-cost receivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable opportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) using Starlink signals with compact, low-gain receivers by exploiting predictable elements in the waveform for maximum signal processing gain.

Method: Developed an acquisition and demodulation framework to decode Starlink frames, identified edge pilots (4QAM symbols at channel edges that repeat identically across all frames, beams, channels, and satellites), and revealed that most QPSK symbols follow a regular tessellated structure on a constant reference template.

Result: Exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields approximately 48 dB processing gain, enabling low-cost compact receivers to extract precise time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams.

Conclusion: Starlink signals contain sufficient predictable elements to enable precise opportunistic PNT with simple receivers, potentially democratizing access to high-precision timing and positioning services.

Abstract: We identify and characterize dedicated pilot symbols and other predictable elements embedded within the Starlink Ku-band downlink waveform. Exploitation of these predictable elements enables precise opportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing using compact, low-gain receivers by maximizing the signal processing gain available for signal acquisition and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. We develop an acquisition and demodulation framework to decode Starlink frames and disclose the explicit sequences of the edge pilots -- bands of 4QAM symbols located at both edges of each Starlink channel that apparently repeat identically across all frames, beams, channels, and satellites. We further reveal that the great majority of QPSK-modulated symbols do not carry high-entropy user data but instead follow a regular tessellated structure superimposed on a constant reference template. We demonstrate that exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields a processing gain of approximately 48 dB, thereby enabling low-cost, compact receivers to extract precise TOA measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR-RIS enables full-space angle estimation using FRI modeling, with two configurations (uniform and nonuniform ES). Proposed proximal-gradient algorithm recovers FRI structure for gridless angle estimation via polynomial root finding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sensor architectures limit angle estimation to half-space only. STAR-RIS can enable full-space angle detection by allowing simultaneous transmission and reflection, overcoming this fundamental limitation.

Method: Develops FRI-based signal model for STAR-RIS with two configurations: (1) element-wise uniform ES coefficients and phase differences, (2) nonuniform ES with common phase difference but varying ES coefficients. Uses proximal-gradient algorithm with alternating projections to recover FRI sampling structure, then constructs annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles for gridless estimation via polynomial root finding.

Result: Derives Ziv-Zakai bound for angle estimation in both configurations. Numerical results show proposed methods operate reliably across both regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead.

Conclusion: STAR-RIS enables full-space angle estimation using FRI modeling framework. The proposed approach with proximal-gradient algorithm and gridless estimation via polynomial root finding provides reliable performance across different STAR-RIS configurations with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Conventional sensor architectures typically restrict angle estimation to the half-space. By enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can support full-space angle detection. This paper develops a fullspace angle estimation framework by leveraging a finite rate of innovation (FRI) model enabled by STAR-RIS. We distinguish two practical STAR-RIS configurations: (i) an element-wise uniform setting, where all metasurface elements share identical energy-splitting (ES) coefficients and phase differences, and (ii) a nonuniform ES setting, where the phase difference is common across elements while the ES coefficients vary element-wise to increase design flexibility. For each regime, we formulate the corresponding FRI-based signal model and derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for angle estimation. To recover the underlying FRI sampling structure, we develop a proximal-gradient algorithm implemented via alternating projections in matrix space and establish its convergence. Exploiting the recovered FRI structure, we construct an annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles, enabling gridless estimation via polynomial root finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods operate reliably across both configuration regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework combines digital, analog, and RHS-based EM layers for low-cost large-scale antenna arrays, achieving joint communication-sensing optimization with reduced phase shifters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is crucial for 6G, but conventional implementations are costly for large-scale antenna arrays. Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) offer low-cost solutions but face challenges in joint phase and amplitude control.

Method: Proposes tri-hybrid holographic ISAC with digital, analog (phase shifters), and RHS (amplitude control) layers. Develops joint optimization of PS phases and RHS amplitude responses to minimize sensing waveform error while meeting communication rate requirements.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows optimized amplitude responses cluster near 1-bit control, reducing complexity. Simulations demonstrate controllable communication-sensing trade-off. Measured RHS beam gain validates holographic beamforming enhancement. Performance exceeds conventional hybrid beamforming with fewer PSs as RHS elements increase.

Conclusion: Tri-hybrid holographic ISAC provides a practical low-cost pathway for large-scale ISAC systems, achieving better performance than conventional approaches while significantly reducing hardware complexity through optimized joint phase and amplitude control.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can perform both communication and sensing tasks using the same frequency band and hardware, making it a key technology for 6G. As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs.

TL;DR: Proposes a probabilistic framework for stationary random signals on simplicial complexes, extending classical stationarity concepts to topological signals with proper spectral characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphs cannot model non-dyadic connections or relationships between sets of nodes, while existing topological signal analysis is primarily deterministic. Need probabilistic framework for random signals on simplicial complexes.

Method: Generalizes classical stationarity using Hodge and Dirac theory spectral dualities. Defines stationary topological signals as outputs of topological filters given white noise. Establishes topological power spectral density (PSD) through spectral characterization.

Result: Successfully extends desirable stationarity properties from time-series and graph signals to topological signals. Provides clear spectral characterization of topological PSD and demonstrates practical benefits through synthetic and real-world simulations.

Conclusion: Proposed probabilistic framework enables proper analysis of random signals on simplicial complexes, with topological stationarity offering advantages through spectral properties and PSD characterization, validated by empirical demonstrations.

Abstract: It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution radar sensors generate multiple measurements per object and suffer from multipath effects, challenging traditional tracking algorithms. Existing solutions either rely on point target assumptions, treat multipath as clutter, or lack trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments.

Method: Develops multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter using labeled random finite set theory. Creates unified Bayesian framework to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and associations between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. Implements joint prediction/update via Gibbs sampling for efficiency and introduces measurement-driven adaptive birth model for track initialization.

Conclusion: The MPET-GLMB filter effectively addresses limitations of existing radar tracking methods by providing a unified framework for handling multipath extended targets, enabling simultaneous target and reflector trajectory estimation without heuristic post-processing, and demonstrating practical performance improvements in complex automotive radar scenarios.

Abstract: High-resolution radar sensors are critical for autonomous systems but pose significant challenges to traditional tracking algorithms due to the generation of multiple measurements per object and the presence of multipath effects. Existing solutions often rely on the point target assumption or treat multipath measurements as clutter, whereas current extended target trackers often lack the capability to maintain trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments.

Conclusion: The conditional diffusion model approach effectively addresses the limitations of conventional optimization and discriminative models for physical layer security, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time wireless security applications.

Abstract: While information securityis a fundamental requirement for wireless communications, conventional optimization based approaches often struggle with real-time implementation, and deep models, typically discriminative in nature, may lack the ability to cope with unforeseen scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the design of legitimate beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to achieve physical layer security by exploiting the conditional diffusion model. Specifically, we reformulate the security optimization as a conditional generative process, using a diffusion model to learn the inherent distribution of near-optimal joint beamforming and AN strategies. We employ a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to integrate channel state information, as the basis for the generative process. Moreover, we fine-tune the trained model using an objective incorporating the sum secrecy rate such that the security performance is further enhanced. Finally, simulation results validate the learning process convergence and demonstrate that the proposed generative method achieves superior secrecy performance across various scenarios as compared with the baselines.

Motivation: Near-field cell-free XL-MIMO systems face high computational complexity challenges in combining schemes, especially for distributed processing. There's a need for low-complexity distributed combining schemes that can maintain spectral efficiency performance while reducing computational burden.

Method: 1. Constructed uplink SE analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized/distributed processing. 2. Derived CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes. 3. Proposed five low-complexity distributed combining schemes: two matrix approximation methods (GSLI-MMSE and SI-LMMSE) using asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, and three SSOR-based LMMSE schemes using iterative matrix inversion with different information and initial values.

Conclusion: The proposed low-complexity distributed combining schemes effectively address the computational challenges in near-field CF XL-MIMO systems, offering practical solutions for implementing efficient distributed processing with reduced complexity while preserving spectral efficiency performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity distributed combining scheme design for near-field cell-free extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (CF XL-MIMO) systems. Firstly, we construct the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized and distributed processing schemes. Notably, we derive the centralized minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) and local minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) combining schemes over arbitrary channel estimators. Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values.

*Zhe Wang,Emil Björnson,Jiayi Zhang,Peng Zhang,Vitaly Petrov,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GSLI-MMSE distributed beamforming for cell-free massive MIMO using local instantaneous info + global statistics, achieving near-centralized performance under stable LoS conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need distributed beamforming for cell-free massive MIMO networks that avoids global instantaneous information sharing while maintaining performance close to optimal centralized MMSE.

Method: Propose GSLI-MMSE combining using matrix inversion derivations and statistics approximation methodology: each AP uses local instantaneous channel info + global channel statistics (approximating other APs' instantaneous terms). Extend to precoding via uplink-downlink duality.

Result: GSLI-MMSE achieves performance comparable to optimal centralized MMSE under stable LoS conditions (static users with Rician fading and fixed LoS path). Tested over three channel models: correlated Rician with fixed/random LoS phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh.

Conclusion: GSLI-MMSE provides practical distributed beamforming solution for cell-free massive MIMO with minimal information exchange, maintaining near-optimal performance especially in stable LoS environments.

Abstract: We study a distributed beamforming approach for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, referred to as Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based minimum mean-square error (GSLI-MMSE). The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path.

*Rien Sonck,Bernd Accou,Tom Francart,Jonas Vanthornhout*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Multi-decoder EEG method predicts speech reception thresholds with high accuracy (r=0.647), achieving <1 dB differences comparable to behavioral tests, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based methods for predicting speech intelligibility lack the accuracy and robustness of behavioral tests (which show <1 dB test-retest differences). There's a need for objective assessment methods for populations who cannot perform behavioral tests, such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting.

Method: Multi-decoder approach aggregates data from hundreds of decoders trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking of speech. Recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person from 39 participants listening to speech at six SNR levels and a quiet story. Neural tracking values combined into high-dimensional feature vectors, with support vector regression trained to predict speech reception thresholds.

Result: Significant correlation between predicted and behavioral SRTs (r=0.647, p<0.001; NRMSE=0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis revealed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes story + 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The multi-decoder EEG method provides accurate and robust prediction of speech reception thresholds comparable to behavioral tests, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral testing. The approach reduces data collection requirements while maintaining accuracy, making it practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Objective: EEG-based methods can predict speech intelligibility, but their accuracy and robustness lag behind behavioral tests, which typically show test-retest differences under 1 dB. We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy.

*Metehan Karatas,Subhrakanti Dey,Christian Rohner,Jose Mairton Barros da Silva*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: VR-VFL is a federated learning method for vehicular networks that uses dynamic client selection and adaptive transmission rates to handle mobility and imperfect channel conditions, achieving 40% faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods for vehicular networks oversimplify real-world challenges like high vehicle mobility and imperfect channel state information, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal conditions, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, allowing flexible round times based on wireless conditions. It uses a bi-objective optimization framework that balances learning convergence improvement with minimizing round completion time.

Result: Simulation results show VR-VFL achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other existing methods in the literature.

Conclusion: VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks by addressing both mobility challenges and realistic wireless constraints through its adaptive, optimization-based framework.

Abstract: Federated learning in vehicular edge networks faces major challenges in efficient resource allocation, largely due to high vehicle mobility and the presence of imperfect channel state information. Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature.

### [252] [A Narrowband Fully-Analog Multi-Antenna Transmitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03718)
*Nikola Zlatanov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A fully-analog N-antenna transmitter using passive interferometric network with phase-control elements to synthesize arbitrary complex excitation vectors from a single RF tone, achieving power savings vs. digital arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a fully-analog alternative to fully-digital N-antenna transmitters that can synthesize arbitrary complex excitation vectors while reducing RF-front-end power consumption, particularly for applications where digital arrays are power-intensive.

Method: Uses a passive interferometric programmable network excited through one input port with N-1 impedance-matched ports. Employs a unitary state-preparation approach with binary magnitude-splitting tree for per-antenna magnitude allocation and per-antenna output phase bank for target phases. Uses 2N-1 real tunable degrees of freedom with deterministic O(N) programming.

Result: The architecture successfully synthesizes arbitrary complex excitation vectors with prescribed total power. For N≤16, modeling with COTS components shows significant RF-front-end power savings compared to equivalent fully-digital arrays.

Conclusion: The paper presents a proof-of-concept for narrowband fully-analog transmitters that can emulate digital functionality with reduced power consumption, using only phase-control elements in a passive network without dissipative amplitude control.

Abstract: This paper proposes a narrowband fully-analog $N$-antenna transmitter that emulates the functionality of a narrowband fully-digital $N$-antenna transmitter. Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\bm x[m]\in\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\|\bm x[m]\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control.
  The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\bm V(\bm\varphi)\bm e_1=\bm c$, where $\bm c=\bm x/\sqrt{P}$ and $\|\bm c\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed.
  Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture.
  The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DT-enabled two-stage framework combines physics-based beam modeling with DRL for real-time UAV-BS-beam association in aerial corridors, achieving 44-121% improvement over DQN and 249-807% gain over heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint BS association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors faces challenges: high-dimensional action spaces, CSI overhead, rapidly varying channels, and latency requirements. Conventional optimization is computationally prohibitive, while learning approaches need extensive site-specific datasets.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Build channel twin using ray-tracing with geo-spatial contexts to capture propagation characteristics, precompute optimal beam directions via dual annealing. 2) Train Multi-Head PPO agent on DT-generated channel data to map channel/beam states to joint UAV-BS-beam association decisions.

Result: PPO agent achieves 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic optimization in dense UAV scenarios, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to site-specific deployments, suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

Abstract: Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO) to improve efficiency and stability over conventional Newton-Schulz iteration by consolidating iterative structure, removing insignificant polynomial terms, and using learnable coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Newton-Schulz iteration suffers from inefficiency and instability. Existing improvements still follow the conventional iterative paradigm, which increases computation burden due to repeated matrix products along long dimensions.

Method: Consolidates iterative structure into unified framework (UNSO), avoids polynomial expansion, evaluates role of each matrix power, removes insignificant terms, and provides recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients that are optimized.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance with stable convergence. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: UNSO provides an efficient and stable alternative to conventional Newton-Schulz iteration by unifying the iterative structure and using optimized learnable coefficients.

Abstract: The Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration has gained increasing interest for its role in the Muon optimizer and the Stiefel manifold. However, the conventional NS iteration suffers from inefficiency and instability. Although various improvements have been introduced to NS iteration, they fail to deviate from the conventional iterative paradigm, which could increase computation burden largely due to the matrix products along the long dimension repeatedly. To address this, we consolidate the iterative structure into a unified framework, named Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO). To do so, we could avoid a polynomial expansion. Instead, we evaluate the role of each matrix power, remove the insignificant terms, and provide a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients. These learnable coefficients are then optimized, and achieve an outstanding performance with stable convergence. The code of our method is available: https://github.com/greekinRoma/Unified_Newton_Schulz_Orthogonalization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models combined with LLMs as data labelers and fallback mechanisms to improve cybersecurity AI models' reliability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training AI models in cybersecurity faces challenges like data drift and scarcity of labeled data, leading to frequent model updates and overfitting risks. There's a need for more reliable and robust models for real-world cybersecurity applications.

Method: 1) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (compacters with layer freezing strategies) for pre-trained language models. 2) Two LLM-based strategies: using LLMs as data-labeling tools for unlabeled data, and as fallback mechanisms for low-confidence predictions.

Result: Comprehensive experimental analysis on cybersecurity downstream tasks shows that combining parameter-efficient pre-trained models with LLMs improves model reliability and robustness for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The integration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques with LLM-based strategies (data labeling and fallback mechanisms) makes cybersecurity AI models more suitable for practical deployment by addressing data drift and label scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Training AI models in cybersecurity with help of vast datasets offers significant opportunities to mimic real-world behaviors effectively. However, challenges like data drift and scarcity of labelled data lead to frequent updates of models and the risk of overfitting. To address these challenges, we used parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained language models wherein we combine compacters with various layer freezing strategies. To enhance the capabilities of these pre-trained language models, in this work we introduce two strategies that use large language models. In the first strategy, we utilize large language models as data-labelling tools wherein they generate labels for unlabeled data. In the second strategy, large language modes are utilized as fallback mechanisms for predictions having low confidence scores. We perform comprehensive experimental analysis on the proposed strategies on different downstream tasks specific to cybersecurity domain. We empirically demonstrate that by combining parameter-efficient pre-trained models with large language models, we can improve the reliability and robustness of models, making them more suitable for real-world cybersecurity applications.

### [256] [Sparse Adapter Fusion for Continual Learning in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02502)
*Min Zeng,Xi Chen,Haiqin Yang,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFM is a sparse adapter fusion method for continual learning that dynamically reuses or adds adapters to minimize parameters while preventing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods face inefficient parameter reuse across tasks (risking forgetting on dissimilar tasks) and unnecessary new parameters for each task (hindering knowledge sharing).

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Decision stage determines whether to add new adapter, reuse existing one, or add empty adapter via architecture search prioritizing reuse; 2) Tuning stage uses layer-wise loss to differentiate adapters and capture task knowledge.

Result: SAFM outperforms SOTA methods, achieving comparable performance while using less than 60% of parameters.

Conclusion: SAFM effectively addresses parameter efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning through dynamic adapter fusion and reuse strategies.

Abstract: Continual learning in natural language processing plays a crucial role in adapting to evolving data and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.

*Xinyao Li,Hangwei Qian,Jingjing Li,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORDER is a multimodal pretraining framework that uses ordinality as a core principle for representing composite materials, addressing challenges of continuous design spaces and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches work well for materials with discrete graph representations (crystals, polymers) but fail for composites which have continuous, nonlinear design spaces without clear graph structures. Existing multimodal frameworks assume discrete, unique graph-property mappings and abundant data, which doesn't apply to composites with extreme data scarcity.

Method: ORDER (ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment) establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. It ensures materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in latent space, preserving the continuous nature of composite properties and enabling meaningful interpolation between sparse designs.

Result: ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks on both a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated carbon fiber T700 dataset with diverse fiber distributions.

Conclusion: The ordinality principle is effective for representing composite materials in multimodal learning, addressing the challenges of continuous design spaces and data scarcity that existing graph-based approaches cannot handle.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.

Motivation: Predicting length of stay after elective spine surgery is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and hospital resource utilization, but there's a need to synthesize current computational methods and their performance.

Method: PRISMA-guided systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library (2015-2024). Included studies applying statistical or machine learning models to predict length of stay for elective spine surgery patients. Three independent reviewers screened 1,263 studies and extracted data.

Result: 29 studies met inclusion criteria.

K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes also performed well. Common predictors: age, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), BMI, surgery type/duration, spinal levels. However, external validation and reporting practices varied widely.

Conclusion: Machine learning models show strong potential for length of stay prediction in elective spine surgery, but lack of standardization and external validation limits clinical utility. Future studies need standardized outcome definitions and transparent reporting for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: GraphDancer: RL framework that teaches LLMs to navigate heterogeneous knowledge graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution, using a graph-aware curriculum for effective training on moderate-sized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world knowledge sources are often organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text, posing challenges for LLMs: (1) navigating structured relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions needs multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking.

Method: Proposes GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. Introduces a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler.

Result: Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini on multi-domain benchmarks. Shows robust cross-domain generalization when trained on one domain and tested on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types.

Conclusion: GraphDancer demonstrates that RL with structured curriculum learning can effectively teach moderate-sized LLMs to navigate heterogeneous knowledge graphs, achieving strong performance and cross-domain generalization without requiring massive model sizes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to improve factuality, yet many real-world knowledge sources are organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text. Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills.

*Terence D Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDPA can be reformulated as projecting input vectors onto a context-dependent surface, revealing nonlinear dependencies and enabling faster computation and extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between SDPA's database-inspired "query, key, value" framework and mathematical signal processing, providing a more rigorous foundation for understanding SDPA's effectiveness in time-series applications.

Method: The authors mathematically rewrite SDPA in an equivalent form that represents it as a projection of input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves, revealing time-dependent contextual dependencies.

Result: The reformulation shows SDPA discovers nonlinear, time-dependent dependencies in input data, enables faster feedforward and learning algorithms, and suggests potential extensions to the method.

Conclusion: SDPA should be understood as finding time-dependent contextual meaning through surface projection rather than "self-attention," providing strong justification for its use in time-series data with local nonlinear dependencies.

Abstract: Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.

### [262] [TabularMath: Evaluating Computational Extrapolation in Tabular Learning via Program-Verified Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02523)
*Zerui Cheng,Jiashuo Liu,Jianzhu Yao,Pramod Viswanath,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabularMath benchmark evaluates tabular models' ability to extrapolate deterministic computations beyond statistical interpolation, revealing TabPFN v2.5 excels at smooth approximations while in-context learning better captures exact computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular benchmarks focus on statistical interpolation within data manifolds, but many high-value applications (financial modeling, physical simulations) involve deterministic computational processes. The paper investigates whether tabular models can extend from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation.

Method: Proposes TabularMath benchmark with 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. Evaluates 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning with GPT-OSS-120B using both standard regression metrics (R²) and rounded consistency (exact integer match).

Result: TabPFN v2.5 achieves R²=0.998 in-distribution and maintains positive R² under distribution shift, but drops below 10% exact-match accuracy on out-of-distribution data. In-context learning maintains around 40% exact-match accuracy, showing complementary strengths: TabPFN scales efficiently with data while ICL achieves exact computation from few examples.

Conclusion: Tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms (traditional tabular models and in-context learning) are complementary, suggesting different approaches are needed for statistical interpolation versus computational extrapolation tasks.

Abstract: Standard tabular benchmarks mainly focus on the evaluation of a model's capability to interpolate values inside a data manifold, where models good at performing local statistical smoothing are rewarded. However, there exists a very large category of high-value tabular data, including financial modeling and physical simulations, which are generated based upon deterministic computational processes, as opposed to stochastic and noisy relationships. Therefore, we investigate if tabular models can provide an extension from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation.
  We propose TabularMath, a diagnostic benchmark of 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. We evaluate 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-OSS-120B. On standard regression metrics, TabPFN v2.5 performs remarkably well, achieving R^2=0.998 in-distribution and maintaining positive R^2 even under distribution shift, which is unique among the tabular models we tested. When we measure rounded consistency (exact integer match), a different picture emerges: TabPFN v2.5 drops below 10% on out-of-distribution data, while ICL maintains around 40%. This gap between R^2 and exact-match accuracy suggests that tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms appear complementary: TabPFN scales efficiently with data; ICL achieves exact computation from few examples. We release all code and data to support further investigation.

### [263] [The "Robert Boulton" Singularity: Semantic Tunneling and Manifold Unfolding in Recursive AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02526)
*Pengyue Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPL is unreliable for monitoring AI stability; models can maintain low perplexity while catastrophically losing semantic diversity to converge on single narrative attractors. MNCIS framework prevents this by inducing manifold unfolding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perplexity (PPL) is conventionally used to monitor generative AI stability when trained on recursive synthetic data, but it fails to detect semantic collapse where models maintain grammatical fluency while losing semantic diversity.

Method: Used sliding-window protocol (N=1500) to identify "Semantic Tunneling" failure mode. Applied Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework with Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) as topological operator to induce "Manifold Unfolding."

Result: Baseline model converged to "Robert Boulton" Singularity within 7 generations despite maintaining low PPL (~83.9), with catastrophic loss of semantic diversity and latent manifold collapse (Global Effective Rank 3.62→2.22). MNCIS expanded effective rank to 5.35, preventing semantic collapse.

Conclusion: PPL is deceptive for monitoring AI stability in context-stabilized regimes. MNCIS framework successfully prevents semantic collapse by actively unfolding the latent manifold, preserving semantic diversity and resisting narrative attractors.

Abstract: The stability of generative artificial intelligence trained on recursive synthetic data is conventionally monitored via Perplexity (PPL). We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed "Semantic Tunneling." While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the "Robert Boulton" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces "Manifold Unfolding." MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an "Artificial Manifold" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.

*Lixiang Fan,Bohao Li,Tao Zou,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IGSTGNN is a novel framework that incorporates transportation incidents as external disturbances to improve traffic flow prediction accuracy, addressing the limitation of existing methods that ignore incident impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic forecasting methods focus only on historical spatio-temporal patterns but ignore the significant impact of sudden transportation incidents (accidents, adverse weather) that substantially alter traffic patterns. The unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to capture their effects from historical data alone.

Method: Proposes Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN) with two core components: 1) Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture initial heterogeneous spatial influence of incidents, and 2) Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model dynamic dissipation of incident effects over time.

Result: IGSTGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on a newly constructed large-scale dataset featuring time-aligned incident records with traffic time series. The ICSF and TIID modules demonstrate generalizability when integrated into various existing models.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling incident impacts through specialized spatial and temporal modules significantly improves traffic flow prediction accuracy, and the released dataset facilitates further research on incident-aware traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.

*Saurav Singh,Rodney Sanchez,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL framework using off-policy evaluation (OPE) to automate state space and reward function selection from logged data, eliminating need for real-time environment access or human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL requires extensive human expertise and real-time environment interaction, which is costly and impractical for complex, safety-critical applications like human-robot interaction. There's a need to reduce dependency on costly real-time interactions and human involvement.

Method: Proposes an RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection using only logged interaction data. Systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance.

Result: Validated on two environments: OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander (controlled setting) and NASA-MATB-II human subjects study (real-world human-robot teaming scenarios). The approach successfully automates critical RL design decisions through data-driven OPE-based evaluation.

Conclusion: Enhances feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to transform real-world decision-making systems by enabling autonomous agents to learn from experience. Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.

*Jingyi Xu,Shengnan Wang,Weidong Yang,Siwei Tu,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IceBench-S2S is a new benchmark for evaluating deep learning approaches to extend Arctic sea ice concentration forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (180-day) scales, addressing limitations of current DL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning sea ice forecasting models are limited to daily subseasonal scales and monthly averages up to 6 months, which hinders real-world applications like Arctic transportation planning. There's a critical need to extend daily forecasts to seasonal (S2S) scales for operational use.

Method: IceBench-S2S proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space, then models temporally concatenated deep features using DL-based forecasting backbones to predict sea ice variation at S2S scale (180-day periods).

Result: The paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark (IceBench-S2S) for evaluating DL approaches in forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration over successive 180-day periods, providing a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones.

Conclusion: IceBench-S2S bridges the gap between current DL model forecasting lead times and the needed daily S2S scale, offering practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks and enabling better operational applications.

Abstract: Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate system, significantly influencing polar ecological stability and human activities in coastal regions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.

*Trishit Mondal,Ameya D. Jagtap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRL-based active flow control stabilizes hypersonic inlet unstart at Mach 5, showing robust performance across varying conditions with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypersonic unstart phenomenon challenges reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5+ due to shock-boundary-layer interactions and pressure fluctuations that destabilize inlet operation.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning controller with high-fidelity CFD simulations using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation for physically consistent control policies.

Result: DRL controller robustly stabilizes inlet across wide back-pressure ranges, generalizes to unseen scenarios (different pressures, Reynolds numbers, sensor configurations), works with noisy measurements, and achieves comparable performance with minimal sensor set.

Conclusion: Establishes data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties, enabling practical implementation for hypersonic propulsion systems.

Abstract: The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.

*Mahyar Alinejad,Yue Wang,George Atia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CADENT is a transfer learning framework for RL that combines strategic automaton knowledge with tactical policy guidance using an experience-gated trust mechanism for adaptive domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transfer learning methods struggle with domain shift: policy distillation lacks long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods lack fine-grained action guidance. There's a need to unify both strategic and tactical knowledge for effective RL transfer learning.

Method: CADENT combines strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. It uses an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics.

Result: Across challenging environments (sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks), CADENT achieves 40-60% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance.

Conclusion: CADENT establishes a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL by effectively unifying strategic and tactical knowledge with dynamic trust mechanisms for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Transfer learning promises to reduce the high sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet existing methods struggle with domain shift between source and target environments. Policy distillation provides powerful tactical guidance but fails to transfer long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods capture task structure but lack fine-grained action guidance. This paper introduces Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT), a framework that unifies strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. CADENT's key innovation is an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics. Across challenging environments, from sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks, CADENT achieves 40-60\% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance, establishing a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL.

*Yixuan Zhang,Zhiyuan Li,Weijia He,Mian Dai,Chen Shen,Teng Long,Hongbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that treats optimization as trajectory discovery rather than full response surface approximation, achieving efficient discovery in high-dimensional design spaces with limited evaluation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each evaluation (experimental or simulation) is costly, requiring methods that work under limited evaluation budgets.

Method: Information-theoretic framework that maintains low-entropy information state, uses dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance exploitation and exploration.

Result: Improves sample efficiency across 14 materials design tasks (candidate pools from 600 to 4×10^6, features from 10 to 10^3 dimensions), reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Also robust on 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel).

Conclusion: The framework successfully reframes optimization as trajectory discovery, enabling efficient target-oriented adaptive sampling in high-dimensional spaces with limited evaluation budgets through information-theoretic principles and multi-model fusion.

Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.

TL;DR: HyExDNN-RNN model achieves 99% F1 score for ADHD binary classification and 94.2% for multi-class categorization with explainable AI features for clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADHD diagnosis is challenging and requires reliable, transparent approaches. Current methods lack interpretability, making it difficult for psychologists to trust AI-based diagnostic results.

Method: Proposed HyExDNN-RNN framework combines fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network. Uses Pearson correlation for feature selection, SHAP and PFI for explainability, and standardized techniques for feature reduction and model interpretation.

Result: Achieved 99% F1 score on binary ADHD classification and 94.2% on multi-class categorization. XAI approaches provided insights into feature importance and model decision logic.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges AI with clinical psychology by providing accurate ADHD detection with interpretable results, enabling psychologists to understand and trust AI-assisted diagnoses.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is challenging to diagnose and requires advanced approaches for reliable and transparent identification and classification. It is characterized by a pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that is more severe and more frequent than in individuals with a comparable level of development. In this paper, an explainable framework based on a fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called HyExDNN-RNN model is proposed for ADHD detection, multi-class categorization, and decision interpretation. This framework not only detects ADHD, but also provides interpretable insights into the diagnostic process so that psychologists can better understand and trust the results of the diagnosis. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient for optimal feature selection and machine and deep learning models for experimental analysis and comparison. We use a standardized technique for feature reduction, model selection and interpretation to accurately determine the diagnosis rate and ensure the interpretability of the proposed framework. Our framework provided excellent results on binary classification, with HyExDNN-RNN achieving an F1 score of 99% and 94.2% on multi-class categorization. XAI approaches, in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), provided important insights into the importance of features and the decision logic of models. By combining AI with human expertise, we aim to bridge the gap between advanced computational techniques and practical psychological applications. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to assist in ADHD diagnosis and interpretation.

TL;DR: UniMod introduces a novel multimodal safety moderation paradigm that replaces binary labels with dense reasoning traces to prevent shortcut learning, achieving competitive performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal safety moderation suffers from data and supervision sparsity, leading to shortcut learning where models rely on superficial patterns rather than understanding intrinsic classification boundaries for effective discrimination.

Method: Proposes UniMod with structured reasoning trajectories (evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, response generation) and a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM) for multi-dimensional supervision. Uses specialized optimization strategies to decouple task parameters and balance training dynamics.

Result: UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets new multimodal benchmarks using less than 40% of training data compared to leading baselines. Ablations validate the effectiveness of multi-attribute trajectory reasoning.

Conclusion: The dense reasoning paradigm provides an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation by forcing models to ground decisions in explicit safety semantics rather than superficial shortcuts.

Abstract: Safety moderation is pivotal for identifying harmful content. Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

*Zheqi Lv,Zhenxuan Fan,Qi Tian,Wenqiao Zhang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAQ (Future-Aware Quantization) improves LLM compression by using future-layer activations to guide quantization, reducing bias and error accumulation from calibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PTQ suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, especially with biased calibration data, leading to suboptimal and unstable quantization results.

Method: FAQ leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization, uses window-wise preview to aggregate multiple future layers, and employs pre-searched configurations to avoid expensive search.

Result: FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requires no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it suitable for edge deployment.

Conclusion: Future-aware quantization effectively addresses PTQ limitations by incorporating future-layer information, providing stable and high-quality compression for LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used method to compress large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It typically sets quantization hyperparameters (e.g., scaling factors) based on current-layer activations. Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment.

TL;DR: Vision-centric models for text encoding face information capacity limits, showing phase transitions from stable to collapse as visual density increases, with a unified scaling law for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fundamental information upper bound of visual tokens in vision-centric models like DeepSeek-OCR, which encode rendered text into vision tokens with high compression but unknown capacity limits.

Method: Conducted controlled stress tests by progressively increasing character count in images, observed phase-transition phenomena, analyzed mechanical origins, and formulated a probabilistic scaling law unifying vision token load and visual density.

Result: Identified three distinct regimes: Stable Phase (near-perfect), Instability Phase (increased error variance), and Collapse Phase. Developed a scaling law that demonstrates universality across various Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: The scaling law provides critical empirical guidance for optimizing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs in visual context compression, revealing fundamental limits of vision token information capacity.

Abstract: Recent vision-centric approaches have made significant strides in long-context modeling. Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase. We analyze the mechanical origins of these transitions and identify key factors. Furthermore, we formulate a probabilistic scaling law that unifies average vision token load and visual density into a latent difficulty metric. Extensive experiments across various Vision-Language Models demonstrate the universality of this scaling law, providing critical empirical guidance for optimizing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in visual context compression.

TL;DR: AutoCL: An end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning method for wearable-based human activity recognition that reduces manual augmentation burden by learning optimal augmentations automatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning for HAR requires manual data augmentation which lacks generalizability and flexibility. Current methods rely on manual attempts for augmentation strategies in pretext tasks, creating a burden for low-semantic sensor signals.

Method: Proposes AutoCL with Siamese network architecture sharing backbone parameters, embedded generator for auto-augmentation learning, stop-gradient design, and correlation reduction strategy. Generator learns augmentations based on latent space representations to handle noise and redundant information in raw sensor data.

Result: Extensive experiments on four widely-used HAR datasets demonstrate that AutoCL significantly improves recognition accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AutoCL effectively reduces the augmentation burden in contrastive learning for HAR by automatically learning optimal augmentations, leading to improved performance and greater flexibility compared to manual augmentation approaches.

Abstract: For low-semantic sensor signals from human activity recognition (HAR), contrastive learning (CL) is essential to implement novel applications or generic models without manual annotation, which is a high-performance self-supervised learning (SSL) method. However, CL relies heavily on data augmentation for pairwise comparisons. Especially for low semantic data in the HAR area, conducting good performance augmentation strategies in pretext tasks still rely on manual attempts lacking generalizability and flexibility. To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design. Furthermore, we propose a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy in AutoCL to enhance encoder representation learning. Extensive experiments based on four wide-used HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed AutoCL method significantly improves recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.

Method: Proposes a sheaf-theoretic framework where SCMs are Gaussian, restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions, and edge stalks correspond to node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Formulates the problem as edge-specific local Riemannian problems and introduces SPECTRAL, an iterative method with closed-form updates suitable for positive (semi)definite covariance matrices.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in causal abstraction learning tasks and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient approach to learning consistent causal abstraction networks using sheaf theory and specialized optimization methods, advancing causal AI's explainability and robustness goals.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we tackle the learning of consistent causal abstraction network (CAN), a sheaf-theoretic framework where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs) adhering to the semantic embedding principle, and (iii) edge stalks correspond--up to permutation--to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Mingda Liu,Zhenghan Zhu,Ze'an Miao,Katsuki Fujisawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Norm-Anchor Scaling (NAS), a simple plug-and-play method to prevent model collapse in Locate-and-Edit model editing by constraining MLP weight norm growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Locate-and-Edit (L&E) methods for updating LLMs suffer from abrupt model collapse after multiple sequential edits, which is correlated with explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms.

Method: Proposes Norm-Anchor Scaling (NAS), a norm-constrained strategy that adds minimal code to existing L&E algorithms to control weight norm growth during sequential edits.

Result: NAS delays collapse point by 4+ times, achieves 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, with negligible computational overhead and just one additional line of code.

Conclusion: NAS effectively addresses the norm explosion problem in sequential model editing, providing a simple yet powerful solution to prevent model collapse in L&E methods.

Abstract: Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.

*Wenhao Sun,Rong-Cheng Tu,Yifu Ding,Zhao Jin,Jingyi Liao,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPA-Cache improves DLM efficiency by optimizing cache updates with low-dimensional token identification and adaptive budget allocation, achieving 8x throughput over vanilla decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) lack standard KV caching due to their non-causal nature, forcing costly hidden state recomputation at every decoding step. Existing caching approaches have limitations: expensive token-wise update identification heuristics and rigid, uniform budget allocation that doesn't account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics.

Method: SPA-Cache jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation. 1) Uses a low-dimensional singular proxy to identify update-critical tokens in a subspace, reducing identification overhead. 2) Introduces adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality.

Result: Significantly improves DLM efficiency, yielding up to 8× throughput improvement over vanilla decoding and 2-4× speedup over existing caching baselines.

Conclusion: SPA-Cache effectively addresses the caching challenges in DLMs through optimized update identification and adaptive budget allocation, substantially improving inference efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: While Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a flexible, arbitrary-order alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, their non-causal nature precludes standard KV caching, forcing costly hidden state recomputation at every decoding step. Existing DLM caching approaches reduce this cost by selective hidden state updates; however, they are still limited by (i) costly token-wise update identification heuristics and (ii) rigid, uniform budget allocation that fails to account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality. Together, these contributions significantly improve the efficiency of DLMs, yielding up to an $8\times$ throughput improvement over vanilla decoding and a $2$--$4\times$ speedup over existing caching baselines.

TL;DR: Automated dysphagia detection using portable acoustic sensing and machine learning achieves 0.904 AUC-ROC for abnormality detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dysphagia diagnostic methods rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures, creating a need for noninvasive, accessible alternatives for early detection of swallowing abnormalities.

Method: Portable, noninvasive acoustic sensing captures subtle neck signals during swallowing tasks, combined with applied machine learning to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions.

Result: Promising test-time abnormality detection performance with AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits, demonstrating effective detection capability.

Conclusion: Noninvasive acoustic sensing is a feasible, practical, and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring, offering an alternative to current invasive diagnostic methods.

Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.

TL;DR: MRPO introduces a geometric framework to expand LLMs' reasoning capacity beyond pre-trained bias manifolds through spectral orthogonal exploration and effective rank regularization, achieving SOTA math performance with 4B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the hypothesis that RL merely aligns existing latent capabilities rather than expanding reasoning capacity, addressing the limitation that exploration remains confined within pre-trained models' low-rank bias manifolds.

Method: Two-stage Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization: 1) Spectral Orthogonal Exploration to eject policy initialization into the null space of bias manifold, 2) Effective Rank regularization in policy optimization objective to incentivize high-dimensional reasoning trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks with 4B parameters, significantly outperforming larger models like Qwen3-32B and expanding capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions, challenging the accessibility boundary hypothesis and showing RL can genuinely expand reasoning capacity beyond alignment of existing capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

TL;DR: VLM-FS-EB: A function-space empirical Bayes framework using vision-language models to generate semantic context points for expressive priors in Bayesian deep learning, improving uncertainty quantification and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian deep learning needs informative priors that scale to high dimensions. Existing functional VI methods use GP priors with limited expressiveness in high-dimensional regimes. There's a need for more expressive functional priors that can handle complex, high-dimensional data.

Method: VLM-FS-EB leverages large vision-language models to generate semantically meaningful synthetic context points. These samples are embedded using VLMs to construct expressive functional priors in a function-space empirical Bayes regularization framework.

Result: The method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates compared to various baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: Using vision-language models to generate semantic context points enables construction of more expressive functional priors, addressing limitations of GP priors in high-dimensional Bayesian deep learning and improving uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification by combining deep neural networks with Bayesian inference. A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D²Quant is a weight-only post-training quantization framework for LLMs that improves sub-4-bit accuracy through dual-scale quantization for down-projection matrices and deviation-aware correction for activation shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high compute/memory costs making deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only PTQ is appealing but suffers from significant accuracy degradation at sub-4-bit precision due to down-projection matrix bottlenecks and activation deviations from weight quantization.

Method: Proposes D²Quant with two key components: 1) Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) for down-projection matrices with absorbable scaling factor that improves accuracy without increasing bit budget, and 2) Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC) that incorporates mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show D²Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: D²Quant effectively addresses key bottlenecks in weight-only PTQ for LLMs, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios through improved quantization accuracy at sub-4-bit precision without requiring specialized hardware or low-bit operators.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance, but their high compute and memory costs make deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision.

TL;DR: naPINN is a robust Physics-Informed Neural Network that adaptively filters outliers and handles complex noise without prior knowledge of noise distribution, outperforming existing methods on corrupted PDE data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs degrade significantly under complex measurement noise and gross outliers, limiting their practical application to real-world observational data with corruption.

Method: naPINN embeds an energy-based model to learn latent distribution of prediction residuals, uses a trainable reliability gate to adaptively filter high-energy data points, and incorporates rejection cost regularization to prevent trivial solutions.

Result: naPINN significantly outperforms existing robust PINN baselines, successfully isolates outliers, and accurately reconstructs dynamics under severe data corruption across various benchmark PDEs with non-Gaussian noise and varying outlier rates.

Conclusion: The proposed naPINN provides an effective solution for robust physics discovery from corrupted measurements without requiring prior knowledge of noise distribution, enhancing the practical applicability of PINNs to real-world observational data.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective methods for solving inverse problems and discovering governing equations from observational data. However, their performance degrades significantly under complex measurement noise and gross outliers. To address this issue, we propose the Noise-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (naPINN), which robustly recovers physical solutions from corrupted measurements without prior knowledge of the noise distribution. naPINN embeds an energy-based model into the training loop to learn the latent distribution of prediction residuals. Leveraging the learned energy landscape, a trainable reliability gate adaptively filters data points exhibiting high energy, while a rejection cost regularization prevents trivial solutions where valid data are discarded. We demonstrate the efficacy of naPINN on various benchmark partial differential equations corrupted by non-Gaussian noise and varying rates of outliers. The results show that naPINN significantly outperforms existing robust PINN baselines, successfully isolating outliers and accurately reconstructing the dynamics under severe data corruption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent models have limitations: coordinate-based approaches struggle with varying input resolutions/aspect ratios, while coordinate-free alternatives suffer from severe data scarcity during learning.

Method: Proposes ToolTok with three key components: 1) Multi-step pathfinding with progressive tool usage, 2) Semantic anchoring mechanism to ground tools with related concepts as inductive bias, 3) Easy-to-hard curriculum training with three tasks (token definition QA, text-guided tool selection, simplified visual pathfinding).

Result: Achieves superior performance among 4B-scale models and remains competitive with 235B models, using less than 1% of training data required by other approaches. Shows strong generalization across unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: ToolTok demonstrates an effective paradigm for GUI agents that addresses data scarcity and generalization issues through semantic anchoring and curriculum learning, achieving strong performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Existing GUI agent models relying on coordinate-based one-step visual grounding struggle with generalizing to varying input resolutions and aspect ratios. Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios. Our training & inference code is open-source at https://github.com/ZephinueCode/ToolTok.

TL;DR: HyPAC is a method that routes data annotation tasks to the most cost-efficient source (LLMs, reasoning models, or humans) while providing statistical guarantees on annotation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data annotation involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, creating a need for intelligent routing to minimize costs while maintaining annotation quality.

Method: HyPAC uses importance sampling and upper confidence bounds to calibrate decision thresholds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to appropriate annotation sources.

Result: Experiments show HyPAC reduces annotation cost by 78.51% while tightly controlling annotation error, achieving minimum expected cost with PAC guarantees.

Conclusion: HyPAC provides a practical solution for cost-efficient data annotation with distribution-free statistical guarantees, making it suitable for real-world annotation pipelines.

Abstract: Data annotation often involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, such as fast large language models (LLMs), slow reasoning models, and human experts. In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.

Motivation: Transformer-based models suffer from error accumulation in multivariate long-sequence prediction and vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples in image tasks.

Conclusion: The method shows potential as a versatile cross-task foundation model for Web-scale data mining and analysis, effectively addressing key limitations of current Transformer models in handling complex Web data.

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as time-series forecasting and image segmentation. However, they frequently suffer from error accumulation in multivariate long-sequence prediction and exhibit vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples in image-related tasks. Furthermore, these challenges become particularly pronounced in large-scale Web data analysis tasks, which typically involve complex temporal patterns and multimodal features. This complexity substantially increases optimization difficulty, rendering models prone to stagnation at saddle points within high-dimensional parameter spaces. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Transformer architecture in conjunction with a novel Escape-Explore Optimizer (EEO). The optimizer enhances both exploration and generalization while effectively avoiding sharp minima and saddle-point traps. Experimental results show that, in representative Web data scenarios, our method achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art models across 11 time-series benchmark datasets and the Synapse medical image segmentation task. Moreover, it demonstrates superior generalization and stability, thereby validating its potential as a versatile cross-task foundation model for Web-scale data mining and analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality code-documentation pairs are expensive to create and scarce for niche programming languages, limiting LLM training for code-related tasks. There's a need for methods that can train effectively with only code data.

Method: BatCoder uses a back-translation strategy: generate documentation from code, then reconstruct the original code from that documentation. The semantic similarity between original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward for reinforcement learning, jointly improving both code generation and documentation production.

Result: On HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. The framework shows consistent scaling with both training corpus size and model capacity.

Conclusion: BatCoder enables effective training of code LLMs using only code data through self-supervised reinforcement learning, addressing data scarcity issues while achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating good scaling properties.

Abstract: Training LLMs for code-related tasks typically depends on high-quality code-documentation pairs, which are costly to curate and often scarce for niche programming languages. We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSN-RLVR introduces parameter-space noise to overcome exploration limitations in RLVR, enabling better discovery of new reasoning strategies rather than just reweighting existing ones, especially beneficial for large sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods have an exploration ceiling - they mainly reweight existing solution traces rather than discovering new reasoning strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256).

Method: PSN-RLVR perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation for temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration. It uses truncated importance sampling to mitigate sampling-update mismatch and a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by semantic diversity and normalized self-certainty.

Result: PSN-GRPO consistently expands effective reasoning capability boundaries across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods.

Conclusion: Parameter-space noise with adaptive scheduling and importance sampling correction effectively addresses RLVR's exploration limitations, enabling better discovery of novel reasoning strategies while remaining orthogonal and composable with other methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.

TL;DR: SEAM is a lightweight plug-in module that stores experiences in its parameters to guide frozen LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are static and repeat mistakes, while existing experience reuse methods rely on external retrieval that introduces noise and latency.

Method: SEAM stores experience in its parameters, generates structured experience entries in a single forward pass, and is trained via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the LLM frozen.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead.

Conclusion: SEAM provides an effective and robust approach to experience reuse that improves LLM performance without modifying the base model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are largely static and often redo reasoning or repeat mistakes. Prior experience reuse typically relies on external retrieval, which is similarity-based, can introduce noise, and adds latency. We introduce SEAM (Structured Experience Adapter Module), a lightweight, executor-specific plug-in that stores experience in its parameters and generates a structured, instance-tailored experience entry in a single forward pass to guide a frozen LLM executor. SEAM is trained for utility via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the executor frozen, and it can be further improved after deployment with supervised fine-tuning on logged successful trajectories. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead. Extensive ablations and analyses further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SEAM's effectiveness and robustness.

*Yupeng Chen,Junchi Yu,Aoxi Liu,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-audio jailbreak transfer works surprisingly well, often outperforming existing audio-based attacks, revealing an "alignment curse" where strong modality alignment propagates vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal models have advanced and audio jailbreaks exist, the transfer of textual jailbreaks to audio remains unexplored despite semantic similarity between modalities and mature textual attack methods.

Method: Analyze connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, then empirically evaluate textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models.

Result: Text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to or better than audio-based jailbreaks, show strong cross-model transferability, and remain effective even under stricter audio-only access threat models.

Conclusion: Text-transferred audio jailbreaks establish simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming, revealing the "alignment curse" where strong modality alignment inadvertently propagates vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.

*Zekang Yang,Hong Liu,Xiangdong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PA-MIL is an ante-hoc interpretable framework for pathology WSIs that identifies cancer-related phenotypes using a knowledge base and genotype-phenotype relationships for cancer subtyping with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deep learning methods for pathology WSIs only provide post-hoc interpretability through saliency maps, lacking reliable and accountable explanations. There's a need for ante-hoc interpretable frameworks that can identify meaningful cancer phenotypes and provide transparent reasoning.

Method: 1) Construct phenotype knowledge base with cancer-related phenotypes and associated genotypes. 2) Use morphological descriptions as language prompts to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) Develop Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) based on genotype-phenotype relationships to provide multi-level guidance for PA-MIL framework.

Result: PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. It leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and achieves competitive results with a linear classifier compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework enables thorough analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships and provides cohort-level and case-level interpretability.

Conclusion: PA-MIL demonstrates reliability and accountability in cancer subtyping from WSIs by providing ante-hoc interpretability through phenotype identification and genotype-phenotype relationship modeling, offering more transparent and trustworthy explanations than post-hoc methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively researched in the analysis of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). However, most existing methods are limited to providing prediction interpretability by locating the model's salient areas in a post-hoc manner, failing to offer more reliable and accountable explanations. In this work, we propose Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (PA-MIL), a novel ante-hoc interpretable framework that identifies cancer-related phenotypes from WSIs and utilizes them for cancer subtyping. To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as cohort-level and case-level interpretability, demonstrating the reliability and accountability of PA-MIL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S(H)NAP is a model-agnostic auditing framework that uses generative interventional attributions to causally verify Sybil, a deep learning model for lung cancer risk prediction from CT scans, revealing both expert-like behavior and critical failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessments of lung cancer screening models like Sybil rely on observational metrics that don't reveal actual reasoning mechanisms, creating a need for causal verification before clinical deployment to ensure robust decision-making.

Method: S(H)NAP uses realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, constructing generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists to isolate object-specific causal contributions to risk scores.

Result: The first interventional audit of Sybil shows it often behaves like expert radiologists in differentiating malignant from benign nodules, but has critical failure modes including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and distinct radial bias.

Conclusion: Causal verification through frameworks like S(H)NAP is essential for understanding model reasoning mechanisms and identifying failure modes before clinical deployment of AI screening tools, even for extensively validated models like Sybil.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, driving the development of automated screening tools to alleviate radiologist workload. Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.

*Jiaming Ma,Binwu Wang,Pengkun Wang,Xu Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLearner: A bidirectional learning framework that enhances spatiotemporal neural networks by incorporating label features during training to address spatiotemporal discrepancies between inputs and labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal prediction models use unidirectional learning from historical inputs to future labels, but perform poorly when there are discrepancies between inputs and labels (e.g., similar inputs leading to different future outcomes, or different inputs leading to similar outcomes).

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem to generalize unidirectional prediction into bidirectional learning. Designs ReLearner module with two components: Residual Learning Module to disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between inputs and labels, and Residual Smoothing Module to smooth residuals for stable convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models show ReLearner significantly enhances predictive performance of existing spatiotemporal neural networks.

Conclusion: ReLearner provides an effective bidirectional learning framework that addresses spatiotemporal discrepancies by incorporating label features during training, improving performance of spatiotemporal prediction models through residual learning.

Abstract: Prevailing spatiotemporal prediction models typically operate under a forward (unidirectional) learning paradigm, in which models extract spatiotemporal features from historical observation input and map them to target spatiotemporal space for future forecasting (label). However, these models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance when spatiotemporal discrepancies exist between inputs and labels, for instance, when nodes with similar time-series inputs manifest distinct future labels, or vice versa. To address this limitation, we propose explicitly incorporating label features during the training phase. Specifically, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem, which generalizes the conventional unidirectional spatiotemporal prediction paradigm into a bidirectional learning framework. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we design an universal module, termed ReLearner, which seamlessly augments Spatiotemporal Neural Networks (STNNs) with a bidirectional learning capability via an auxiliary inverse learning process. In this process, the model relearns the spatiotemporal feature residuals between input data and future data. The proposed ReLearner comprises two critical components: (1) a Residual Learning Module, designed to effectively disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between input and label representations; and (2) a Residual Smoothing Module, employed to smooth residual terms and facilitate stable convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models demonstrate that ReLearner significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing STNNs.Our code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AURA is an agentic AI framework that coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without ground truth, using probabilistic modeling to infer true labels and annotator reliability, achieving up to 5.8% accuracy improvement on benchmarks and up to 50% improvement with poor quality annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data annotation for supervised learning faces challenges with cost, speed, and annotator variability as datasets grow. Traditional human-centric pipelines are expensive, slow, and prone to inconsistency, creating need for reliability-aware automated annotation.

Method: AURA coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without ground truth. It adapts a classical probabilistic model that jointly infers latent true labels and annotator reliability via confusion matrices, using Expectation-Maximization to reconcile conflicting annotations and aggregate noisy predictions.

Result: Across four benchmark datasets, AURA achieves accuracy improvements of up to 5.8% over baseline. In challenging settings with poor quality annotators, improvement reaches up to 50% over baseline. AURA also accurately estimates annotator reliability without pre-validation steps.

Conclusion: AURA provides an effective agentic AI framework for scalable, multi-modal data annotation that improves accuracy while modeling annotator reliability, addressing limitations of traditional human-centric annotation pipelines.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential for supervised learning, yet producing accurate, unbiased, and scalable labels remains challenging as datasets grow in size and modality. Traditional human-centric pipelines are costly, slow, and prone to annotator variability, motivating reliability-aware automated annotation. We present AURA (Agentic AI for Unified Reliability Modeling and Annotation Aggregation), an agentic AI framework for large-scale, multi-modal data annotation. AURA coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without requiring ground truth. At its core, AURA adapts a classical probabilistic model that jointly infers latent true labels and annotator reliability via confusion matrices, using Expectation-Maximization to reconcile conflicting annotations and aggregate noisy predictions. Across the four benchmark datasets evaluated, AURA achieves accuracy improvements of up to 5.8% over baseline. In more challenging settings with poor quality annotators, the improvement is up to 50% over baseline. AURA also accurately estimates the reliability of annotators, allowing assessment of annotator quality even without any pre-validation steps.

*Huanran Li,Jeremy Johnson,Daniel Pimentel-Alarcón*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for high-rank matrix completion that clusters incomplete vectors using proxy subspaces and optimizes two Grassmannian criteria, achieving better performance especially at low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-rank matrix completion methods lack theoretical support, produce uninterpretable results, and require more samples than theoretically necessary, creating a gap between practical performance and theoretical limits.

Method: Clustering incomplete vectors by grouping proxy subspaces and minimizing two criteria over the Grassmannian: (1) chordal distance between each point and its corresponding subspace, and (2) geodesic distances between subspaces of all data points.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show comparable performance to leading methods at high sampling rates and significantly better performance at low sampling rates, narrowing the gap to the theoretical sampling limit.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of current HRMC approaches by providing a theoretically grounded, interpretable solution that performs well even with limited samples, bringing practical performance closer to theoretical bounds.

Abstract: This paper approaches high-rank matrix completion (HRMC) by filling missing entries in a data matrix where columns lie near a union of subspaces, clustering these columns, and identifying the underlying subspaces. Current methods often lack theoretical support, produce uninterpretable results, and require more samples than theoretically necessary. We propose clustering incomplete vectors by grouping proxy subspaces and minimizing two criteria over the Grassmannian: (a) the chordal distance between each point and its corresponding subspace and (b) the geodesic distances between subspaces of all data points. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to leading methods in high sampling rates and significantly better in low sampling rates, thus narrowing the gap to the theoretical sampling limit of HRMC.

*Samin Semsar,Kiran Laxmikant Prabhu,Gabriella Waters,James Foulds*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive policing systems show complex bias patterns - similar to traditional hot spots policing but with faster bias amplification, though sometimes favoring White neighborhoods in Baltimore unlike previous studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are concerns about racial bias in predictive policing systems due to feedback loops and historically biased training data, but comparative studies are limited and insufficiently comprehensive.

Method: Comprehensive comparative simulation study evaluating fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore, comparing them with traditional hot spots policing.

Result: Predictive policing exhibited bias from feedback loops as expected, but hot spots policing had similar issues. Predictive policing was more fair and accurate short-term but amplified bias faster long-term. In Baltimore, bias sometimes favored over-policing in White neighborhoods, contrary to previous studies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation of predictive policing systems, revealing complex bias patterns and long-term tendencies that differ from previous assumptions.

Abstract: There are ongoing discussions about predictive policing systems, such as those deployed in Los Angeles, California and Baltimore, Maryland, being unfair, for example, by exhibiting racial bias. Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation and behavioral-tendency comparison of predictive policing systems, showing how such simulations can reveal inequities and long-term tendencies.

TL;DR: HTCL is a hierarchical continual learning framework that uses Taylor series expansion with Hessian regularization to combine fast local adaptation with conservative global consolidation, reducing variance from random task ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high variance introduced by random task ordering in continual learning systems, which conventional single-level CL systems cannot handle effectively.

Method: Hierarchical framework with local adaptation and global consolidation using Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion; identifies optimal intra-group task sequences and extends to L-level hierarchy for multiscale knowledge integration.

Result: Consistently enhances performance across datasets and baselines with mean accuracy gains of 7% to 25% and reduces standard deviation of final accuracy by up to 68% across random task permutations.

Conclusion: HTCL provides a model-agnostic consolidation layer that effectively addresses task-order variance through hierarchical Taylor series-based continual learning with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Hierarchical Taylor Series-based Continual Learning (HTCL)}$, a framework that couples fast local adaptation with conservative, second-order global consolidation to address the high variance introduced by random task ordering. To address task-order effects, HTCL identifies the best intra-group task sequence and integrates the resulting local updates through a Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion, yielding a consolidation step with theoretical guarantees. The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\%$ to $25\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\%$ across random task permutations.

*Zhiqi Li,Yuchen Sun,Duowen Chen,Jinjin He,Bo Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMF is a flow-based generative framework for efficient one-step/few-step generation that replaces trajectory consistency constraints with a linear surrogate for better optimization and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based generative models struggle with trajectory consistency constraints over long time scales, which are difficult to supervise and optimize, leading to high computational costs and training instability.

Method: EMF replaces the difficult trajectory consistency constraint with a principled linear surrogate derived from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models. This enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions without explicit Jacobian computations (JVP-free).

Result: EMF demonstrates improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, with approximately 50% reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.

Conclusion: EMF provides a unified, efficient framework for flow-based generative modeling that addresses trajectory consistency challenges through principled linear approximation, enabling better performance with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reward model optimization method to address bias inheritance from base policies in LLM alignment, showing that simple reward shaping approximates optimal solutions and improves performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods using KL regularization with base policies can inherit biases that conflict with user preferences, creating a tradeoff between mitigating bias and avoiding reward hacking.

Method: Formalizes reward model optimization as a Stackelberg game, proposes a simple reward shaping scheme to approximate optimal reward models, and integrates it into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows consistent improvement in average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines across different evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed reward model optimization approach effectively addresses bias inheritance issues in LLM alignment while maintaining robustness against reward hacking, offering a practical enhancement to existing alignment methods.

Abstract: Existing alignment methods directly use the reward model learned from user preference data to optimize an LLM policy, subject to KL regularization with respect to the base policy. This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified algebraic framework for understanding and constructing neural network architectures, showing that various modern networks can be expressed through a common mathematical foundation.

Method: Develops product interactions formalism using multiplication operators over suitable algebras, organizing algebraic expressions by increasing interaction order (linear, quadratic, higher-order).

Result: Shows that convolutional/equivariant networks correspond to symmetry-constrained linear product interactions, while attention and Mamba correspond to higher-order product interactions.

Conclusion: Product interactions provide a principled algebraic framework that unifies diverse neural network architectures through a common construction based on interaction order and algebraic structure.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce product interactions, an algebraic formalism in which neural network layers are constructed from compositions of a multiplication operator defined over suitable algebras. Product interactions provide a principled way to generate and organize algebraic expressions by increasing interaction order. Our central observation is that algebraic expressions in modern neural networks admit a unified construction in terms of linear, quadratic, and higher-order product interactions. Convolutional and equivariant networks arise as symmetry-constrained linear product interactions, while attention and Mamba correspond to higher-order product interactions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuantLRM: A weight quantization method for Large Reasoning Models that uses fine-tuning weight update magnitudes to identify important weights, protecting both smallest and largest updates for better quantization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight-only quantization is crucial for compressing LLMs, but existing methods may not effectively handle Large Reasoning Models. The authors hypothesize that weight update magnitudes during fine-tuning contain valuable signals for quantization, particularly that extreme updates (both smallest and largest) are more important than intermediate ones.

Method: QuantLRM analyzes weight update magnitudes during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning, fitting restricted quadratic functions to identify important weights. It computes channel importance by multiplying average quadratic values with zero weight update counts, creating a more effective signal than activation or second-order information.

Result: QuantLRM consistently improves LRM quantization across various fine-tuning methods (supervised, DPO, RL) and four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, GPQA-Diamond). It achieves average 6.55% improvement on RL fine-tuned models and also works with non-fine-tuned LRMs via pseudo-fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Weight update magnitudes during fine-tuning provide valuable signals for LRM quantization. The "protecting both ends" phenomenon is valid, and QuantLRM effectively leverages these signals to improve quantization performance across diverse reasoning models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization is important for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term "protecting both ends". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that converts site-level solar forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts using copula-based dependence modeling and conformal prediction for coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System operators need reliable probabilistic forecasts at aggregated (fleet/system) levels for grid operations, but often only have access to heterogeneous site-level forecasts from third-party providers. Current approaches struggle with complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration when combining these forecasts.

Method: Proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework combining copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at aggregated levels. This enables dependence-aware aggregation while maintaining valid coverage and sharp prediction intervals.

Result: Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP show the Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from heterogeneous site-level inputs, providing a practical solution for system operators who cannot train or maintain system-level models.

Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy penetration has intensified the need for reliable probabilistic forecasts to support grid operations at aggregated (fleet or system) levels. In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between classical linear dynamical systems theory (Koopman operators) and modern deep learning forecasting architectures, creating theoretically principled components that offer explicit control over stability and spectral properties while maintaining forecasting performance.

Method: Introduces four learnable Koopman operator variants: scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators. These integrate with nonlinear backbones like Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer, allowing interpolation between strictly stable and unconstrained linear latent dynamics.

Result: Learnable Koopman models demonstrate favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics across multiple horizons and patch lengths. They outperform or compete with LSTM, DLinear, SSMs, and lightweight transformers in large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting that provide explicit control over spectral properties while maintaining compatibility with modern deep learning architectures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.

*Jiaxuan Zou,Zixuan Gong,Ye Su,Huayi Tang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework explaining neural scaling laws through pattern coverage of Zipfian distributions, introducing an Effective Frontier concept and showing different scaling laws emerge from different bottleneck constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical explanations for neural scaling laws are often architecture-specific or rely on complex kernel methods, lacking intuitive universality. The authors aim to provide a more general, unified framework that explains why scaling laws emerge across different architectures and tasks.

Method: The authors abstract learning tasks as progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. They introduce the Effective Frontier (k⋆) as a threshold separating learned knowledge from unlearned patterns. They prove that reducible loss is determined by the tail probability mass beyond this frontier, and derive scaling laws for model capacity (N), datasize (D), and compute (C) based on capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks.

Result: The framework successfully derives precise scaling laws for N, D, and C, showing they correspond to different bottlenecks. The authors unify these mechanisms via a Max-Bottleneck principle, demonstrating that Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws are not contradictory but represent equilibrium solutions to the same constrained optimization problem under different active bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an intuitive, universal explanation for neural scaling laws through pattern coverage of Zipfian distributions. The Effective Frontier concept and Max-Bottleneck principle reconcile seemingly contradictory scaling laws, showing they emerge from different constraint regimes in the same underlying optimization problem.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws govern the prediction power-law improvement of test loss with respect to model capacity ($N$), datasize ($D$), and compute ($C$). However, existing theoretical explanations often rely on specific architectures or complex kernel methods, lacking intuitive universality. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that abstracts general learning tasks as the progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. We introduce the Effective Frontier ($k_\star$), a threshold in the pattern rank space that separates learned knowledge from the unlearned tail. We prove that reducible loss is asymptotically determined by the probability mass of the tail a resource-dependent frontier truncation. Based on our framework, we derive the precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, attributing them to capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks, respectively. Furthermore, we unify these mechanisms via a Max-Bottleneck principle, demonstrating that the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws are not contradictory, but equilibrium solutions to the same constrained optimization problem under different active bottlenecks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a projective geometric framework using the Fubini Study metric to measure representation drift, distinguishing intrinsic changes from gauge transformations like rescalings and sign flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics (Euclidean/cosine distances) for measuring representation drift entangle intrinsic data changes with arbitrary parametrization variations, lacking invariance to gauge transformations like global rescalings or sign flips.

Method: Propose a projective geometric view using the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations differing only by gauge transformations. Construct representation trajectories and track evolution through cumulative geometric drift, comparing Euclidean, cosine, and Fubini Study distances.

Result: Conventional metrics systematically overestimate change when representations have projective ambiguity, while Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution. The difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable quantity capturing gauge-induced churn.

Conclusion: Establishes a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability, clarifies limits of angular distances, and provides a diagnostic to distinguish meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts without model-specific assumptions.

Abstract: High dimensional representation drift is commonly quantified using Euclidean or cosine distances, which presuppose fixed coordinates when comparing representations across time, training or preprocessing stages. While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows.

### [306] [ContextEvolve: Multi-Agent Context Compression for Systems Code Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02597)
*Hongyuan Su,Yu Zheng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContextEvolve: A multi-agent framework for LLM-based systems optimization that achieves RL-level efficiency without parameter updates by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate plausible code for systems research, but meeting stringent correctness and performance requirements demands iterative optimization. Existing methods have limitations: test-time RL requires parameter updates (infeasible with API-only access), while training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search.

Method: ContextEvolve uses three specialized agents: 1) Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, 2) Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and 3) Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This creates functional isomorphism with RL components (state representation, policy gradient, experience replay) for principled optimization in textual latent space.

Result: On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

Conclusion: ContextEvolve demonstrates that RL-level search efficiency can be achieved under strict parameter-blind constraints through multi-agent decomposition of optimization context, enabling effective LLM-based systems optimization without parameter updates.

Abstract: Large language models are transforming systems research by automating the discovery of performance-critical algorithms for computer systems. Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

### [307] [RAP: KV-Cache Compression via RoPE-Aligned Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02599)
*Jihao Xin,Tian Lvu,Hatem Ltaief,David Keyes,Marco Canini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAP (RoPE-Aligned Pruning) compresses KV-Cache in LLMs by pruning entire RoPE-aligned column pairs, enabling joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30% while maintaining accuracy and improving latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context inference in LLMs is bottlenecked by memory and compute costs of KV-Cache. Existing low-rank factorization methods fail in RoPE-based LLMs because RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing overhead.

Method: Proposes RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP) which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure. This restores B absorption (from W ≈ A*B factorization) and eliminates reconstruction overhead.

Result: Evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30% while maintaining strong accuracy. Reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.

Conclusion: RAP effectively addresses KV-Cache bottlenecks in RoPE-based LLMs by aligning pruning with RoPE structure, enabling significant efficiency gains without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLMs show competitive generation quality but sampling mechanisms affect refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness. The paper introduces SRI signal for interpretability and safety, enabling lightweight detectors with 100x lower overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite DLMs emerging as promising alternatives to AR models with parallel decoding and controllable sampling, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. There's a need to understand how sampling strategies affect safety independently from learned representations.

Method: The paper presents a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics to compare AR and diffusion sampling. It introduces the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal that captures internal recovery dynamics. The geometric structure of SRI identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of incomplete internal recovery.

Result: The analysis reveals that sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, distinct from underlying learned representations. SRI enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over 100x lower inference overhead.

Conclusion: Sampling mechanisms significantly influence safety behavior in language models. The SRI framework provides interpretability and improved safety for both AR and diffusion models, offering efficient detection of harmful content through analysis of internal recovery dynamics rather than just text-level observations.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding and controllable sampling dynamics while achieving competitive generation quality at scale. Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\times$ lower inference overhead.

TL;DR: Unsupervised method learns global coordinate system on data manifolds by learning tangent vector fields that transport samples to a common reference point, with integration-free objective and proven theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create interpretable global coordinates on unknown data manifolds without assuming manifold flatness (unlike isometric methods), enabling intrinsic coordinate representation tied to a shared global reference frame.

Method: Learn tangent vector fields in ambient space whose flows transport all samples to a common learnable reference point. Use non-shrinking constraint to prevent collapse, with scalable integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Prove theoretical recovery of global coordinate chart.

Result: Achieves correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. Scalable to CIFAR-10 with competitive downstream classification performance using learned coordinates.

Conclusion: Proposed unsupervised method successfully constructs global reference systems on data manifolds with theoretical guarantees, interpretable coordinates, and practical scalability to real-world datasets.

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised approach for constructing a global reference system by learning, in the ambient space, vector fields that span the tangent spaces of an unknown data manifold. In contrast to isometric objectives, which implicitly assume manifold flatness, our method learns tangent vector fields whose flows transport all samples to a common, learnable reference point. The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists. Empirically, we obtain correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. We also demonstrate the scalability of our method on CIFAR-10, where the learned coordinates achieve competitive downstream classification performance.

*Fatemeh Karimi Nejadasl,Judy Shamoun-Baranes,Eldar Rakhimberdiev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a semi-supervised method using KDE+HDR containment scores to discover novel animal behaviors in motion sensor data when some behaviors are absent from labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal behavior analysis from sensor data faces challenges: scarce labels, severe class imbalance, and potential absence of some behaviors from annotated sets. Need methods to discover novel behaviors in unlabeled data.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) Learn embedding function from labeled subset, (2) Perform label-guided clustering on embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples, (3) Use KDE+HDR containment score to determine if discovered clusters represent novel behaviors by measuring distribution overlap with known classes.

Result: Method successfully recovers distinct clusters for withheld behaviors and flags novelty via low containment scores. Negative controls (no novel behavior) show consistently higher overlaps, validating the approach.

Conclusion: HDR-based containment provides practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.

Abstract: Learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensors is challenging because labels are scarce, classes are highly imbalanced, and behaviors may be absent from the annotated set. We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.

TL;DR: Hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline GCRL using subgoal decomposition and factored structure to solve long-horizon tasks in multi-entity domains with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon goal achievement in complex environments with multiple entities is challenging due to combinatorial complexity. GCRL struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces under sparse rewards.

Method: Two-level hierarchy: value-based GCRL agent + factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. Components trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on value function.

Result: Method consistently boosts performance on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on hardest tasks and generalizing to increasing horizons and entity counts.

Conclusion: Proposed hierarchical entity-centric framework effectively addresses combinatorial complexity in multi-entity domains, demonstrating modular design compatible with existing GCRL algorithms and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) that combines subgoal decomposition with factored structure to solve long-horizon tasks in domains with multiple entities. Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

TL;DR: daVinci-Agency uses real-world software PR sequences to create high-quality training data for long-horizon LLM agent workflows, achieving significant performance gains with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-horizon agentic workflows due to lack of training data capturing authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics. Existing synthesis methods are either limited to single-feature scenarios or too expensive to scale.

Method: Mines structured supervision from Pull Request sequences through three mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories.

Result: Created substantial trajectories averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls. Fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on just 239 daVinci-Agency samples yielded broad benchmark improvements, including 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

Conclusion: Real-world software evolution (PR sequences) provides scalable, high-quality supervision for long-horizon LLM agent training, preserving causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for persistent goal-directed behavior.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...

*Mingxuan Li,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal offline RL method that addresses confounding biases in pixel-based demonstrations when there's a sensory mismatch between demonstrator and learner, achieving 120% success rate improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradient methods assume no unmeasured confounding in offline data, but this assumption fails in pixel-based demonstrations when there's a sensory capability mismatch between demonstrator and learner, leading to implicit confounding biases that degrade RL performance.

Method: Develops a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance under confounding biases, then implements a practical flow-matching approach using a deep discriminator to assess discrepancies between target policy and nominal behavioral policy.

Result: Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks show the proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods when dealing with sensory capability mismatches in pixel-based demonstrations.

Abstract: Expressive policies based on flow-matching have been successfully applied in reinforcement learning (RL) more recently due to their ability to model complex action distributions from offline data. These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.

### [314] [Learning Better Certified Models from Empirically-Robust Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02626)
*Alessandro De Palma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation from adversarially-trained teachers improves certified robustness performance trade-offs for ReLU networks in computer vision benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training methods sacrifice too much standard performance for verifiability, while adversarial training lacks formal guarantees. There's a need to bridge the gap between empirical robustness and certified robustness.

Method: Proposes knowledge distillation using adversarially-trained teachers to improve certifiably-robust models. Uses versatile feature-space distillation objective to transfer robustness knowledge from empirically-robust teachers to certifiably-robust student models.

Result: Distillation from adversarially-trained teachers consistently improves state-of-the-art certified training for ReLU networks across robust computer vision benchmarks, achieving better trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation effectively bridges empirical and certified robustness, enabling certifiably-robust models to achieve better standard performance while maintaining strong verification guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training attains strong empirical robustness to specific adversarial attacks by training on concrete adversarial perturbations, but it produces neural networks that are not amenable to strong robustness certificates through neural network verification. On the other hand, earlier certified training schemes directly train on bounds from network relaxations to obtain models that are certifiably robust, but display sub-par standard performance. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance can be obtained through a family of losses combining adversarial outputs and neural network bounds. Nevertheless, differently from empirical robustness, verifiability still comes at a significant cost in standard performance. In this work, we propose to leverage empirically-robust teachers to improve the performance of certifiably-robust models through knowledge distillation. Using a versatile feature-space distillation objective, we show that distillation from adversarially-trained teachers consistently improves on the state-of-the-art in certified training for ReLU networks across a series of robust computer vision benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates distributed pretraining techniques for smaller LLMs on academic GPU testbeds, comparing parallelism strategies and their performance under network latency constraints, with Alpa's combined optimization approach showing best results for geographically distributed GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs are more practical for pretraining on limited datasets, but distributed training on academic GPU clusters faces challenges with network latency and parallelism optimization, especially when GPUs are geographically distributed.

Method: Experimental evaluation using GPT-2 medium/large models on commodity GPU clusters with homogeneous/heterogeneous hardware. Tested data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, inter-operator/pipeline parallelism and their combinations using Alpa and Ray frameworks. Measured performance under varying network latencies (10s of milliseconds).

Result: Alpa's execution plans that jointly optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed best for geographically distributed GPUs, especially with 10s of milliseconds network latency. The study provides insights for selecting optimal pretraining techniques.

Conclusion: A systematic approach is proposed for selecting appropriate pretraining techniques to achieve high training performance with lower execution time and reduced GPU usage, particularly valuable for academic/resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require enormous computing power to pretrain on massive datasets. When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.

*Alexander Ryabchenko,Idan Attias,Daniel M. Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reduction-based framework for online learning with delayed feedback that improves regret bounds for both first-order and bandit convex optimization by decomposing regret into delay-independent learning and delay-induced drift terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online learning algorithms struggle with delayed feedback scenarios where observations arrive after some delay. Current approaches have suboptimal regret bounds, particularly for bandit convex optimization with delayed feedback.

Method: Introduces a continuous-time model where regret decomposes into delay-independent learning term and delay-induced drift term. Provides a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any online linear optimization algorithm into one handling round-dependent delays.

Result: For bandit convex optimization: improves delay-dependent term from O(min{√(T d_max), (T d_tot)^{1/3}}) to O(√d_tot). For strongly convex case: improves from O(d_max ln T) to O(min{σ_max ln T, √d_tot}) where σ_max may be much smaller than d_max.

Conclusion: The reduction-based framework provides simpler unified analysis for first-order feedback and significantly improved regret bounds for bandit convex optimization with delayed feedback, achieving delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates.

Abstract: We develop a reduction-based framework for online learning with delayed feedback that recovers and improves upon existing results for both first-order and bandit convex optimization. Our approach introduces a continuous-time model under which regret decomposes into a delay-independent learning term and a delay-induced drift term, yielding a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any algorithm for online linear optimization into one that handles round-dependent delays. For bandit convex optimization, we significantly improve existing regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates. For first-order feedback, we recover state-of-the-art regret bounds via a simpler, unified analysis. Quantitatively, for bandit convex optimization we obtain $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}} + T^{\frac{3}{4}}\sqrt{k})$ regret, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(\min\{\sqrt{T d_{\text{max}}},(Td_{\text{tot}})^{\frac{1}{3}}\})$ in previous work to $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}})$. Here, $k$, $T$, $d_{\text{max}}$, and $d_{\text{tot}}$ denote the dimension, time horizon, maximum delay, and total delay, respectively. Under strong convexity, we achieve $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\} + (T^2\ln T)^{\frac{1}{3}} {k}^{\frac{2}{3}})$, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(d_{\text{max}} \ln T)$ in previous work to $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\})$, where $σ_{\text{max}}$ denotes the maximum number of outstanding observations and may be considerably smaller than $d_{\text{max}}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two spatially regularized NMF methods (SNMF and hSNMF) for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data analysis, showing improved spatial compactness, cluster separability, and biological coherence compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms like Xenium generate extremely high-dimensional single-cell images with both molecular and spatial information, posing major challenges for representation learning and clustering that need to address both modalities effectively.

Method: Two spatially regularized NMF variants: 1) SNMF enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood; 2) hSNMF performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency matrix that integrates spatial proximity (contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity with a tunable mixing parameter alpha.

Result: On a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieved markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed spatially regularized NMF methods effectively integrate spatial and transcriptomic information for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics analysis, providing superior performance in spatial organization, cluster quality, and biological interpretability.

Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms, such as Xenium, generate single-cell images that capture both molecular and spatial context, but their extremely high dimensionality poses major challenges for representation learning and clustering. In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLFFs rely on fixed angular expansions that limit flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions, restricting expressiveness and performance.

Method: Introduces Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), which extends spherical attention to SE(3) equivariance, operates directly on angular/radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, and can be plug-and-play integrated into models like MACE.

Result: MARA improves energy and force predictions, reduces high-error events, and enhances robustness across molecular benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous spherical attention is an effective geometric operator that increases expressiveness, stability, and reliability of atomistic models.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have become essential for accurate and efficient atomistic modeling. Despite their high accuracy, most existing approaches rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions. We introduce Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), a module that extends spherical attention -- originally developed for SO(3) tasks -- to the molecular domain and SE(3), providing an efficient approximation of equivariant interactions. MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications. Across molecular benchmarks, MARA improves energy and force predictions, reduces high-error events, and enhances robustness. These results demonstrate that continuous spherical attention is an effective and generalizable geometric operator that increases the expressiveness, stability, and reliability of atomistic models.

*Riccardo Zaccone,Stefanos Laskaridis,Marco Ciccone,Samuel Horváth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexRank enables adaptive deployment of large models by extracting nested submodels from pretrained networks using low-rank decomposition and importance-based consolidation, allowing cost-performance trade-offs without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large neural networks (LLMs, ViTs) from scratch is prohibitively expensive, and current deployment uses fixed-cost monolithic models that don't leverage overparameterization or adapt to different computational budgets.

Method: FlexRank uses low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract importance-ordered nested components from pretrained models, enabling selective activation based on available computational budget.

Result: Enables a "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm that provides graceful trade-offs between cost and performance without requiring training from scratch for each budget.

Conclusion: FlexRank advances practical deployment of large models by making them computationally adaptive through extraction of nested submodels from pretrained networks.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep neural networks, encompassing large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has made training from scratch prohibitively expensive and deployment increasingly costly. These models are often used as computational monoliths with fixed cost, a rigidity that does not leverage overparametrized architectures and largely hinders adaptive deployment across different cost budgets. We argue that importance-ordered nested components can be extracted from pretrained models, and selectively activated on the available computational budget. To this end, our proposed FlexRank method leverages low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract submodels of increasing capabilities. Our approach enables a "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm that offers a graceful trade-off between cost and performance without training from scratch for each budget - advancing practical deployment of large models.

*Marcos Villagra,Bidhan Roy,Raihan Seraj,Zhiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDMs show stability-quality dissociation: full ensemble routing is most stable but worst quality, while sparse routing prioritizing expert-data alignment achieves best generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what governs generation quality in Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) where experts trained on disjoint data clusters can strongly disagree in predictions.

Method: Systematic investigation comparing different routing strategies, analyzing stability metrics, and validating expert-data alignment through: (1) data-cluster distance analysis, (2) per-expert prediction accuracy analysis, and (3) expert disagreement analysis across two distinct DDM systems.

Result: Found stability-quality dissociation: full ensemble routing achieves most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence but worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Expert-data alignment governs quality - sparse routing selects experts whose training distribution covers current denoising state.

Conclusion: For DDM deployment, routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics, as generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training data covers the current denoising state.

Abstract: Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) route denoising through experts trained independently on disjoint data clusters, which can strongly disagree in their predictions. What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.

TL;DR: Proposes a sparsely supervised learning method using masking during diffusion model training to improve spatial consistency and reduce memorization, achieving competitive FID scores with up to 98% pixel masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms, producing samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent.

Method: Introduces sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models using a simple masking strategy that can mask up to 98% of pixels during training, implemented with only a few lines of code.

Result: Achieves competitive FID scores across experiments, avoids training instability on small datasets, reduces memorization, and promotes use of essential contextual information during generation.

Conclusion: Sparsely supervised learning with masking effectively addresses spatial inconsistency in diffusion models while maintaining performance and improving training stability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. However, they often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation, arguably due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms. This can yield samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent. To mitigate this issue, we propose sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models, a simple yet effective masking strategy that can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Interestingly, the experiments show that it is safe to mask up to 98\% of pixels during diffusion model training. Our method delivers competitive FID scores across experiments and, most importantly, avoids training instability on small datasets. Moreover, the masking strategy reduces memorization and promotes the use of essential contextual information during generation.

*Sayak Chakrabarti,Toniann Pitassi,Josh Alman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows a precise tradeoff between Transformer expressivity and quantization precision: for each precision level p, there exists a function that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute with p bits but not with p-1 bits, explaining empirical quantization sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically characterize the effect of quantization on Transformer expressivity, explaining why empirical loss of expressivity occurs when reducing numerical precision during inference acceleration.

Method: Combines explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds to prove tight one-bit thresholds for expressivity.

Result: For every precision level p, there exists a function (inspired by equality) that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute with p bits but not with p-1 bits, establishing a fine-grained tradeoff between expressivity and precision.

Conclusion: Tasks requiring equality-like comparisons are especially sensitive to quantization, and precision should be chosen based on the length of equality checks needed for specific tasks, providing guidance for practical quantization decisions.

Abstract: Quantization reduces the numerical precision of Transformer computations and is widely used to accelerate inference, yet its effect on expressivity remains poorly characterized. We demonstrate a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between expressivity and precision: For every p we exhibit a function Γ, inspired by the equality function, and prove that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute Γ, with p bits of precision, but not with p-1 bits of precision.
  This result concretely explains the widely observed phenomenon of empirical loss of expressivity when quantization is used. Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.
  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight "one-bit" threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) performs poorly in real-world binary classification settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision, creating a need for more robust approaches.

Method: BinaryPPO uses offline reinforcement learning with a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, learning robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction.

Result: Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple model architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification, with BinaryPPO demonstrating superior performance in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for binary classification tasks such as toxicity detection, factuality verification, and causal inference. However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/BinaryPPO.

TL;DR: MaxRL is a new reinforcement learning framework that approximates maximum likelihood optimization using sampling-based techniques, achieving better scaling efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning in sampling-based setups with binary feedback (like navigation, code generation, math problems) doesn't actually maximize the likelihood of correct rollouts - it only optimizes a lower-order approximation. The authors want to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL) - a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard RL and exact maximum likelihood as more sampling compute is allocated. Uses simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimators.

Result: MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods across all tested models and tasks, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to GRPO-trained counterparts. Also shows better scaling with additional data and compute.

Conclusion: MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness-based settings, effectively bridging the gap between reinforcement learning and maximum likelihood optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the method of choice to train models in sampling-based setups with binary outcome feedback, such as navigation, code generation, and mathematical problem solving. In such settings, models implicitly induce a likelihood over correct rollouts. However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute. Our results suggest MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness based settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many methods exist for choosing steering directions in LLM control, there's limited understanding of how to choose the optimal steering magnitude, which is crucial for effective control without degrading model performance.

Method: Proposes first theoretical analysis of steering strength, characterizing its effects on next token probability, concept presence, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities.

Result: Analysis reveals surprising non-monotonic effects of steering strength, with theoretical predictions validated empirically on eleven language models ranging from small GPT architectures to modern models.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding and controlling steering strength in LLM representation steering, enabling more effective post-training control of language models.

Abstract: A popular approach to post-training control of large language models (LLMs) is the steering of intermediate latent representations. Namely, identify a well-chosen direction depending on the task at hand and perturbs representations along this direction at inference time. While many propositions exist to pick this direction, considerably less is understood about how to choose the magnitude of the move, whereas its importance is clear: too little and the intended behavior does not emerge, too much and the model's performance degrades beyond repair. In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically on eleven language models, ranging from a small GPT architecture to modern models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models encode rich semantic information, but it's challenging to understand which parts they actually use for predictions. Existing concept-based explanation methods using clustering (hierarchical clustering, K-Means) have scalability issues or produce shallow/frequency-dominated clusters.

Method: Proposes VQLC (vector quantized latent concept) framework built on VQ-VAE (vector quantized-variational autoencoder) architecture that learns a discrete codebook to map continuous representations to concept vectors.

Result: VQLC improves scalability while maintaining comparable quality of human-understandable explanations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VQLC provides a scalable solution for concept-based explanations of deep learning models, addressing limitations of traditional clustering approaches while preserving explanation quality.

Abstract: Deep Learning models encode rich semantic information in their hidden representations. However, it remains challenging to understand which parts of this information models actually rely on when making predictions. A promising line of post-hoc concept-based explanation methods relies on clustering token representations. However, commonly used approaches such as hierarchical clustering are computationally infeasible for large-scale datasets, and K-Means often yields shallow or frequency-dominated clusters. We propose the vector quantized latent concept (VQLC) method, a framework built upon the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture that learns a discrete codebook mapping continuous representations to concept vectors. We perform thorough evaluations and show that VQLC improves scalability while maintaining comparable quality of human-understandable explanations.

TL;DR: SearchDiff integrates symbolic search into discrete diffusion models to enforce hard constraints and optimize non-differentiable properties during inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard discrete diffusion models focus on matching data distributions but lack mechanisms for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties at inference time, limiting their applicability to structured generation tasks.

Method: SearchDiff is a training-free neurosymbolic framework that combines informed search with diffusion denoising. At each denoising step, model predictions create a proposal set that is optimized under user-specified property satisfaction, modifying reverse transitions to steer sampling toward feasible solutions.

Result: Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning show SearchDiff substantially improves constraint satisfaction and property adherence while outperforming both discrete diffusion and autoregressive baselines.

Conclusion: SearchDiff successfully addresses the limitation of standard discrete diffusion models by integrating symbolic search, enabling constraint satisfaction and property optimization without retraining, making it effective for structured generation tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models generate sequences by iteratively denoising samples corrupted by categorical noise, offering an appealing alternative to autoregressive decoding for structured and symbolic generation. However, standard training targets a likelihood-based objective that primarily matches the data distribution and provides no native mechanism for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties at inference time. This work addresses this limitation and introduces Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion (SearchDiff), a training-free neurosymbolic inference framework that integrates informed search directly into the reverse denoising process. At each denoising step, the model predictions define a proposal set that is optimized under a user-specified property satisfaction, yielding a modified reverse transition that steers sampling toward probable and feasible solutions. Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning illustrate that SearchDiff substantially improves constraint satisfaction and property adherence, while consistently outperforming discrete diffusion and autoregressive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention entangles different temporal structures through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. There's a need for attention that can handle distinct temporal patterns separately.

Method: CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths: Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline. The Clock mechanism provides learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance.

Result: Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks show CAPS surpasses vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms, and demonstrates competitive performance against seven strong baselines while maintaining linear complexity.

Conclusion: CAPS provides an effective structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that successfully decouples different temporal patterns while maintaining computational efficiency with linear complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents $\textbf{CAPS}$ (Clock-weighted Aggregation with Prefix-products and Softmax), a structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that decouples three distinct temporal structures: global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns. Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity.

Result: Achieves competitive diversity across structured parametric design spaces, robustness to sampling/resolution variations, low performance error (<2% for ship hulls), and significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements compared to diffusion models.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical, data-efficient engineering design generation with rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new settings, and easy integration into real-world workflows.

Abstract: Deep generative models for engineering design often require substantial computational cost, large training datasets, and extensive retraining when design requirements or datasets change, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering design workflow. In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric data pruning methods are unstable due to reliance on extrinsic geometry, making them sensitive to latent space perturbations, cross-architecture transfer issues, and feature noise.

Method: Two-scale topological approach: (1) topology-aware manifold approximation for global low-dimensional embedding, (2) differentiable persistent homology for local topological optimization to rank samples by structural complexity.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and precision at significant pruning rates (e.g., 90%), shows exceptional robustness to noise perturbations, and demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures.

Conclusion: TopoPrune provides a stable, principled topology-based framework for robust data-efficient learning, leveraging the inherent stability properties of topology.

Abstract: Geometric data pruning methods, while practical for leveraging pretrained models, are fundamentally unstable. Their reliance on extrinsic geometry renders them highly sensitive to latent space perturbations, causing performance to degrade during cross-architecture transfer or in the presence of feature noise. We introduce TopoPrune, a framework which resolves this challenge by leveraging topology to capture the stable, intrinsic structure of data. TopoPrune operates at two scales, (1) utilizing a topology-aware manifold approximation to establish a global low-dimensional embedding of the dataset. Subsequently, (2) it employs differentiable persistent homology to perform a local topological optimization on the manifold embeddings, ranking samples by their structural complexity. We demonstrate that our unified dual-scale topological approach ensures high accuracy and precision, particularly at significant dataset pruning rates (e.g., 90%). Furthermore, through the inherent stability properties of topology, TopoPrune is (a) exceptionally robust to noise perturbations of latent feature embeddings and (b) demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures. This study demonstrates a promising avenue towards stable and principled topology-based frameworks for robust data-efficient learning.

Conclusion: EDT-Former provides an effective solution for molecular graph understanding by addressing limitations of existing approaches through entropy-guided dynamic token generation, enabling efficient alignment between graph encoders and LLMs without costly backbone fine-tuning.

Abstract: Molecular understanding is central to advancing areas such as scientific discovery, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand molecular graphs effectively. Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks.

We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding

*Sacha Morin,Moonsub Byeon,Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau,Sébastien Lachapelle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSIL methods using inverse dynamics models (IDM) outperform behavior cloning due to IDM's better sample efficiency from lower complexity and less stochasticity, leading to improved LAPO algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why IDM-based semi-supervised imitation learning methods outperform behavior cloning, and to leverage these insights for improved policy learning algorithms.

Method: Analyze IDM-based policies (VM-IDM and IDM labeling) theoretically and empirically, study their equivalence in limit cases, examine IDM learning efficiency using statistical learning theory and experiments with unified video-action prediction architectures.

Result: IDM-based policies outperform behavior cloning due to two factors: (1) ground-truth IDM has lower complexity than expert policy, and (2) IDM is less stochastic than expert policy, making IDM learning more sample efficient.

Conclusion: The superior performance of IDM-based SSIL methods stems from IDM's sample efficiency advantages, motivating an improved version of the LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.

Abstract: Semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL) consists in learning a policy from a small dataset of action-labeled trajectories and a much larger dataset of action-free trajectories. Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.

### [334] [Exposing Vulnerabilities in Explanation for Time Series Classifiers via Dual-Target Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02763)
*Bohan Wang,Zewen Liu,Lu Lin,Hui Liu,Li Xiong,Ming Jin,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSEF attack shows that time series explanations can be adversarially manipulated to appear consistent while changing predictions, revealing explanation stability is not a reliable proxy for decision robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretable time series systems assume temporal consistency in explanations indicates robustness, but this assumption may be flawed. The paper aims to demonstrate that predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, allowing attackers to manipulate predictions while maintaining plausible explanations.

Method: Proposes TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates both classifier and explainer outputs. Unlike single-objective misclassification attacks that broadly disrupt explanations, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with a chosen reference rationale.

Result: Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, TSEF successfully demonstrates that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness. The attack reveals vulnerabilities in current interpretable time series systems and shows that explanations can be manipulated to appear consistent while changing predictions.

Conclusion: Explanation stability should not be treated as evidence of robustness in time series deep learning. The findings motivate the need for coupling-aware robustness evaluations and more comprehensive security assessments for trustworthy time series tasks.

Abstract: Interpretable time series deep learning systems are often assessed by checking temporal consistency on explanations, implicitly treating this as evidence of robustness. We show that this assumption can fail: Predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, enabling targeted misclassification while the explanation remains plausible and consistent with a chosen reference rationale. We propose TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates the classifier and explainer outputs. In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference. Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, our results consistently reveal that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness and motivate coupling-aware robustness evaluations for trustworthy time series tasks.

### [335] [Privately Fine-Tuned LLMs Preserve Temporal Dynamics in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02766)
*Lucas Rosenblatt,Peihan Liu,Ryan McKenna,Natalia Ponomareva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATH is a differentially private synthetic data generation framework for longitudinal datasets that preserves temporal coherence using autoregressive LLMs, outperforming traditional marginal-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentially private synthetic data methods focus on independent rows, neglecting temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets like EHRs where users contribute sequences of events. Flattening user histories into vectors fails to preserve temporal coherence even when maintaining valid marginal distributions.

Method: PATH treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models to capture long-range dependencies and temporal patterns in sequential data.

Result: PATH reduces distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods for longitudinal data by preserving temporal coherence through autoregressive modeling, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex sequential dependencies.

Abstract: Research on differentially private synthetic tabular data has largely focused on independent and identically distributed rows where each record corresponds to a unique individual. This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.

### [336] [Provable Effects of Data Replay in Continual Learning: A Feature Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02767)
*Meng Ding,Jinhui Xu,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows that even with full data replay in continual learning, forgetting can still occur when cumulative noise from later tasks dominates earlier task signals, but sufficient signal accumulation can recover poorly learned tasks, with task ordering (prioritizing high-signal tasks) being crucial for preventing forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze the effectiveness of full data replay in continual learning, which is considered simple and effective but lacks comprehensive theoretical understanding, particularly from a feature learning perspective.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework using multi-view data model and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis for task-incremental binary classification across M tasks, focusing on feature learning dynamics during full data replay training.

Result: Two key findings: (1) forgetting can still occur with full replay when cumulative noise from later tasks dominates earlier task signals; (2) sufficient signal accumulation can recover earlier tasks even if initially poorly learned. Also discovered that prioritizing higher-signal tasks helps learn lower-signal tasks and prevents catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Full data replay effectiveness depends on signal-to-noise ratio dynamics, with task ordering being a critical factor - prioritizing high-signal tasks first can mitigate forgetting and improve overall continual learning performance, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models on a sequence of tasks while retaining performance on previously learned ones. A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.

### [337] [BiTimeCrossNet: Time-Aware Self-Supervised Learning for Pediatric Sleep](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02769)
*Saurav Raj Pandey,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BTCNet is a multimodal self-supervised learning framework for long physiological recordings that incorporates temporal context and cross-modal interactions, outperforming time-unaware variants and existing methods on pediatric sleep tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for physiological signal analysis often treat short segments as independent samples, ignoring important temporal context within longer recordings like overnight sleep studies. This limits their ability to capture meaningful patterns that depend on when events occur within a recording session.

Method: BTCNet incorporates temporal information about when each segment occurs within its parent recording and learns pairwise interactions between physiological signals via cross-attention. It operates without task labels or sequence-level supervision, using a self-supervised learning approach.

Result: BTCNet consistently outperforms non-time-aware variants under frozen-backbone linear probing across six pediatric sleep tasks (sleep staging, arousal detection, respiratory event detection). Gains generalize to independent pediatric datasets, and BTCNet achieves strong performance compared to existing multimodal self-supervised sleep models, particularly on respiration-related tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal context and cross-modal interactions in self-supervised learning significantly improves performance on physiological signal analysis tasks, demonstrating the importance of modeling when events occur within longer recordings and how different physiological signals interact.

Abstract: We present BiTimeCrossNet (BTCNet), a multimodal self-supervised learning framework for long physiological recordings such as overnight sleep studies. While many existing approaches train on short segments treated as independent samples, BTCNet incorporates information about when each segment occurs within its parent recording, for example within a sleep session. BTCNet further learns pairwise interactions between physiological signals via cross-attention, without requiring task labels or sequence-level supervision.
  We evaluate BTCNet on pediatric sleep data across six downstream tasks, including sleep staging, arousal detection, and respiratory event detection. Under frozen-backbone linear probing, BTCNet consistently outperforms an otherwise identical non-time-aware variant, with gains that generalize to an independent pediatric dataset. Compared to existing multimodal self-supervised sleep models, BTCNet achieves strong performance, particularly on respiration-related tasks.

*Scagnetto Arjuna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECG biometrics can strongly identify individuals even from tabular features, with deep learning models achieving high verification/identification accuracy, raising serious privacy concerns for ECG anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how strongly ECG signals can be linked to individuals and assess the privacy risks of ECG anonymization, particularly whether releasing only tabular features provides sufficient privacy protection.

Method: Used MLP-based embedding networks on tabular features, then adopted ArcFace embedding models on both features and ECG waveforms. Evaluated on large-scale test sets with verification (TAR@FAR), closed-set identification (Rank@1, Rank@10), and open-set identification with two-stage pipeline (top-K shortlist + re-ranking).

Result: Identity information exists even in tabular features. Deep learning on waveforms significantly outperforms features: verification achieved TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3, TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4, EER=2.53%; closed-set identification: Rank@1=0.812, Rank@10=0.910; open-set: DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at strict FAR thresholds.

Conclusion: ECG carries a strong individual signature that enables re-identification even from tabular features, with performance amplified by embedding models. This demonstrates that ECG anonymization based solely on releasing features does not guarantee privacy, necessitating careful consideration of privacy implications and operational protocols.

Abstract: This work studies electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics at large scale, evaluating how strongly an ECG can be linked to an individual and, consequently, how its anonymization may be compromised. We show that identity information is already present in tabular representations (fiducial features): even a simple MLP-based embedding network yields non-trivial performance, indicating that anonymization based solely on releasing features does not guarantee privacy. We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test. On a large-scale test set, verification achieves high TAR at strict FAR thresholds (TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3; TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4) with EER=2.53% (all-vs-all); closed-set identification yields Rank@1=0.812 and Rank@10=0.910. In open-set, a two-stage pipeline (top-K shortlist on embeddings + re-ranking) reaches DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at FAR=1e-3 and 1e-4. Overall, the results show that ECG carries a measurable individual signature: re-identification is already possible with tabular features and is further amplified by embedding-based models, making privacy implications and realistic operational protocols essential to consider.

*Arian Khorasani,Théophile Demazure*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTAF is a self-supervised fusion module for asynchronous EEG and physiology data that learns soft bidirectional alignments using time-aware cross attention and alignment-regularized contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal fusion methods ignore or handle temporal asynchrony between EEG and peripheral physiology with costly warping techniques, despite the importance of modeling the coupling between central and autonomic nervous systems.

Method: Proposes Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF) with time-aware cross attention for soft bidirectional alignments, lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision.

Result: On K-EmoCon dataset, CTAF achieves higher cosine margins for matched pairs, better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and competitive performance on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels.

Conclusion: CTAF represents a significant advancement toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony by directly modeling correspondence between modalities.

Abstract: We study multimodal affect modeling when EEG and peripheral physiology are asynchronous, which most fusion methods ignore or handle with costly warping. We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.

*Yu Qin,Phillip Sloan,Raul Santos-Rodriguez,Majid Mirmehdi,Telmo de Menezes e Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMON is a model-agnostic framework for local explanations of multimodal predictions that produces unified explanations with modality-level and feature-level attributions while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainability methods are often single-modal, architecture-dependent, or too computationally expensive to run at scale for multimodal models.

Method: LEMON fits a single modality-aware surrogate with group-structured sparsity to produce unified explanations that disentangle modality-level contributions and feature-level attributions, treating the predictor as a black box with few forward passes.

Result: LEMON achieves competitive deletion-based faithfulness while reducing black-box evaluations by 35-67 times and runtime by 2-8 times compared to strong multimodal baselines across vision-language QA and clinical prediction tasks.

Conclusion: LEMON provides an efficient, model-agnostic framework for local explanations of multimodal predictions that balances faithfulness with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal models are ubiquitous, yet existing explainability methods are often single-modal, architecture-dependent, or too computationally expensive to run at scale. We introduce LEMON (Local Explanations via Modality-aware OptimizatioN), a model-agnostic framework for local explanations of multimodal predictions. LEMON fits a single modality-aware surrogate with group-structured sparsity to produce unified explanations that disentangle modality-level contributions and feature-level attributions. The approach treats the predictor as a black box and is computationally efficient, requiring relatively few forward passes while remaining faithful under repeated perturbations. We evaluate LEMON on vision-language question answering and a clinical prediction task with image, text, and tabular inputs, comparing against representative multimodal baselines. Across backbones, LEMON achieves competitive deletion-based faithfulness while reducing black-box evaluations by 35-67 times and runtime by 2-8 times compared to strong multimodal baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop physics foundation models that provide real-time PDE solutions that preserve structure and accuracy when adapted to unseen geometries, addressing the challenge of generalization to new domains.

Method: Introduces General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW), a data-driven finite element method that jointly learns a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces. Uses transformer-based encoding of discretized meshes and Finite Element Exterior Calculus to preserve physical conservation laws exactly.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks and shows significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.

Conclusion: Geo-NeW provides a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs by explicitly connecting geometry and boundary conditions to solutions, enabling better generalization to unseen domains while preserving physical structure.

Abstract: We aim to develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which preserve structure and accuracy under adaptation to unseen geometries. To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how small perturbations propagate through flow matching models using Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) to analyze dependency structure in generated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how latent perturbations affect generated features in flow matching models and develop practical tools for analyzing dependency structures in these generative models.

Method: Use Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) to analyze perturbation propagation; derive closed-form expressions for optimal drift and Jacobians in Gaussian/mixture-of-Gaussian settings; compose flow with attribute classifiers for attribute-level JVP estimation.

Result: Numerical JVPs recover analytical Jacobians in synthetic benchmarks; attribute-level JVP estimators recover empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA; conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations consistent with common-cause structure.

Conclusion: Even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure; JVPs provide practical tools for analyzing dependency structures in flow matching models, though conditioning on classifier-Jacobian norms is not a formal do intervention.

Abstract: Flow matching learns a velocity field that transports a base distribution to data. We study how small latent perturbations propagate through these flows and show that Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) provide a practical lens on dependency structure in the generated features. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal drift and its Jacobian in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian settings, revealing that even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure. In low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks, numerical JVPs recover the analytical Jacobians. In image domains, composing the flow with an attribute classifier yields an attribute-level JVP estimator that recovers empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA. Conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in a way consistent with a hypothesized common-cause structure, while we emphasize that this conditioning is not a formal do intervention.

TL;DR: AgentOWL learns hierarchical skills and abstract world models efficiently for Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable agents to perform new skills by composing existing ones, addressing the data inefficiency of current hierarchical RL methods.

Method: Jointly learns hierarchical neural options and abstract world models (abstracting states and time) in a sample-efficient way.

Result: Learns more skills with much less data than baselines on Object-Centric Atari games.

Conclusion: AgentOWL provides an effective approach for sample-efficient hierarchical skill acquisition through joint world model and option learning.

Abstract: Building agents that can perform new skills by composing existing skills is a long-standing goal of AI agent research. Towards this end, we investigate how to efficiently acquire a sequence of skills, formalized as hierarchical neural options. However, existing model-free hierarchical reinforcement algorithms need a lot of data. We propose a novel method, which we call AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), that jointly learns -- in a sample efficient way -- an abstract world model (abstracting across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options. We show, on a subset of Object-Centric Atari games, that our method can learn more skills using much less data than baseline methods.

*Mathieu Even,Clément Berenfeld,Linus Bleistein,Tudor Cebere,Julie Josse,Aurélien Bellet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper frames Membership Inference Attack (MIA) evaluation as a causal inference problem, revealing biases in existing protocols and proposing principled estimators with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MIA evaluation requires repeated retraining which is computationally expensive for large models. One-run and zero-run methods are used as alternatives but their statistical validity is unclear, creating a need for principled evaluation methods.

Method: The authors frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in training. They derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show the approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift. The method reveals biases in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations are confounded by non-random membership assignment.

Conclusion: The causal inference framework provides a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems, enabling reliable memorization measurement across different evaluation regimes with statistical guarantees.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.

TL;DR: CNM (Continuous Number Modeling) directly models numerical parameters in SVGs as continuous values instead of discrete tokens, improving training speed by 30% and perceptual quality for vector graphics generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics like SVGs offer benefits over raster images (flexibility, efficiency, editing ease) but are less explored. Current approaches inefficiently encode numerical parameters as long token sequences, slowing training, reducing accuracy, and hurting generalization.

Method: Proposes Continuous Number Modeling (CNM) that treats numbers as first-class continuous values rather than discrete tokens. Trains multimodal transformer on 2M raster-to-SVG samples, then fine-tunes with reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback.

Result: Improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. Establishes CNM as practical and efficient for high-quality vector generation.

Conclusion: CNM aligns model inputs with data's continuous nature, removes discretization artifacts, and offers a practical approach for vector graphics generation with potential for broader applications beyond SVGs.

Abstract: For certain image generation tasks, vector graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) offer clear benefits such as increased flexibility, size efficiency, and editing ease, but remain less explored than raster-based approaches. A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. This work establishes CNM as a practical and efficient approach for high-quality vector generation, with potential for broader applications. We make our code available http://github.com/mikeogezi/CNM.

*Yingchuan Zhang,Terry Ma,Wenxuan Zhong,Ping Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PACER enables LLM reasoning traces to collaboratively review each other's work, transforming simple voting into a logical refinement process that reduces near-miss errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard aggregation methods like majority voting evaluate each reasoning trace in isolation, creating a "blind spot" where hallucinated paths with misleading high confidence can suppress the true solution by narrow margins in difficult problems.

Method: PACER (Packet-Conditioned Revision) is a training-free inference framework where traces "peer-review" each other. After preliminary screening, it constructs a consensus packet with candidate answers, aggregated confidence scores, and reasoning summaries. Individual traces then perform targeted self-review conditioned on this packet to identify logical divergence points and potentially revise their conclusions.

Result: On challenging math benchmarks (AIME and BRUMO), PACER matches or exceeds the accuracy of 256-sample majority voting, significantly outperforming raw ensemble baselines by transforming consensus into collaborative logical refinement.

Conclusion: Enabling reasoning traces to coordinate through structured peer-review addresses fundamental limitations of isolated evaluation, improving accuracy on difficult problems where traditional voting methods fail due to near-miss errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on challenging reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute through multiple trajectory sampling. However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental "blind spot": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to "peer-review" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?
  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories. On challenging competitive math benchmarks such as AIME and BRUMO, PACER matches or exceeds the accuracy of 256-sample majority voting, significantly outperforming raw ensemble baselines by transforming simple consensus into a collaborative logical refinement process.

TL;DR: SC3D is a two-stage differentiable framework for discovering causal structures from multivariate time series, jointly learning lag-specific adjacency matrices and instantaneous DAGs with improved stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery from multivariate time series is challenging due to interactions across multiple lags, potential instantaneous dependencies, and the combinatorial search space of dynamic graphs. Existing methods need improvement in stability and accuracy for recovering both lagged and instantaneous causal structures.

Method: Two-stage differentiable framework: Stage 1 performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges. Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity while enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block.

Result: SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems.

Conclusion: SC3D provides an effective differentiable framework for discovering causal structures in multivariate time series, addressing the challenges of lagged interactions, instantaneous dependencies, and combinatorial search space through its two-stage approach.

Abstract: Discovering causal structures from multivariate time series is a key problem because interactions span across multiple lags and possibly involve instantaneous dependencies. Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical data-driven surrogate models for turbulent flows trade off short-term accuracy for long-horizon stability. Existing Koopman autoencoders operate in discrete-time settings, limiting temporal flexibility and generalization capabilities.

Method: Introduces a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. The approach maps nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted, allowing variable timesteps at inference.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution, generalizes beyond training regimes, and shows learned dynamics that closely adhere to analytical matrix exponential solutions, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting.

Conclusion: The continuous-time Koopman framework provides improved accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties for turbulent flow simulation compared to discrete-time approaches, offering better temporal flexibility and long-horizon performance.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating the simulation of turbulent flows. However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting. We evaluate the approach on classical CFD benchmarks and report accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties.

### [349] [Tabula RASA: Exposing and Breaking the Relational Bottleneck in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02834)
*Jonas Petersen,Camilla Mazzoleni,Riccardo Maggioni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention) improves transformer performance on multi-hop relational reasoning tasks by adding edge-type embeddings and sparse attention masking, matching GPT-4 at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data despite strong performance in other domains. Standard transformers have circuit complexity limitations requiring Ω(k) layers for k-hop reasoning.

Method: Introduces RASA with two key modifications: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. This reduces attention search space from O(2^{n^2}) to O(2^m) patterns.

Result: RASA outperforms standard transformers on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, matching GPT-4 performance at lower cost. Advantages grow with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop).

Conclusion: Minimal structural modifications to transformers (edge-type embeddings and sparse attention) substantially improve multi-hop reasoning capabilities, though formal learnability guarantees are not claimed.

Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and require $Ω(k)$ layers for $k$-hop reasoning. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal modification adding: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. While RASA has the same asymptotic depth requirements, sparse masking reduces the attention search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ patterns, and edge biases provide explicit relation routing. Empirically, on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, RASA outperforms standard transformers and matches GPT-4 at lower cost, with advantages growing with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop). We do not claim formal learnability guarantees; the contribution is empirical validation that minimal structural modifications substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.

*Jae-Sung Bae,Minje Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeLDA is a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that uses conditional diffusion models in foundation model latent spaces to address data scarcity in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning underperforms in data-scarce settings despite foundation models' strong generalization. Even with pre-trained features, downstream fine-tuning suffers from limited labeled data, requiring effective data augmentation methods.

Method: GeLDA leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in FM-induced latent spaces, which are low-dimensional and concentrate task-relevant information. It conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors capturing semantic relationships among classes/subdomains.

Result: In zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improved Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%. In long-tailed image classification, it achieved 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: GeLDA effectively addresses data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic data in foundation model latent spaces, demonstrating strong performance improvements in challenging low-resource recognition tasks.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in data-rich regimes, deep learning often underperforms in the data-scarce settings common in practice. While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.

*Ali Abbasi,Chayne Thrash,Haoran Qin,Shansita Sharma,Sepehr Seifi,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZS-SVD is a post-training LLM compression method that uses activation whitening and first-order loss estimates to globally select singular components with a zero-sum rule, automatically allocating heterogeneous ranks without optimization, plus optional gradient correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVD-based compression methods either use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices (ignoring sensitivity differences) or rely on expensive iterative optimization for rank allocation, making efficient compression challenging.

Method: ZS-SVD performs global singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. It prunes components across the whole model with a zero-sum rule that keeps cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks. Optionally applies a single projected gradient update after truncation followed by re-truncation.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios.

Conclusion: ZS-SVD provides an effective post-training compression method that automatically allocates heterogeneous ranks without expensive optimization, achieving better performance than prior methods.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have driven strong performance across many tasks, but their memory and compute costs still hinder deployment. SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/mint-vu/Zero-Sum-SVD

### [352] [Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation: Learning Per-Layer Symmetry Relaxation from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02853)
*Stefanos Pertigkiozoglou,Mircea Petrache,Shubhendu Trivedi,Kostas Daniilidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RECM is a novel method that learns optimal relaxation levels for equivariant neural networks automatically from training data, converging to values bounded by each layer's symmetry gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict equivariance constraints can hinder learning by creating complex optimization dynamics, while existing relaxation methods require costly task-dependent tuning of relaxation levels for each layer.

Method: Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM) - a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from training signals and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution.

Result: RECM provably converges to relaxation levels upper-bounded by each layer's symmetry gap, allowing symmetric distributions to maintain full equivariance while approximate symmetries retain flexibility. Empirically outperforms prior methods on exact and approximate equivariant tasks including molecular conformer generation.

Conclusion: RECM provides an automatic, theoretically-grounded approach to learning optimal equivariance relaxation that adapts to each layer's symmetry properties without requiring prior knowledge of task-dependent relaxation levels.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks exploit underlying task symmetries to improve generalization, but strict equivariance constraints can induce more complex optimization dynamics that can hinder learning. Prior work addresses these limitations by relaxing strict equivariance during training, but typically relies on prespecified, explicit, or implicit target levels of relaxation for each network layer, which are task-dependent and costly to tune. We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.

### [353] [When pre-training hurts LoRA fine-tuning: a dynamical analysis via single-index models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02855)
*Gibbs Nwemadji,Bruno Loureiro,Jean Barbier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pre-training can sometimes slow down fine-tuning optimization, contrary to intuition. The paper shows that excessive pre-training induces a prolonged search phase and hinders convergence in LoRA fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional wisdom that pre-training always facilitates fine-tuning on similar downstream tasks is challenged. The authors aim to mathematically demonstrate that excessive pre-training can actually slow down fine-tuning optimization, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between pre-training strength and fine-tuning efficiency.

Method: The study uses mathematical analysis of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The authors leverage a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics to characterize how convergence rate depends on initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task.

Result: The analysis reveals that even when pre-training and downstream tasks are well-aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. The theory provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The naive intuition that pre-training always facilitates fine-tuning is not always true. Excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization, and the relationship between pre-training strength and fine-tuning efficiency depends on task alignment and non-linearity in complex ways.

Abstract: Pre-training on a source task is usually expected to facilitate fine-tuning on similar downstream problems. In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.

### [354] [Late-Stage Generalization Collapse in Grokking: Detecting anti-grokking with Weightwatcher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02859)
*Hari K Prakash,Charles H Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a third phase in grokking called "anti-grokking" where models lose generalization after achieving it, and uses WeightWatcher's Correlation Traps to diagnose this phenomenon without test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of memorization in neural networks lacks precise definitions and relies on grokking observations. The authors discovered an unreported third phase where generalization collapses after being achieved, which existing diagnostics fail to capture.

Method: Extended training beyond standard grokking experiments on two canonical setups (3-layer MLP on MNIST subset and transformer on modular addition). Used WeightWatcher tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory to detect Correlation Traps (anomalously large eigenvalues) and layer quality metric α deviations.

Result: Identified anti-grokking phase where test accuracy collapses to chance while training accuracy remains perfect. Correlation Traps and α metric deviations successfully diagnose anti-grokking, while alternative metrics (ℓ₂ norms, activation sparsity, etc.) fail. Showed Correlation Traps can cause catastrophic forgetting and observed similar patterns in large LLMs.

Conclusion: Anti-grokking represents a distinct post-generalization failure mode. Correlation Traps provide a data-free diagnostic for this phenomenon, revealing fundamental limitations in neural network training dynamics that extend to large-scale models.

Abstract: \emph{Memorization} in neural networks lacks a precise operational definition and is often inferred from the grokking regime, where training accuracy saturates while test accuracy remains very low. We identify a previously unreported third phase of grokking in this training regime: \emph{anti-grokking}, a late-stage collapse of generalization.
  We revisit two canonical grokking setups: a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST and a transformer trained on modular addition, but extended training far beyond standard. In both cases, after models transition from pre-grokking to successful generalization, test accuracy collapses back to chance while training accuracy remains perfect, indicating a distinct post-generalization failure mode.
  To diagnose anti-grokking, we use the open-source \texttt{WeightWatcher} tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory. The primary signal is the emergence of \emph{Correlation Traps}: anomalously large eigenvalues beyond the Marchenko--Pastur bulk in the empirical spectral density of shuffled weight matrices, which are predicted to impair generalization. As a secondary signal, anti-grokking corresponds to the average HTSR layer quality metric $α$ deviating from $2.0$. Neither metric requires access to the test or training data.
  We compare these signals to alternative grokking diagnostic, including $\ell_2$ norms, Activation Sparsity, Absolute Weight Entropy, and Local Circuit Complexity. These track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to identify anti-grokking. Finally, we show that Correlation Traps can induce catastrophic forgetting and/or prototype memorization, and observe similar pathologies in large-scale LLMs, like OSS GPT 20/120B.

*Xiyuan Wei,Linli Zhou,Bokun Wang,Chih-Jen Lin,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCENT is a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm for compositional entropic risk minimization that uses stochastic proximal mirror descent with exponential Bregman divergence to achieve O(1/√T) convergence and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization algorithms for compositional entropic risk minimization (Log-E-Exp functions) suffer from non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates, despite their importance in many ML problems like extreme classification and contrastive learning.

Method: Proposed SCENT algorithm uses stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD) with Bregman divergence induced by negative exponential function to capture the geometry of the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization, framed as a min-min optimization problem.

Result: Theoretical: O(1/√T) convergence rate for convex problems and characterization of SPMD advantages over standard SGD. Empirical: Outperforms baselines on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning, and distributionally robust optimization.

Conclusion: SCENT addresses fundamental limitations of existing methods for compositional entropic risk minimization through geometry-aware stochastic optimization with exponential Bregman divergence, achieving both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization for a family of problems termed $\textbf{compositional entropic risk minimization}$, in which each data's loss is formulated as a Log-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp) function. The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: M-CBEs generalize concept bottleneck models with mixture of experts, offering flexible accuracy-interpretability trade-offs through linear or symbolic expert functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs are limited by fixed linear/Boolean predictors, restricting accuracy and adaptability to diverse user needs. There's an underexplored design space for more flexible concept-based models.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs) with two instantiations: Linear M-CBE (finite set of linear expressions) and Symbolic M-CBE (symbolic regression with user-specified operator vocabularies).

Result: Varying mixture size and functional form provides robust framework for navigating accuracy-interpretability trade-off, adapting to different user and task needs.

Conclusion: M-CBEs generalize existing CBMs and expose new design possibilities, offering flexible concept-based models that balance interpretability with improved accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) promote interpretability by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs typically fix their task predictor to a single linear or Boolean expression, limiting both predictive accuracy and adaptability to diverse user needs. We propose Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs), a framework that generalizes existing CBMs along two dimensions: the number of experts and the functional form of each expert, exposing an underexplored region of the design space. We investigate this region by instantiating two novel models: Linear M-CBE, which learns a finite set of linear expressions, and Symbolic M-CBE, which leverages symbolic regression to discover expert functions from data under user-specified operator vocabularies. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that varying the mixture size and functional form provides a robust framework for navigating the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, adapting to different user and task needs.

*Anthony Fuller,James R. Green,Evan Shelhamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-Souping extends model soups to self-supervised learning, enabling parameter mixing from diverse SSL algorithms and data sources to improve robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model soups require supervised learning and optimize the same loss on labeled data, limiting their applicability. The authors want to generalize soups to self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data for transfer learning and robustness improvements.

Method: Self-Souping takes a base model, fine-tunes it into multiple ingredients using different SSL algorithms (MAE, MoCoV3, MMCR) and hyperparameters, then mixes their parameters back into one model. They also propose a novel approach of Self-Souping on corrupted test data followed by fine-tuning on uncorrupted train data.

Result: Self-Souping boosts robustness by +3.5% on ImageNet-C and +7% on LAION-C. It enables soups combining different SSL algorithms (MAE, MoCoV3, MMCR) that outperform any single SSL ingredient. The method shows ingredients can differ in both SSL hyperparameters and algorithms.

Conclusion: Self-Souping successfully extends model soups to self-supervised learning, unlocking diverse SSL algorithms for creating more robust models. It demonstrates that mixing parameters from different SSL approaches can yield better performance than any single approach alone.

Abstract: Model soups are strange and strangely effective combinations of parameters. They take a model (the stock), fine-tune it into multiple models (the ingredients), and then mix their parameters back into one model (the soup) to improve predictions. While all known soups require supervised learning, and optimize the same loss on labeled data, our recipes for Self-\emph{Soup}ervision generalize soups to self-supervised learning (SSL). Our Self-Souping lets us flavor ingredients on new data sources, e.g. from unlabeled data from a task for transfer or from a shift for robustness. We show that Self-Souping on corrupted test data, then fine-tuning back on uncorrupted train data, boosts robustness by +3.5\% (ImageNet-C) and +7\% (LAION-C). Self-\emph{Soup}ervision also unlocks countless SSL algorithms to cook the diverse ingredients needed for more robust soups. We show for the first time that ingredients can differ in their SSL hyperparameters -- and more surprisingly, in their SSL algorithms. We cook soups of MAE, MoCoV3, and MMCR ingredients that are more accurate than any one single SSL ingredient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TraceNAS is a training-free Neural Architecture Search framework that efficiently identifies optimal structured pruning configurations for LLMs by maintaining loss landscape alignment with pretrained models, achieving competitive performance with training-aware methods at 10× lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structured pruning methods for LLMs evaluate importance of components in isolation, ignoring global structural dependencies. Training-aware methods capture these dependencies but are computationally expensive, creating a need for efficient methods that consider global dependencies without heavy training costs.

Method: TraceNAS uses a training-free NAS framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. It employs a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy to identify pruned models that maintain high loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model, effectively selecting models with maximal performance potential during post-pruning training.

Result: TraceNAS enables high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, achieving 10× reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on Llama and Qwen families show competitive performance with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TraceNAS provides an efficient, training-free approach to structured pruning that captures global structural dependencies while significantly reducing computational costs, making it a practical solution for deploying efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Structured pruning is essential for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The varying sensitivity of LLM sub-blocks to pruning necessitates the identification of optimal non-uniformly pruned models. Existing methods evaluate the importance of layers, attention heads, or weight channels in isolation. Such localized focus ignores the complex global structural dependencies that exist across the model. Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: DSGD-AC intentionally preserves consensus errors as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima, outperforming both standard DSGD and centralized SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional view that consensus errors in decentralized training undermine convergence and generalization, proposing instead that they can serve as beneficial implicit regularization.

Method: Decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC) uses a time-dependent scaling mechanism to intentionally preserve non-vanishing consensus errors that systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace.

Result: DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness across image classification and machine translation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Consensus errors can serve as useful implicit regularizers, opening new perspectives for designing decentralized learning algorithms that leverage structured perturbations for better generalization.

Abstract: Decentralized training is often regarded as inferior to centralized training because the consensus errors between workers are thought to undermine convergence and generalization, even with homogeneous data distributions. This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness. Together, these results establish consensus errors as a useful implicit regularizer and open a new perspective on the design of decentralized learning algorithms.

*Zeyu Fang,Zuyuan Zhang,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC-ETM improves offline RL robustness by learning energy-based transition models with manifold constraints, using energy signals to detect OOD states and apply pessimistic penalties during policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based offline RL suffers from distribution shift where policy improvement drives rollouts into weakly supported state-action regions, causing compounding model error and severe value overestimation.

Method: Trains conditional energy-based transition models using manifold projection-diffusion negative sampler; learns latent manifold of next states, generates near-manifold hard negatives via latent Langevin dynamics; uses learned energy as reliability signal for rollout truncation and pessimistic Q-value penalties.

Result: Improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.

Conclusion: MC-ETM addresses offline RL distribution shift through energy-based modeling with manifold constraints, providing effective reliability signals for safe policy optimization with formal performance guarantees.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning is brittle under distribution shift: policy improvement drives rollouts into state--action regions weakly supported by the dataset, where compounding model error yields severe value overestimation. We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk. Empirically, MC-ETM improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.

Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for traffic signal control struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency, requiring better approaches for optimizing network-wide traffic flow through coordinated intersection control.

Method: MADT extends Decision Transformer to multi-agent settings with: (1) graph attention mechanism for spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) temporal transformer encoder for traffic dynamics, (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification, enabling offline learning from historical data.

Result: MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic grid networks and real-world scenarios, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to strongest baselines while showing superior coordination among adjacent intersections.

Conclusion: MADT successfully addresses multi-agent coordination challenges in traffic signal control through sequence modeling approach, demonstrating effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for offline learning with potential for online fine-tuning.

Abstract: Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.

*Binxu Wang,Jacob Zavatone-Veth,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models trained on different data splits produce similar outputs due to shared Gaussian statistics, explained by random matrix theory showing how finite datasets shape denoiser expectations and variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why diffusion models trained on different, non-overlapping subsets of a dataset produce strikingly similar outputs when given the same noise seed, and to develop a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training.

Method: Developed a random matrix theory (RMT) framework to quantify how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of learned denoisers and sampling maps in linear settings. Used deterministic-equivalence tools extended to fractional matrix powers to analyze entire sampling trajectories.

Result: The theory shows that sampling variability acts as a renormalization of noise level through a self-consistent relation, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward dataset mean. Variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: anisotropy across eigenmodes, inhomogeneity across inputs, and scaling with dataset size.

Conclusion: The RMT framework sharply predicts linear diffusion model behavior and was validated on UNet and DiT architectures in non-memorization regimes, identifying where/how samples deviate across training splits. This provides a principled baseline linking spectral data properties to generative output stability.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on different, non-overlapping subsets of a dataset often produce strikingly similar outputs when given the same noise seed. We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $σ^2 \mapsto κ(σ^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split. This provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking spectral properties of data to the stability of generative outputs.

### [363] [Notes on the Reward Representation of Posterior Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02912)
*Pedro A. Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows when decision-making as inference can be made literal rather than metaphorical, specifically when KL-regularized soft updates correspond exactly to Bayesian posteriors in a fixed probabilistic model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when the common metaphor of "decision-making as inference" can be made mathematically precise, moving from metaphorical to literal Bayesian inference in control and reinforcement learning frameworks.

Method: Study the special case where KL-regularized soft updates are exactly Bayesian posteriors within a single fixed probabilistic model, analyzing when behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried through genuine information channels.

Result: Posterior updates determine relative, context-dependent incentive signals but not absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Coherence constraints emerge when requiring reusable continuation values across different update directions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a sharp identification result showing that while posterior updates reveal relative incentive structures, absolute rewards remain underdetermined, with additional coherence constraints needed for consistent reward descriptions across different conditioning orders.

Abstract: Many ideas in modern control and reinforcement learning treat decision-making as inference: start from a baseline distribution and update it when a signal arrives. We ask when this can be made literal rather than metaphorical. We study the special case where a KL-regularized soft update is exactly a Bayesian posterior inside a single fixed probabilistic model, so the update variable is a genuine channel through which information is transmitted. In this regime, behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried by that channel: the update must be explainable as an evidence reweighing of the baseline. This yields a sharp identification result: posterior updates determine the relative, context-dependent incentive signal that shifts behavior, but they do not uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Requiring one reusable continuation value across different update directions adds a further coherence constraint linking the reward descriptions associated with different conditioning orders.

TL;DR: A training strategy that learns biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over time to address sparse clinical labels in PPG-based health monitoring, improving accuracy and providing interpretable temporal sensitivity insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse clinical labels make biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision in health monitoring algorithms using PPG data from wearables.

Method: Introduces a training strategy that learns biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between PPG segments and their ground truth labels, using this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions.

Result: On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines: 0.715 AUPRC vs 0.674 for fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for feature-based Random Forest. Linear decay function is most robust.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses label sparsity in PPG-based health monitoring, improves biomarker prediction accuracy, and provides interpretable decay rates showing how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale.

Abstract: Advances in wearable computing and AI have increased interest in leveraging PPG for health monitoring over the past decade. One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALGD is a novel diffusion-based safe RL algorithm that uses augmented Lagrangian to stabilize policy generation and training in online settings, addressing instability issues in existing primal-dual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL methods focus mainly on offline reward maximization with limited safety considerations in online settings. There's a gap in applying diffusion policies to safe RL, and primal-dual methods suffer from instability due to non-convex Lagrangian landscapes in diffusion-based approaches.

Method: ALGD introduces an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, interpreting the Lagrangian as an energy function guiding denoising dynamics. This stabilization approach doesn't alter the optimal policy distribution while resolving instability in both policy generation and training.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate ALGD achieves strong and stable performance across diverse environments, showing it's both theoretically grounded and empirically effective for safe RL.

Conclusion: ALGD successfully addresses the stability issues in diffusion-based safe RL by leveraging augmented Lagrangian theory, providing a robust solution for online safe reinforcement learning with diffusion policies.

Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.

TL;DR: SDA2E: Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder with similarity-guided active learning for detecting rare anomalies in imbalanced datasets like APTs, achieving superior ranking with 80% less labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies (like APTs) in highly imbalanced datasets is challenging. Active learning can reduce labeling effort, but conventional approaches fail to exploit geometric structure of feature space for model refinement.

Method: SDA2E (Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder) learns compact discriminative latent representations. A similarity-guided active learning framework with three strategies: normal-like expansion, anomaly-like prioritization, and hybrid strategy. Uses SIM_NM1 similarity measure for sparse binary embeddings.

Result: Evaluated on 52 imbalanced datasets including DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios. Superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0), reduces required labeled data by up to 80% vs passive training. Statistical tests confirm significance.

Conclusion: Establishes robust, efficient, statistically validated framework for anomaly detection suited to cybersecurity applications like APT detection.

Abstract: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets-such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity-remains a fundamental challenge for machine learning systems. Active learning offers a promising direction by strategically querying an oracle to minimize labeling effort, yet conventional approaches often fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for model refinement. In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training. Statistical tests confirm the significance of these improvements. Our work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection.

*Zimo Wang,Ishit Mehta,Haolin Lu,Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Tsui-Wei Weng,Tzu-Mao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distance Marching improves time-unconditional generative models by using distance field modeling and focusing on closer denoising targets, achieving better FID scores with fewer sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-unconditional generative models face interference because the same noisy input can correspond to multiple noise levels and different denoising directions, which confuses the supervision signal.

Method: Proposes Distance Marching with distance field modeling, principled inference methods, and losses that focus on closer targets to yield denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold.

Result: Consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet, surpasses flow matching with 60% sampling steps and 13.6% lower average FID across backbone sizes.

Conclusion: Distance field modeling provides a principled approach for generative modeling, with distance prediction also useful for early stopping during sampling and OOD detection.

Abstract: Time-unconditional generative models learn time-independent denoising vector fields. But without time conditioning, the same noisy input may correspond to multiple noise levels and different denoising directions, which interferes with the supervision signal. Inspired by distance field modeling, we propose Distance Marching, a new time-unconditional approach with two principled inference methods. Crucially, we design losses that focus on closer targets. This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic framework combining Graph Autoencoder with rare pattern mining for detecting APT activities in system provenance data, outperforming existing unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APT attacks are sophisticated and stealthy, blending into normal system behavior, making them difficult to detect with traditional methods. There's a need for more effective anomaly detection approaches that can identify subtle, long-term attack patterns in system-level provenance data.

Method: 1. Construct process behavioral graph using k-NN based on feature similarity. 2. Learn normal relational structure using Graph Autoencoder (GAE). 3. Identify anomaly candidates through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. 4. Integrate rare pattern mining module to discover infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures.

Result: The method was evaluated on DARPA Transparent Computing datasets. Rare-pattern boosting yielded substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over baseline GAE. The single unified model consistently outperformed individual context-based detectors and achieved performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors.

Conclusion: Coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining improves both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection. The neuro-symbolic approach demonstrates value in detecting sophisticated APT-like activities by combining the strengths of neural networks and symbolic pattern mining.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new publicly available dataset for post-trauma sepsis onset detection, addressing limitations in existing sepsis datasets that treat ICU patients uniformly and ignore trauma-specific challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sepsis datasets fail to account for trauma patients where injury-related inflammation overlaps with sepsis symptoms, making early detection challenging. A targeted approach for post-traumatic sepsis is needed.

Method: Created a standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset from MIMIC-III, relabeled using standardized clinical facts. Framed early detection as a daily rare event detection problem aligned with ICU clinical workflow.

Result: Established a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments showing the dataset's utility and highlighting the need for further advancements in post-trauma sepsis detection.

Conclusion: The new dataset addresses a critical gap in sepsis research by focusing on trauma patients, enabling better early detection methods and providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Sepsis is a major public health concern due to its high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset. The data code is available at https://github.com/ML4UWHealth/SepsisOnset_TraumaCohort.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework called 3D-Learning (Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning) improves OOD generalization in Predict-then-Optimize systems by using diffusion models to find worst-case distributions for robust ML training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predict-then-Optimize pipelines in computing systems (cloud LLM serving, data center demand response, etc.) suffer from performance degradation when ML predictors encounter out-of-distribution samples at test time. Traditional methods don't adequately address OOD generalization challenges.

Method: Proposes DR-DFL framework that trains ML models to optimize decision performance under worst-case distribution. Instead of classical DRO, introduces 3D-Learning which searches for worst-case distributions within diffusion model's parameterized space, leveraging diffusion models' powerful distribution modeling capabilities.

Result: Empirical results on LLM resource provisioning task show 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance. Achieves favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios by identifying worst-case distributions consistent with real data.

Conclusion: 3D-Learning effectively addresses OOD generalization challenges in Predict-then-Optimize systems by combining diffusion models with distributionally robust optimization, providing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Predict-then-Optimize (PTO) pipelines are widely employed in computing and networked systems, where Machine Learning (ML) models are used to predict critical contextual information for downstream decision-making tasks such as cloud LLM serving, data center demand response, and edge workload scheduling. However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios. Empirical results on an LLM resource provisioning task demonstrate that 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems require not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty quantification. Many applications need fast inference with uncertainty estimates, which remains challenging.

Method: Propose Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) with two VAEs: one encoding observations and another encoding quantities of interest, connected via learned latent mapping. Uses sparse encodings to concentrate information into identifiable factors. Introduces hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity.

Result: Experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography demonstrate vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that provides interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: vsPAIR effectively addresses the challenge of providing both fast inference and interpretable uncertainty quantification for inverse problems through its paired sparse variational architecture.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.
  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.

TL;DR: QVG is a training-free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models that reduces memory usage by up to 7x with minimal latency overhead while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory in autoregressive video diffusion models grows with generation history, exceeding 30GB and preventing deployment on widely available hardware. Constrained KV cache budgets also degrade long-horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion.

Method: QVG uses Semantic Aware Smoothing to leverage video spatiotemporal redundancy and produce low-magnitude, quantization-friendly residuals. It also introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse-to-fine multi-stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling smooth quality-memory trade-offs.

Result: Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end-to-end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

Conclusion: QVG effectively addresses the KV cache memory bottleneck in autoregressive video diffusion models, enabling deployment on more accessible hardware while maintaining generation quality and long-horizon consistency.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

TL;DR: MA2B-DDQN is a human-centric multi-agent DRL framework for traffic signal coordination that optimizes traveler-level equity using action-branching to handle high-dimensional discrete control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent DRL approaches for traffic signal coordination are vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces, failing to account for all traveler types (pedestrians, vehicle occupants, transit passengers) and equity considerations.

Method: Proposes MA2B-DDQN with action-branching discrete control that decomposes corridor control into: (1) local per-intersection actions allocating green time between next two phases, and (2) a single global action selecting total duration of those phases. Uses human-centric reward penalizing number of delayed individuals across all traveler types.

Result: Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne show significant reduction in impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Model demonstrates robustness with minimal variance across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The framework provides a fairer, scalable traffic signal system adaptable to varied urban conditions by explicitly optimizing traveler-level equity through human-centric multi-agent DRL with action-branching control decomposition.

Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Machine Learning promises computational advantages but faces data privacy challenges. Classical differential privacy methods like DP-SGD don't exploit unique quantum gradient properties, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs in QML.

Method: Q-ShiftDP leverages the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule. It combines carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy guarantees while reducing noise requirements through tighter sensitivity analysis.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML, demonstrating improved privacy-utility trade-offs by harnessing quantum noise.

Conclusion: Q-ShiftDP represents the first tailored privacy mechanism for QML that exploits quantum-specific properties, offering better privacy guarantees and utility than classical approaches by combining calibrated noise with intrinsic quantum noise.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, but preserving training data privacy remains challenging. Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off.

*Shrenik Patel,Christine Truong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co2PO is a communication-augmented MARL framework that uses risk-aware communication and hazard prediction to enable safe multi-agent coordination without sacrificing exploration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained MARL approaches (like Lagrangian methods) rely on reactive constraints that suppress exploration and lead to over-conservatism. They use global penalties or centralized critics that only respond to violations after they occur, creating a fundamental tension between exploration and safety.

Method: Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals. It uses a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over extended temporal horizons. The framework integrates these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, enabling agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards through selective, risk-aware communication.

Result: Co2PO achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines across complex multi-agent safety benchmarks while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.

Conclusion: Co2PO successfully addresses the exploration-safety trade-off in constrained MARL by enabling coordination-driven safety through proactive hazard prediction and selective communication, outperforming traditional reactive constraint methods.

Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces a fundamental tension between exploration and safety-constrained optimization. Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.

### [377] [Why Some Models Resist Unlearning: A Linear Stability Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02986)
*Wei-Kai Chang,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical framework for machine unlearning using asymptotic linear stability, showing that data coherence (alignment of loss surface directions) determines unlearning success, with lower signal-to-noise ratios making forgetting easier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most machine unlearning research has been empirical without theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. The paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a principled theoretical framework for understanding unlearning dynamics.

Method: Frames unlearning through asymptotic linear stability to capture optimization dynamics and data geometry. Analyzes data coherence decomposed along three axes (retain set, forget set, between them) and proves tight stability thresholds. Studies a two-layer ReLU CNN under signal-plus-noise model to link data properties to forgettability.

Result: Shows that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: lower signal-to-noise ratio reduces coherence and makes unlearning easier, while high SNR models resist unlearning. Empirical verification shows Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align with predicted stability boundaries for gradient-based unlearning.

Conclusion: Provides the first principled theoretical account of trade-offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning using random matrix theory tools, establishing data coherence as the key determinant of unlearning success.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the ability to erase the effect of specific training samples without retraining from scratch, is critical for privacy, regulation, and efficiency. However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning.

TL;DR: NLI is a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal framework for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions in LLMs, achieving 4x computational efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have large memory and computational costs, and while linear layers have been compressed effectively, nonlinear layers (SiLU, RMSNorm, Softmax) still rely on expensive high-precision floating-point operations, creating a bottleneck for efficient deployment.

Method: Proposes Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI) framework that formulates cutpoint selection as a dynamic programming problem, achieving globally minimal interpolation error in O(M×N²) time using Bellman's optimality principle. Also designs a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit based on NLI.

Result: NLI enables seamless integration into LLMs and deep neural networks with almost no accuracy loss. Hardware experiments show the NLI Engine achieves over 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art designs.

Conclusion: NLI provides an efficient, hardware-friendly solution for approximating nonlinear functions in LLMs, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, addressing a key bottleneck in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APRIL dataset enables supervised learning for Lean proof repair using compiler feedback, improving repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Lean datasets lack supervision for understanding and repairing proof failures, which is critical as neural theorem provers become more agentic and need to interpret compiler feedback.

Method: Introduce APRIL dataset with 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics, aligned repair and explanation targets. Train language models on this dataset for proof repair.

Result: Finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms strongest open-source baseline in single-shot repair evaluation, substantially improving repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning.

Conclusion: Diagnostic-conditioned supervision provides complementary training signal for feedback-using provers, and the APRIL dataset enables better proof repair in Lean.

Abstract: As neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers. Our dataset is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/APRIL}{this link}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive batch size strategies for non-Euclidean optimizers (signSGD/Signum and specSGD/Muon) by deriving gradient noise scales from their respective dual norms and developing efficient variance estimation for distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML systems use brittle heuristics for batch size tuning that are costly to optimize. Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale assume Euclidean geometry, creating a mismatch with popular non-Euclidean optimizers like signSGD and specSGD.

Method: Derived gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD from their respective dual norms (ℓ∞ and S∞). Proposed efficient variance estimation procedure leveraging local mini-batch gradients across different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems.

Result: Adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS matched validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160M parameter Llama model.

Conclusion: The work provides principled adaptive batch size strategies for non-Euclidean optimizers, enabling more efficient training by leveraging the natural geometry of these optimizers rather than relying on Euclidean assumptions.

Abstract: To maximize hardware utilization, modern machine learning systems typically employ large constant or manually tuned batch size schedules, relying on heuristics that are brittle and costly to tune. Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) offer a principled alternative. However, their assumption of SGD's Euclidean geometry creates a fundamental mismatch with popular optimizers based on generalized norms, such as signSGD / Signum ($\ell_\infty$) and stochastic spectral descent (specSGD) / Muon ($\mathcal{S}_\infty$). In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE) for industrial process monitoring, combining correlation graph learning with causal discovery and spatial-temporal reconstruction for improved reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring by incorporating causal relationships rather than just correlations, enabling better fault detection and understanding of process dynamics.

Method: Combines spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) for correlation graph learning with a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm that uses reverse causal invariance principle. Uses graph convolutional LSTM (GCLSTM) in spatial-temporal encoder-decoder for sequence-to-sequence reconstruction.

Result: Validated on Tennessee Eastman process and real-world air separation process, showing effective process monitoring and fault detection through feature space and residual space statistics.

Conclusion: CGSTAE successfully integrates causal discovery with spatial-temporal modeling for more reliable and interpretable industrial process monitoring, demonstrating practical effectiveness on both benchmark and real-world processes.

Abstract: To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.

TL;DR: OUTFORMER advances foundation models for outlier detection with synthetic priors and self-evolving curriculum training, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks with fast, zero-shot inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outlier detection deployment is hindered by lack of labeled outliers, making algorithm and hyperparameter selection difficult. While foundation models have transformed ML, existing approaches still face challenges in practical deployment.

Method: Builds upon FoMo-0D with two key innovations: (1) mixture of synthetic priors for pretraining, and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. Pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets, uses in-context learning with training data as input for zero-shot inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AdBench and two new large-scale OD benchmarks comprising over 1,500 datasets. Maintains speedy inference with plug-and-play deployment requiring no additional training or model selection.

Conclusion: OUTFORMER enables truly plug-and-play outlier detection with zero-shot inference, eliminating the need for labeled outliers, model training, or bespoke model selection while achieving superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is widely used in practice; but its effective deployment on new tasks is hindered by lack of labeled outliers, which makes algorithm and hyperparameter selection notoriously hard. Foundation models (FMs) have transformed ML, and OD is no exception: Shen et. al. (2025) introduced FoMo-0D, the first FM for OD, achieving remarkable performance against numerous baselines. This work introduces OUTFORMER, which advances FoMo-0D with (1) a mixture of synthetic priors and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment. OUTFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the prominent AdBench, as well as two new large-scale OD benchmarks that we introduce, comprising over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining speedy inference.

### [383] [FedKRSO: Communication and Memory Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03019)
*Guohao Yang,Tongle Wu,Yuanxiong Guo,Ying Sun,Yanmin Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedKRSO enables efficient full fine-tuning of LLMs in federated learning by using shared random low-dimensional subspaces, reducing communication and memory costs while maintaining performance close to full federated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for LLM fine-tuning faces challenges with high communication costs (transmitting full parameters) and memory constraints (computing full gradients). While PEFT methods reduce costs, they sacrifice performance compared to full fine-tuning (FFT). There's a need for a method that achieves FFT performance with PEFT-like efficiency.

Method: FedKRSO uses K random low-dimensional subspaces generated by the server. Clients update models within these shared subspaces to save memory. Instead of transmitting full parameters, clients send only model update accumulators along the subspaces. This enables efficient global aggregation and dissemination while maintaining FFT-like optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios show FedKRSO achieves superior performance with low communication and memory overhead, closely approximating federated FFT performance while overcoming PEFT limitations.

Conclusion: FedKRSO provides an effective solution for resource-constrained federated LLM fine-tuning by enabling communication and memory efficient FFT, paving the way for practical LLM deployment at the edge while preserving privacy through federated learning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) offer infinite-depth networks with constant memory but suffer from significant inference latency due to iterative fixed-point solvers.

Method: C-DEQ leverages consistency distillation by casting DEQ iterative inference as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory, training the model to consistently map intermediate states directly to the equilibrium point.

Result: C-DEQs achieve consistent 2-20× accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget across various domain tasks.

Conclusion: C-DEQ enables few-step inference while preserving teacher DEQ performance and facilitates flexible computation-performance trade-offs through multi-step evaluation.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, offering the ability to model infinite-depth networks with constant memory usage. However, DEQs incur significant inference latency due to the iterative nature of fixed-point solvers. In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE-KD is a universal multi-exit wrapper for vision backbones that combines hierarchical distillation with conformal risk control to provide guaranteed risk bounds for early exit decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks reduce inference cost but lack reliable criteria for determining when early exit is safe, requiring a method that provides formal guarantees on exit decisions.

Method: Attaches lightweight exit heads at intermediate depths, uses Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) to transfer teacher knowledge to all exits, enforces deep-to-shallow consistency, and calibrates per-exit stopping thresholds using conformal risk control on a held-out set.

Result: Across multiple datasets and architectures, SAFE-KD achieves improved accuracy-compute trade-offs, stronger calibration, robust performance under corruption, and provides finite-sample risk guarantees for selective misclassification risk.

Conclusion: SAFE-KD provides a principled approach to early-exit networks with formal risk guarantees, making early exit decisions reliable and deployable in practice while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Early-exit networks reduce inference cost by allowing ``easy'' inputs to stop early, but practical deployment hinges on knowing \emph{when} early exit is safe. We introduce SAFE-KD, a universal multi-exit wrapper for modern vision backbones that couples hierarchical distillation with \emph{conformal risk control}. SAFE-KD attaches lightweight exit heads at intermediate depths, distills a strong teacher into all exits via Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), and enforces deep-to-shallow consistency between exits. At inference, we calibrate per-exit stopping thresholds on a held-out set using conformal risk control (CRC) to guarantee a user-specified \emph{selective} misclassification risk (among the samples that exit early) under exchangeability. Across multiple datasets and architectures, SAFE-KD yields improved accuracy compute trade-offs, stronger calibration, and robust performance under corruption while providing finite-sample risk guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCAD: A proactive agentic framework for text-to-CAD generation that resolves ambiguous prompts through clarification questions before code synthesis, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-CAD systems struggle with under-specified or inconsistent geometric descriptions in natural language prompts, causing models to hallucinate dimensions and produce invalid CAD programs.

Method: Two-agent framework: 1) Proactive clarifying agent audits prompts and asks targeted clarification questions when needed to produce self-consistent specifications, 2) CAD coding agent translates specifications into executable CadQuery programs. Agents are trained via fine-tuning on curated datasets and agentic SFT.

Result: ProCAD significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts with low interaction overhead, outperforming frontier models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 by reducing mean Chamfer distance by 79.9% and lowering invalidity ratio from 4.8% to 0.9%.

Conclusion: Proactive clarification before code synthesis effectively addresses specification issues in text-to-CAD generation, enabling more reliable and accurate CAD program synthesis from natural language prompts.

Abstract: Large language models have recently enabled text-to-CAD systems that synthesize parametric CAD programs (e.g., CadQuery) from natural language prompts. In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homotopy methods are widely used across domains but rely on suboptimal, task-specific hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and termination criteria in predictor-corrector schemes.

Method: Unify homotopy problems under a single framework, formulate policy selection as sequential decision-making, use reinforcement learning to learn efficient strategies, and introduce amortized training for generalization across problem instances.

Result: NPC generalizes effectively to unseen instances, outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency, and shows superior stability across four representative homotopy problems.

Conclusion: The neural framework successfully unifies homotopy methods, demonstrating the value of replacing hand-crafted heuristics with learned policies for improved efficiency and stability across diverse optimization problems.

Abstract: The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL frameworks like GRPO use uniform rollout budgets, causing resource inefficiency. Existing adaptive methods rely on instance-level metrics that fail to capture the model's dynamic learning state, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: CoBA-RL uses a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to potential training gains, and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate computational resource distribution to high-value samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoBA-RL effectively balances exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are crucial for advancing LLM post-training efficiency, as demonstrated by CoBA-RL's success.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time scaling approaches that optimize high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency because many search directions have negligible influence on final generation. This inefficiency is related to spectral bias in generative dynamics where model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly with increasing frequency.

Method: Proposes Spectral Evolution Search (SES) - a gradient-free evolutionary search framework that operates within a low-frequency subspace of initial noise. The method is based on the Spectral Scaling Prediction derived from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains systematic differences in perturbation impact across frequencies.

Result: SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SES provides an efficient plug-and-play framework for inference-time scaling that leverages spectral bias in generative dynamics to optimize initial noise in low-frequency subspace, achieving better quality-cost tradeoffs than existing methods.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling offers a versatile paradigm for aligning visual generative models with downstream objectives without parameter updates. However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

### [392] [Evaluating LLMs When They Do Not Know the Answer: Statistical Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning via Comparative Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03061)
*Zihan Dong,Zhixian Zhang,Yang Zhou,Can Jin,Ruijia Wu,Linjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A statistically efficient evaluation framework for LLMs that uses pairwise comparison signals from auxiliary reasoning chains to reduce variance and improve ranking stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs suffers from high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings due to limited benchmark sizes and model stochasticity. Even when models fail to produce correct final answers, they can still provide reliable signals about which of two candidate solutions is better.

Method: The framework combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. These comparison signals are treated as control variates, and a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) is developed, yielding a one-step estimator that achieves semiparametric efficiency bound.

Result: The one-step estimator guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification, substantially improves ranking accuracy (with gains increasing as model output noise grows), and demonstrates more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings across GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework provides statistically efficient assessment of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, offering more stable rankings and precise performance estimates, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is unstable.

Abstract: Evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs is constrained by limited benchmark sizes and inherent model stochasticity, yielding high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings across platforms. On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable.

*Jinwoo Lim,Suhyun Kim,Soo-Mook Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcut learning in neural networks is analyzed using Neural Tangent Kernel theory, showing that shortcut features correspond to larger eigenvalues and maintain influence even after training, with max-margin bias not being the sole cause.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental mechanisms behind shortcut learning in deep learning models, where networks prefer to learn dominant but non-generalizable features from imbalanced training data, using theoretical analysis to uncover why this happens and persists.

Method: Used Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework to analyze linear neural networks, defining features as eigenfunctions of NTK. Examined shortcut features in imbalanced clustered distributions, showing they correspond to larger eigenvalues. Extended analysis to two-layer ReLU networks and ResNet-18 for empirical validation.

Result: Found that shortcut features have larger eigenvalues in imbalanced clustered distributions, and these features maintain significant influence on network output even after training due to data variances. Demonstrated that shortcut learning persists even when controlling output margins, indicating max-margin bias is not the only cause.

Conclusion: Shortcut learning in neural networks is fundamentally linked to eigenvalue structure of NTK, with shortcut features corresponding to larger eigenvalues that remain influential post-training. This provides theoretical understanding beyond just max-margin bias explanations, with findings generalizing to more complex architectures.

Abstract: One of the chronic problems of deep-learning models is shortcut learning. In a case where the majority of training data are dominated by a certain feature, neural networks prefer to learn such a feature even if the feature is not generalizable outside the training set. Based on the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we analyzed the case of linear neural networks to derive some important properties of shortcut learning. We defined a feature of a neural network as an eigenfunction of NTK. Then, we found that shortcut features correspond to features with larger eigenvalues when the shortcuts stem from the imbalanced number of samples in the clustered distribution. We also showed that the features with larger eigenvalues still have a large influence on the neural network output even after training, due to data variances in the clusters. Such a preference for certain features remains even when a margin of a neural network output is controlled, which shows that the max-margin bias is not the only major reason for shortcut learning. These properties of linear neural networks are empirically extended for more complex neural networks as a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network and a ResNet-18.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSinkhorn: An IO-aware EOT solver using FlashAttention-style fusion for 32× faster forward-pass and 161× end-to-end speedups over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU solvers for entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations remain inefficient at scale due to quadratic HBM traffic from dense interactions and limited fusion in existing implementations.

Method: Rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores (same as transformer attention), enabling FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling with fused Triton kernels that stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass.

Result: Achieves up to 32× forward-pass and 161× end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT on A100 GPUs, with improved scalability on OT-based downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FlashSinkhorn provides an efficient, IO-aware EOT solver that substantially reduces HBM IO while retaining linear-memory operations, enabling scalable optimization for OT-based applications.

Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations is widely used in modern machine learning, yet GPU solvers remain inefficient at scale. Tensorized implementations suffer quadratic HBM traffic from dense $n\times m$ interactions, while existing online backends avoid storing dense matrices but still rely on generic tiled map-reduce reduction kernels with limited fusion. We present \textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\times$ forward-pass and $161\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we release an open-source implementation at https://github.com/ot-triton-lab/ot_triton.

*Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan,Zijie Liu,Zhen Tan,Charles Fleming,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TMS is a reward-free framework that approximates RL benefits by using historical checkpoints to create dynamic supervision, reducing policy-label divergence and catastrophic forgetting in SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between RL (good retention but expensive/complex) and SFT (efficient but brittle with catastrophic forgetting due to supervision mismatch between evolving policy and static labels).

Method: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS) - creates dynamic curriculum from model's own historical checkpoints to minimize Policy-Label Divergence (PLD), preventing mode collapse without requiring reward models or verifiers.

Result: TMS outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridges gap to RL without reward engineering, shifts accuracy-retention Pareto frontier on reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: TMS effectively addresses SFT's forgetting problem by approximating RL's on-policy benefits reward-free, with PLD drift predicting forgetting and TMS successfully mitigating this drift.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.

TL;DR: CaRE is a scalable continual learner using Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts (BR-MoE) to handle very long task sequences in class-incremental learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across hundreds of tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods struggle to effectively learn discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences, especially in class-incremental learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes CaRE with Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts (BR-MoE): 1) router selection stage dynamically activates task-specific routers, 2) expert routing phase dynamically activates and aggregates experts to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer.

Result: CaRE demonstrates leading performance across various datasets and task settings, including classical CIL settings (5-20 tasks) and is the first continual learner to scale to very long task sequences (100-300+ non-overlapping tasks), outperforming all baselines by large margins.

Conclusion: CaRE successfully addresses the challenge of continual learning over very long task sequences through its scalable BR-MoE architecture, establishing new state-of-the-art performance and introducing a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for geometry-aware neural architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, with universal approximation guarantees for constrained neural ODEs and learned projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving geometric structure is important in machine learning, especially for problems involving manifolds and constrained spaces. Existing approaches need better integration of geometric constraints throughout neural network architectures.

Method: Proposes a class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, treating both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds. Also introduces learning projections via small-time heat-kernel limits when constraint sets are unknown.

Result: Establishes universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. Shows architectures enforcing geometry only at output also have universal approximation properties. Demonstrates exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections on dynamics over S^2, SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to geometry-aware learning with theoretical guarantees, enabling both exact geometric constraints when known and learned projections when constraints are unknown, with applications to manifold-valued data and constrained optimization.

Abstract: Preserving geometric structure is important in learning. We propose a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, where both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates arise as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). Within this framework, we establish universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE learns robust, class-aware representations through progressive subspace separation across network depth, with early persistent global attention and measurable feature robustness under degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strong downstream classification performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) and investigate why their representations work so well for image classification tasks.

Method: Layer-wise analysis of token embeddings to study latent space construction, examination of attention patterns across encoder layers, and introduction of two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean/perturbed embeddings and head-wise retention of active features under degradations.

Result: MAE representations are robust to degradations (blur, occlusions); pretrained MAE progressively constructs class-aware latent spaces with increasingly separable class subspaces across depth; exhibits early and persistent global attention unlike standard ViTs; sensitivity indicators successfully quantify feature robustness.

Conclusion: The study reveals that MAE's strong classification performance stems from its ability to learn robust, class-aware representations through progressive subspace separation and consistent global attention patterns, with measurable feature robustness under various degradations.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve first-order spectral descent methods (like Muon) by incorporating curvature-adaptive properties while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to first-order methods.

Method: Uses innovation-augmented polar decomposition to construct an efficient, low-rank quasi-second-order preconditioner that enables anisotropic spectral shaping - adaptively suppressing updates in high-variance subspaces while preserving updates in signal-dominated directions.

Result: Achieves anisotropic spectral shaping with minimal computational overhead and zero additional memory compared to first-order baselines, providing a practical strategy for integrating curvature-adaptive properties into spectral optimization.

Conclusion: PRISM demonstrates a practical approach to enhance spectral descent methods with partial second-order information, enabling curvature adaptation without sacrificing the computational efficiency of first-order methods.

Abstract: We propose PRISM, an optimizer that enhances first-order spectral descent methods like Muon with partial second-order information. It constructs an efficient, low-rank quasi-second-order preconditioner via innovation-augmented polar decomposition. This mechanism enables PRISM to perform anisotropic spectral shaping, which adaptively suppresses updates in high-variance subspaces while preserving update strength in signal-dominated directions. Crucially, this is achieved with minimal computational overhead and zero additional memory compared to first-order baselines. PRISM demonstrates a practical strategy for integrating curvature-adaptive properties into the spectral optimization paradigm.

TL;DR: TextME: First text-only modality expansion framework that projects diverse modalities into LLM embedding space using only text descriptions, enabling zero-shot cross-modal transfer without paired supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal representation expansion is limited by reliance on expensive large-scale paired datasets (text-image, text-audio, etc.), especially in expert domains like medical imaging and molecular analysis where annotation is costly or infeasible.

Method: TextME exploits geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to project diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as unified anchor. Uses only text descriptions without paired supervision, leveraging consistent modality gaps across domains.

Result: Demonstrates consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains. Text-only training preserves substantial performance of pretrained encoders and enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image).

Conclusion: Text-only training establishes a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion, overcoming dataset constraints in specialized domains.

Abstract: Expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities is constrained by reliance on large-scale paired datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, text-3D, text-molecule), which are costly and often infeasible in domains requiring expert annotation such as medical imaging and molecular analysis. We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.

TL;DR: C-GRPO distills MBR decoding into training using group-relative optimization, eliminating inference-time sampling overhead while maintaining performance comparable to MBR decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample-and-rerank methods like MBR decoding are effective but computationally expensive during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Existing amortization approaches require gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and reliance on high-fidelity reward models.

Method: Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) formulates consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO framework. It distills MBR decoding into training using only a utility function and policy samples, without requiring gold references or explicit preference labels.

Result: C-GRPO achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without inference-time overhead, outperforming reference-free baseline methods on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) tasks.

Conclusion: C-GRPO successfully amortizes the computational cost of MBR decoding into training, eliminating the need for expensive inference-time sampling while maintaining strong performance, with theoretical convergence guarantees under ideal conditions.

Abstract: Many strong decoding methods for text generation follow a sample-and-rerank paradigm: they draw multiple candidates, score each under a utility (reward) function using consensus across samples, and return the best one. Although effective, these methods incur high computational costs during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Prior attempts to amortize inference-time computation typically rely on gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and the demand for high-fidelity reward models. We propose Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), which distills Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by formulating the consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO. C-GRPO requires only a utility function and policy samples, without gold references or explicit preference labels. Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee. Experiments on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) demonstrate that C-GRPO successfully achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without the associated inference-time overhead, while outperforming reference-free baseline methods.

TL;DR: QES enables direct fine-tuning of quantized LLMs without backpropagation by integrating error feedback and stateless seed replay, outperforming existing zeroth-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ makes LLMs static and hard to fine-tune since standard methods rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights, which don't work with discrete, non-differentiable quantized parameters.

Method: Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES) performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in quantized space using accumulated error feedback to preserve gradient signals and stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels.

Result: QES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning methods on arithmetic reasoning tasks, enabling direct fine-tuning for quantized models.

Conclusion: QES opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space, making direct fine-tuning of quantized models possible without backpropagation.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at https://github.com/dibbla/Quantized-Evolution-Strategies .

TL;DR: CCTS improves LLM-assisted algorithm discovery by extracting hierarchical concept representations from generated programs and using contrastive learning to guide search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted algorithm discovery treats the process as black-box optimization, but doesn't fully exploit the LLM's internal representation of possible programs. There's a need to better leverage this representation to improve search efficiency and performance.

Method: Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS) extracts hierarchical concept representations from generated programs, learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection by reweighting parents using likelihood-ratio scores between high- and low-performing solutions.

Result: CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Gains are largely driven by learning which concepts to avoid.

Conclusion: CCTS provides effective guidance through explicit concept hierarchies rather than algorithm lineage, with validation in both real LLM settings and controlled synthetic environments showing consistent search dynamics.

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

Motivation: The rapid growth of online shopping has increased demand for timely parcel delivery, requiring logistics providers to enhance hub network efficiency, agility, and predictability.

Method: A novel deep learning-based ensemble framework that leverages historical arrival patterns and real-time parcel status updates to forecast upcoming workloads at logistics hubs.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of online shopping has increased the demand for timely parcel delivery, compelling logistics service providers to enhance the efficiency, agility, and predictability of their hub networks. In order to solve the problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based ensemble framework that leverages historical arrival patterns and real-time parcel status updates to forecast upcoming workloads at logistic hubs. This approach not only facilitates the generation of short-term forecasts, but also improves the accuracy of future hub workload predictions for more strategic planning and resource management. Empirical tests of the algorithm, conducted through a case study of a major city's parcel logistics, demonstrate the ensemble method's superiority over both traditional forecasting techniques and standalone deep learning models. Our findings highlight the significant potential of this method to improve operational efficiency in logistics hubs and advocate for its broader adoption.

*Sampad Mohanty,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SATORIS-N is a traffic-density imputation framework using subspace priors from neighboring days, with explicit SDP formulation for robust reconstruction under high occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic-density matrices from different days show low rank and stable correlations in singular-vector subspaces. In V2X systems, accurate reconstruction is essential for applications like cooperative perception and predictive routing when infrastructure sensors or vehicle observations are incomplete due to communication dropouts or occlusions.

Method: Introduces SATORIS-N with subspace-aware semidefinite programming formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. Also studies lightweight implicit subspace-alignment strategy via concatenation of consecutive day matrices.

Result: Outperforms standard matrix-completion methods (SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and deep learning baselines) at high occlusion levels across Beijing and Shanghai datasets. Explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing.

Conclusion: SATORIS-N provides accurate traffic-density reconstruction essential for V2X applications. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings where singular subspaces evolve slowly over time.

Abstract: Traffic-density matrices from different days exhibit both low rank and stable correlations in their singular-vector subspaces. Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density
  reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization. When infrastructure sensors or vehicle-reported observations are incomplete - due to communication dropouts, sensor occlusions, or sparse connected vehicle penetration-reliable imputation becomes essential for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.

*Baohao Liao,Hanze Dong,Xinxing Xu,Christof Monz,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE improves GRPO for LLM alignment by injecting privileged hints during training to increase rollout diversity under sparse terminal rewards, preventing advantage collapse while maintaining the same verifier reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO stalls under sparse terminal rewards because rollouts within a group often receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish.

Method: SAGE injects privileged hints during training where the model samples a compact hint (e.g., plan or decomposition) and generates solutions conditioned on both prompt and hint, increasing within-group outcome diversity without changing the task reward.

Result: SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO across 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs: +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision effectively addresses GRPO's limitations under sparse rewards by increasing rollout diversity, serving as an adaptive curriculum, and can be deployed without hints at test time.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

*Fanxiao Wani Qiu,Oscar Leong,Alexander LaTourrette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Humans select teaching exemplars using joint representativeness and diversity, best modeled by transformer-based neural network features and dataset distillation principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational principles behind how humans trade off representativeness and diversity when selecting exemplars for teaching, since prior work shows humans consider both but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Method: Modeled human exemplar selection using neural network feature representations (pretrained vision models) and principled subset selection criteria. Created novel visual categories along a 1D morph continuum, varied selection strategies (prototypicality, joint representativeness, diversity), and had adult participants select 1-3 exemplars to teach a learner.

Result: Strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments. Purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks.

Conclusion: Dataset distillation methods in machine learning show potential as computational models for teaching, with transformer-based features better capturing human exemplar selection strategies that balance joint representativeness and diversity.

Abstract: Teaching requires distilling a rich category distribution into a small set of informative exemplars. Although prior work shows that humans consider both representativeness and diversity when teaching, the computational principles underlying these tradeoffs remain unclear. We address this gap by modeling human exemplar selection using neural network feature representations and principled subset selection criteria. Novel visual categories were embedded along a one-dimensional morph continuum using pretrained vision models, and selection strategies varied in their emphasis on prototypicality, joint representativeness, and diversity. Adult participants selected one to three exemplars to teach a learner. Model-human comparisons revealed that strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments, whereas purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Moreover, transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks. These results highlight the potential utility of dataset distillation methods in machine learning as computational models for teaching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemCast is a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates time series forecasting as an experience-conditioned reasoning task, using hierarchical memory to accumulate and leverage historical patterns, reasoning wisdom, and general laws for improved forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting methods lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution capabilities, limiting their ability to learn from past predictions and improve over time.

Method: Proposes MemCast with hierarchical memory organization: summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing temporal features into general laws. Uses dynamic confidence adaptation for continual evolution without test set leakage.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of the learning-to-memory approach.

Conclusion: MemCast successfully addresses the limitations of existing LLM-based forecasters by introducing explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution through hierarchical memory organization and dynamic confidence adaptation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM accelerates RL by using regret-based feedback instead of sparse rewards, achieving 36% faster convergence than PPO in Lunar Lander.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL algorithms suffer from slow convergence due to sparse reward signals, especially in complex environments with delayed feedback. This limits practical applications in robotics, finance, and education where rapid adaptation is needed.

Method: Introduces Psychological Regret Model (PRM) that computes regret signals after each decision step based on the difference between optimal action value and taken action value. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback through step-wise scoring.

Result: PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36% faster than traditional PPO in benchmark environments like Lunar Lander. It's particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback.

Conclusion: PRM bridges behavioral economics and RL by formalizing human-inspired counterfactual thinking as computable regret signals, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring rapid policy adaptation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from slow convergence due to sparse reward signals, particularly in complex environments where feedback is delayed or infrequent. This paper introduces the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), a novel approach that accelerates learning by incorporating regret-based feedback signals after each decision step. Rather than waiting for terminal rewards, PRM computes a regret signal based on the difference between the expected value of the optimal action and the value of the action taken in each state. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback signals through a step-wise scoring framework, enabling faster convergence. We demonstrate that PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36\% faster than traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in benchmark environments such as Lunar Lander. Our results indicate that PRM is particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, finance, and adaptive education where rapid policy adaptation is critical. The approach formalizes human-inspired counterfactual thinking as a computable regret signal, bridging behavioral economics and reinforcement learning.

*Prakhar Godara,Frederick Callaway,Marcelo G. Mattar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial construction approach identifies novel-behavior-eliciting tasks in high-dimensional HMM task spaces, outperforming random sampling for experimental design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in simple domains; need for unified model across task spaces; experimental exploration of entire task space is infeasible due to large size.

Method: Adversarial construction approach to identify tasks most likely to elicit qualitatively novel behavior in binary sequence prediction tasks generated by hidden Markov models (HMM).

Result: Adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments in identifying novel-behavior-eliciting tasks.

Conclusion: Adversarial construction can serve as proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces where exhaustive exploration is infeasible.

Abstract: Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces.

### [411] [Probe-then-Commit Multi-Objective Bandits: Theoretical Benefits of Limited Multi-Arm Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03175)
*Ming Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-objective online learning algorithm for resource selection with limited probe-then-commit feedback, achieving improved regret bounds through frontier-aware probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading require selecting resources with multiple performance metrics (throughput, latency, energy, reliability), but existing multi-objective learning theory focuses on extremes: classical bandits (q=1) or full-information experts (q=K). The probe-then-commit regime (1 < q < K) is practically important but understudied.

Method: Developed PtC-P-UCB algorithm with frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in Pareto mode. It selects q probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. Extended to multi-modal probing where each probe returns M modalities (CSI, queue, compute telemetry).

Result: Proved dominated-hypervolume frontier error of Õ(K_P d/√(qT)) where K_P is Pareto-frontier size, and scalarized regret Õ(L_φ d√((K/q)T)). These show transparent 1/√q acceleration from limited probing. Multi-modal probing yields variance-adaptive bounds via effective noise scale.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between bandits and experts in multi-objective learning, providing practical algorithms with theoretical guarantees for resource selection problems with limited probing capabilities, achieving accelerated learning rates through intelligent frontier-aware exploration.

Abstract: We study an online resource-selection problem motivated by multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading. In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\tilde{O} (K_P d/\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\tilde{O} (L_φd\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $φ$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale.

### [412] [DynSplit-KV: Dynamic Semantic Splitting for KVCache Compression in Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03184)
*Jiancai Ye,Jun Liu,Qingchen Li,Tianlang Zhao,Hanbin Zhang,Jiayi Pan,Ningyi Xu,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynSplit-KV is a KV Cache compression method that uses dynamic semantic splitting with importance-aware delimiter selection and uniform mapping to achieve better accuracy and efficiency in long-context LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV Cache compression methods use rigid splitting strategies (fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters) which cause significant accuracy degradation (5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios due to misalignment with semantic boundaries. The growing memory footprint of KV Cache in long-context scenarios makes compression crucial.

Method: DynSplit-KV dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting KV Cache using: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy that improves accuracy by selecting semantically appropriate boundaries, and (2) a uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format to reduce inference overhead.

Result: DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy among compression methods, with 2.2x speedup compared to FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios. The dynamic delimiter selection improves accuracy by 49.9%, and uniform mapping reduces inference overhead by 4.9x.

Conclusion: Dynamic semantic splitting with importance-aware delimiter selection and uniform mapping effectively addresses the limitations of rigid splitting strategies, providing superior KV Cache compression with better accuracy and efficiency for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Although Key-Value (KV) Cache is essential for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference, its growing memory footprint in long-context scenarios poses a significant bottleneck, making KVCache compression crucial. Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

*Wenquan Lu,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt augmentation enables stable long-term RL training for math reasoning by using diverse reasoning templates to prevent entropy collapse, achieving SOTA results on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RL methods for math reasoning suffer from entropy collapse during training, forcing short training horizons and limiting exploration. Existing approaches also use fixed reasoning prompts, reducing diversity.

Method: Introduces prompt augmentation - training strategy that instructs models to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates/formats to increase rollout diversity. Enables stable scaling without KL regularization.

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model with prompt augmentation achieves SOTA: 44.5% per-benchmark and 51.3% per-question accuracy on math benchmarks (AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, OlympiadBench).

Conclusion: Prompt augmentation solves entropy collapse in RL training, enables long-term stable training without KL regularization, and significantly improves math reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLPT decouples strategic decision-making from token generation by focusing RL optimization only on promising tokens identified via semantic priors, improving training stability and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL for LLMs treats the full vocabulary as action space, which includes many irrelevant tokens that distract from meaningful decision-making among reasonable tokens.

Method: RLPT leverages base model's semantic priors to identify dynamic promising tokens, then constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking, decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation.

Result: RLPT reduces gradient variance, stabilizes training, improves sample efficiency, and outperforms standard RL baselines on math, coding, and telecom reasoning tasks across various model sizes (4B, 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO).

Conclusion: Focusing RL optimization on promising tokens rather than the full vocabulary space addresses the action space distraction problem, leading to more effective and efficient LLM alignment through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).

TL;DR: SLOPE improves MBRL in sparse reward settings by shifting from scalar reward regression to constructing optimistic potential landscapes that provide directional guidance for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MBRL fails in sparse reward environments because regressing ground-truth scalar rewards creates flat, gradient-free landscapes that don't provide directional guidance for planning, severely limiting sample efficiency.

Method: SLOPE shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes using optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, amplifying rare success signals and ensuring exploration gradients.

Result: Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks show SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense reward settings.

Conclusion: SLOPE successfully addresses the core limitation of MBRL in sparse reward environments by transforming reward modeling from scalar prediction to landscape construction, enabling effective planning through informative potential gradients.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) achieves high sample efficiency by simulating future trajectories with learned dynamics and reward models. However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE's Top-k routing is isomorphic to tropical polynomial, partitioning input space via hypersimplex normal fan. This reveals sparsity as combinatorial depth, scaling capacity by binomial coefficient. MoE maintains expressivity on low-dimensional data via combinatorial resilience, unlike dense networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous theoretical justification for MoE architectures beyond heuristic efficiency, connecting their success to geometric expressivity through tropical geometry and combinatorial structures.

Method: Analyze MoE through tropical geometry lens, establish isomorphism between Top-k routing and k-th elementary symmetric tropical polynomial. Use hypersimplex normal fan to partition input space. Introduce Effective Capacity concept under Manifold Hypothesis, prove combinatorial resilience properties.

Result: Top-k routing is algebraically isomorphic to tropical polynomial, revealing sparsity as combinatorial depth scaling capacity by binomial coefficient. MoE exhibits combinatorial resilience maintaining high expressivity on low-dimensional data via routing cone transversality, unlike dense networks which suffer capacity collapse.

Conclusion: The framework unifies discrete geometry of hypersimplex with continuous geometry of neural functions, providing rigorous theoretical justification for topological supremacy of conditional computation in MoE architectures.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures define the state-of-the-art, their theoretical success is often attributed to heuristic efficiency rather than geometric expressivity. In this work, we present the first analysis of MoE through the lens of tropical geometry, establishing that the Top-$k$ routing mechanism is algebraically isomorphic to the $k$-th elementary symmetric tropical polynomial. This isomorphism partitions the input space into the Normal Fan of a Hypersimplex, revealing that \textbf{sparsity is combinatorial depth} which scales geometric capacity by the binomial coefficient $\binom{N}{k}$. Moving beyond ambient bounds, we introduce the concept of \textit{Effective Capacity} under the Manifold Hypothesis. We prove that while dense networks suffer from capacity collapse on low-dimensional data, MoE architectures exhibit \textit{Combinatorial Resilience}, maintaining high expressivity via the transversality of routing cones. In this study, our framework unifies the discrete geometry of the Hypersimplex with the continuous geometry of neural functions, offering a rigorous theoretical justification for the topological supremacy of conditional computation.

TL;DR: LiDAR sampling enables efficient test-time scaling for diffusion models by computing expected future reward using marginal samples without neural backpropagation, achieving 9.5x speedup over gradient guidance methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate samples that don't fully align with human intent, and existing gradient guidance methods are computationally expensive due to sequential neural backpropagation at each time step.

Method: Proposes computing expected future reward (EFR) using only marginal samples from pre-trained diffusion models, detaching neural dependency between intermediate particles and EFR. Introduces lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples efficiently, and uses an accurate solver to guide particles toward high-reward lookahead samples (LiDAR sampling).

Result: LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements with only three samples and 3-step lookahead solver, showing steep performance gains with increased lookahead accuracy and sample count. Reaches same GenEval performance as latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with 9.5x speedup.

Conclusion: LiDAR sampling provides an efficient test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values without expensive neural backpropagation, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance; however, generated samples often fail to fully align with human intent. This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how local interactions give rise to global brain organization, we need models that can represent information across multiple scales. The paper aims to test whether generic graph self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are suitable for connectome-like data.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical SSL framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. Creates a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking connectome topological properties. Uses a four-stage evaluation protocol to test SSL models against classical topology-aware heuristics.

Result: Reveals a critical failure: invariance-based SSL models are fundamentally misaligned with benchmark topological properties and are catastrophically outperformed by classical topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch - SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore community structure that classical methods exploit.

Conclusion: Exposes a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. Presents this as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).

Method: Uses second-order Gaussian process surrogates to model objective and constraints (function values, gradients, Hessians) from zero-order information. At each iteration, constructs local subproblem using GP posterior estimates, solves as second-order cone program accounting for uncertainty, then performs line search via constrained Thompson sampling.

Result: Empirical results show BayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: BayeSQP offers a principled and flexible framework that successfully bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.

Abstract: We introduce BayeSQP, a novel algorithm for general black-box optimization that merges the structure of sequential quadratic programming with concepts from Bayesian optimization. BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.

TL;DR: Streaming Merging with ARM is a novel model updating paradigm that treats merging as iterative optimization, using activation-guided rotation-aware merging to approximate gradient descent dynamics and surpass fully converged SFT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs scale up, efficient adaptation techniques are needed. Existing merging methods are post-hoc refinements or focus on task interference mitigation, failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Method: Proposes Streaming Merging paradigm with ARM (Activation-guided Rotation-aware Merging) strategy. Treats merging coefficients as learning rates, derives rotation vectors from activation subspaces to steer parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Aligns semantic subspaces to preserve geometric structure of parameter evolution.

Result: ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and through iterative merging surpasses fully converged SFT models. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (math, code) demonstrate ARM can transcend converged checkpoints.

Conclusion: ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation, offering a new paradigm that conceptualizes merging as iterative optimization rather than post-hoc refinement.

Abstract: The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraDE: A diffusion-guided search framework using graph diffusion models to efficiently discover frequent subgraph patterns in neural architectures, overcoming limitations of enumeration and sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for finding frequent subgraph patterns (network motifs) in neural architectures face a trade-off: enumeration methods are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large subgraphs, while sampling methods are tractable but suffer from poor discovery capability as subgraph size increases.

Method: Proposes GraDE framework with Graph Diffusion Estimator - the first to use graph diffusion models to identify frequent subgraphs by scoring their typicality within learned distributions, enabling diffusion-guided search that balances computational feasibility and discovery capability.

Result: The estimator achieves superior ranking accuracy with up to 114% improvement over sampling-based baselines. The framework discovers large-scale frequent patterns with up to 30× higher median frequency than sampling methods.

Conclusion: GraDE successfully addresses the trade-off between computational feasibility and discovery capability for finding frequent subgraph patterns in neural architectures, enabling efficient discovery of large-scale patterns that were previously challenging to identify.

Abstract: Finding frequently occurring subgraph patterns or network motifs in neural architectures is crucial for optimizing efficiency, accelerating design, and uncovering structural insights. However, as the subgraph size increases, enumeration-based methods are perfectly accurate but computationally prohibitive, while sampling-based methods are computationally tractable but suffer from a severe decline in discovery capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraDE, a diffusion-guided search framework that ensures both computational feasibility and discovery capability. The key innovation is the Graph Diffusion Estimator (GraDE), which is the first to introduce graph diffusion models to identify frequent subgraphs by scoring their typicality within the learned distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the estimator achieves superior ranking accuracy, with up to 114\% improvement compared to sampling-based baselines. Benefiting from this, the proposed framework successfully discovers large-scale frequent patterns, achieving up to 30$\times$ higher median frequency than sampling-based methods.

*Hicham Eddoubi,Umar Faruk Abdullahi,Fadi Hassan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that adversarial token placement (prefix vs suffix) significantly affects jailbreak attack success rates in LLMs, exposing a blind spot in current safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need robust safety alignment, but jailbreak attacks like GCG bypass these protections. Current research overlooks how adversarial token placement within prompts affects attack success rates.

Method: Using GCG as a case study, researchers optimized attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varied adversarial token positions during evaluation to measure impact on success rates.

Result: Both optimizing attacks for prefixes and varying adversarial token positions substantially influence attack success rates, revealing a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations.

Conclusion: The position of adversarial tokens is a crucial factor in LLM adversarial robustness evaluation that must be accounted for in safety assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across multiple domains, creating an urgent need for robust safety alignment mechanisms. However, robustness remains challenging due to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment via adversarial prompts. In this work, we focus on the prevalent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack and identify a previously underexplored attack axis in jailbreak attacks typically framed as suffix-based: the placement of adversarial tokens within the prompt. Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework using Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs) to detect hidden toxicity in multimodal data, introduces a quantifiable metric (MTC) for toxicity covertness, and creates a benchmark dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity in multimodal data often hides beneath seemingly benign individual modalities, only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. Current methods struggle to detect this covert toxicity.

Method: Uses Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs) to model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Introduces Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC) metric to measure concealment. Creates Covert Toxic Dataset as benchmark.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes. Provides interpretable and auditable detection outcomes with enhanced transparency.

Conclusion: Advances state-of-the-art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lays foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

Abstract: Detecting toxicity in multimodal data remains a significant challenge, as harmful meanings often lurk beneath seemingly benign individual modalities: only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

*Haixia Liu,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlockRR is a unified randomized-response framework for label differential privacy that generalizes existing mechanisms and maintains privacy while improving accuracy in high-to-moderate privacy regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized-response mechanisms for label differential privacy require separate case-by-case analysis. The authors aim to create a unified framework that generalizes these approaches and eliminates the need for individual mechanism analysis.

Method: BlockRR is a novel randomized-response mechanism for label DP that generalizes existing RR-type mechanisms. The authors design a partition method based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information, leveraging the parallel composition principle to ensure composed mechanisms remain ε-label DP.

Result: Theoretical proof shows BlockRR satisfies ε-label DP. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 variants with class imbalance shows BlockRR achieves better balance between test accuracy and per-class accuracy in high-privacy (ε≤3.0) and moderate-privacy regimes, while reducing to standard RR without performance loss in low-privacy regimes (ε≥4.0).

Conclusion: BlockRR provides a unified framework for label differential privacy that outperforms existing methods in high-to-moderate privacy settings while maintaining theoretical privacy guarantees and practical performance advantages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BlockRR, a novel and unified randomized-response mechanism for label differential privacy. This framework generalizes existed RR-type mechanisms as special cases under specific parameter settings, which eliminates the need for separate, case-by-case analysis. Theoretically, we prove that BlockRR satisfies $ε$-label DP. We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $ε$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($ε\leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy. In the low-privacy regime ($ε\geq 4.0$), all methods reduce BlockRR to standard RR without additional performance loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical justification for the common "measure, apply scalar nonlinearities, then combine" design pattern used in operator learning and imaging applications, by establishing universal approximation results on compact subsets.

Method: The authors prove universal approximation theorems for continuous functionals on compact subsets of products of Hilbert spaces. They show these functionals can be uniformly approximated by models that first take finitely many continuous linear measurements of inputs, then combine these measurements through continuous scalar nonlinearities.

*Pritam Kar,Rahul Bordoloi,Olaf Wolkenhauer,Saptarshi Bej*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSDE is an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that identifies anomalies by measuring their geometric displacement under iterative density enhancement, achieving robust performance across various anomaly types and noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods lack robustness across different anomaly types and perform poorly under noisy settings, requiring a more generalizable approach that doesn't rely on specific structural assumptions.

Method: MSDE uses a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive density weights from UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graphs. It measures anomaly scores as total displacement accumulated over mean-shift iterations, where normal samples remain stable while anomalies are attracted toward density modes.

Result: On ADBench benchmark (46 datasets, 4 anomaly types, 6 noise levels), MSDE outperforms 13 baselines with consistently strong, balanced performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n across noise levels and anomaly types.

Conclusion: Displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection, offering generalizable performance without relying on specific structural assumptions about anomalies.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Lipschitz multiscale DEQ improves fixed-point convergence in deep equilibrium models, achieving 4.75× speed-up on CIFAR-10 with minor accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEQs achieve memory-efficient infinite-depth networks but suffer from slow training/inference due to unreliable fixed-point convergence. Need to guarantee convergence to reduce computational time.

Method: Restructure DEQ architecture with Lipschitz multiscale design that theoretically guarantees fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes via hyperparameter adjustment.

Result: Achieves up to 4.75× speed-up on CIFAR-10 image classification with only minor accuracy drop compared to conventional DEQs.

Conclusion: Lipschitz multiscale DEQ successfully addresses DEQ's computational bottleneck by guaranteeing fixed-point convergence, enabling practical speed improvements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) achieve infinitely deep network representations without stacking layers by exploring fixed points of layer transformations in neural networks. Such models constitute an innovative approach that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in many large-scale numerical experiments, despite requiring significantly less memory. However, DEQs face the challenge of requiring vastly more computational time for training and inference than conventional methods, as they repeatedly perform fixed-point iterations with no convergence guarantee upon each input. Therefore, this study explored an approach to improve fixed-point convergence and consequently reduce computational time by restructuring the model architecture to guarantee fixed-point convergence. Our proposed approach for image classification, Lipschitz multiscale DEQ, has theoretically guaranteed fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes by hyperparameter adjustment, achieving up to a 4.75$\times$ speed-up in numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a minor drop in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Q-learning lacks convergence guarantees under linear function approximation, requiring regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence.

Method: Introduces regularization at projection operator level, constructs Regularized Projected Value Iteration (RP-VI), extends to sample-based PRQ algorithm.

Result: Establishes PRQ algorithm with rigorous theoretical analysis proving finite-time convergence guarantees under linear function approximation.

Conclusion: PRQ provides a theoretically sound solution to the convergence problem of Q-learning under linear function approximation through projection regularization.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), Q-learning is a fundamental algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed in the tabular setting. However, this convergence guarantee does not hold under linear function approximation. To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction. By extending this regularized projection into the stochastic setting, we establish the PRQ algorithm and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that proves finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation.

TL;DR: EGSPO is a three-stage hybrid training framework that combines SFT and RL with token-level gradient modulation using entropy gating to improve mathematical reasoning performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hybrid training methods for LLMs combine SFT and RL at the sample level, but this approach doesn't optimize learning at the token level. The authors aim to improve training efficiency by modulating gradients based on token-level uncertainty.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) SFT expert learning for warm-up policy, 2) RL rollout generation with per-token entropy computation, 3) EGSPO mechanism with entropy-gated gradient allocation - high entropy tokens get full PPO updates for exploration, low entropy tokens get attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge.

Result: EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks: 3.8% gain on AIME and 2.9% gain on MATH over CHORD phi baseline, with only 3.4% additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: EGSPO demonstrates that token-level gradient modulation through entropy gating can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in LLMs while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a promising direction for hybrid training methods.

Abstract: Hybrid training methods for large language models combine supervised fine tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations with reinforcement learning (RL) on model rollouts, typically at the sample level. We propose Entropy Gated Selective Policy Optimization (EGSPO), a three stage framework that extends sample level mixing with token level gradient modulation.
  Stage 1, SFT expert learning, establishes a reliable warm up policy using expert demonstrations with a pure SFT loss. Stage 2, RL rollout generation, samples trajectories from the current policy and computes per token predictive entropy. Stage 3, the EGSPO mechanism, applies entropy gated gradient allocation: a predictive entropy module routes high entropy tokens to full PPO updates to encourage exploration, and low entropy tokens to attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge. Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors.
  EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with gains of 3.8 percent on AIME and 2.9 percent on MATH over the CHORD phi baseline, while incurring only 3.4 percent additional computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper shows Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can be framed as optimization with inexact gradient oracles, enabling direct proofs for existing methods and development of accelerated schemes with reduced communication complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to Byzantine failures (adversarial nodes). While robust aggregations exist, analyses remain ad-hoc, hindering development of more complex accelerated algorithms.

Method: 1) Frame Byzantine-robust distributed optimization as general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (additive + multiplicative error). 2) Propose two optimization schemes: Nesterov-type accelerated scheme using accelerated inexact gradient results, and Optimization under Similarity using auxiliary loss function approximation.

Result: The framework allows direct proof that GD with robust aggregation achieves optimal asymptotic error. Both proposed approaches drastically reduce communication complexity compared to previous methods, shown theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can be systematically analyzed through inexact gradient oracles framework, enabling development of accelerated schemes with significantly improved communication efficiency.

Abstract: Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial nodes, a.k.a. Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.
  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.

Motivation: To create prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees that are robust to model misspecification while maintaining smaller and more stable set sizes compared to existing methods.

Method: Uses Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores within a split conformal framework, with Bayesian quadrature to estimate and minimize expected prediction set size.

Result: BCP achieves valid empirical coverage (81% vs nominal 80%) even under model misspecification, while Bayesian credible intervals severely under-cover (49%). It yields prediction sets of comparable size to split conformal but with substantially lower run-to-run variability.

Conclusion: BCP provides a robust Bayesian conformal prediction method that maintains coverage guarantees under misspecification while offering more stable and efficient prediction sets than existing approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores and Bayesian quadrature are used to estimate and minimise the expected prediction set size. Operating within a split conformal framework, BCP provides valid coverage guarantees and demonstrates reliable empirical coverage under model misspecification. Across regression and classification tasks, including distribution-shifted settings such as ImageNet-A, BCP yields prediction sets of comparable size to split conformal prediction, while exhibiting substantially lower run-to-run variability in set size. In sparse regression with nominal coverage of 80 percent, BCP achieves 81 percent empirical coverage under a misspecified prior, whereas Bayesian credible intervals under-cover at 49 percent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Models achieve robustness automatically as they approach high performance on tasks, with robustness emerging as a byproduct of task competence rather than requiring separate optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional view that robustness is an independent capability requiring explicit measurement and improvement, and to show that robustness naturally emerges as models master tasks.

Method: Empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (paraphrases, different temperatures) to examine the relationship between task performance and robustness.

Result: Strong positive correlation found between task performance and robustness, with robustness primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties.

Conclusion: Robustness emerges naturally as tasks saturate, suggesting reduced need for explicit robustness efforts; easier tasks are reliable for real-world deployment while literature tasks remain unreliable.

Abstract: Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting scalability to large datasets. There's a need for efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale observational data while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Method: Leverages invariance principle: distribution of effect conditioned on causes remains invariant to changes in prior distribution of causes. Tests potential causal relationships by checking variance of effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets with different cause prior distributions. Uses sparsity assumption to develop efficient algorithm with quadratic complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 25x speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior or equivalent performance on large-scale benchmark datasets. Enhanced scalability with quadratic complexity in number of variables.

Conclusion: The invariance-based framework provides an efficient and scalable approach to causal discovery from observational data, offering significant computational advantages without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for recovering causal graphs from observational data, leveraging the observation that the distribution of an effect, conditioned on its causes, remains invariant to changes in the prior distribution of those causes. This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical experiments on a varied benchmark of large-scale datasets show superior or equivalent performance compared to existing works, while achieving enhanced scalability.

### [435] [Achieving Linear Speedup for Composite Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03357)
*Kun Huang,Shi Pu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNMap achieves linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning using normal map-based updates and local correction for data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Composite federated learning with nonsmooth regularizers faces challenges from data heterogeneity across clients, requiring methods that can handle both smooth losses and nonsmooth terms while achieving efficient convergence.

Method: FedNMap uses a normal map-based update scheme to handle nonsmooth regularizers and incorporates local correction strategies to mitigate data heterogeneity effects across clients.

Result: FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both number of clients and local updates for nonconvex losses, with and without Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition - the first such result for nonconvex composite federated learning.

Conclusion: FedNMap provides an effective solution for composite federated learning with nonsmooth regularizers, achieving theoretical linear speedup guarantees while handling data heterogeneity through local correction strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedNMap, a normal map-based method for composite federated learning, where the objective consists of a smooth loss and a possibly nonsmooth regularizer. FedNMap leverages a normal map-based update scheme to handle the nonsmooth term and incorporates a local correction strategy to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across clients. Under standard assumptions, including smooth local losses, weak convexity of the regularizer, and bounded stochastic gradient variance, FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both the number of clients $n$ and the number of local updates $Q$ for nonconvex losses, both with and without the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeKi enables edge device LLM deployment by scaling model capacity through storage space instead of FLOPs, using token-level memory experts and re-parameterization to achieve zero inference latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM scaling via increased parameters or computations is impractical for edge devices with limited RAM and NPU resources, yet deploying performant LLMs on smartphones remains crucial for user experience.

Method: Proposes MeKi system with token-level memory experts in each Transformer layer that inject pre-stored semantic knowledge. Uses re-parameterization to fold training parameter matrices into compact static lookup tables, offloading knowledge to ROM.

Result: MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, demonstrating effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs with zero inference latency overhead.

Conclusion: MeKi successfully decouples model capacity from computational cost, enabling performant LLM deployment on edge devices through storage-based scaling rather than computational scaling.

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.

*Sangyeon Yoon,Hyesoo Hong,Wonje Jeung,Albert No*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Syntactic similarity, not topical relevance, drives benign relearning in machine unlearning; syntactic diversification via query paraphrasing suppresses relearning and improves unlearning efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods are fragile due to benign relearning - forgotten information reemerges from benign fine-tuning data. The common explanation of topical relevance is insufficient, so the paper investigates the true driver of this phenomenon.

Method: Systematic analysis reveals syntactic similarity as the primary driver of benign relearning. The paper introduces syntactic diversification, which paraphrases original forget queries into heterogeneous structures before unlearning to disrupt syntactic alignment.

Result: Syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap. Syntactic diversification effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.

Conclusion: Syntactic similarity, not topicality, is the key driver of benign relearning in machine unlearning. Syntactic diversification provides an effective solution that improves unlearning robustness while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific content from trained models while preserving overall performance. However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.

*Bart Cox,Antreas Ioannou,Jérémie Decouchant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Morph is a topology optimization algorithm for decentralized learning that dynamically reshapes communication graphs based on model dissimilarity to handle non-IID data distributions and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning struggles with non-IID data distributions and static communication topologies, which limit model accuracy and convergence. There's a need for adaptive topology optimization to address data heterogeneity in distributed settings.

Method: Morph uses gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection where nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. It maintains fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through local decisions without global knowledge.

Result: On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves 1.12x relative improvement in test accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, it achieves 1.08x higher accuracy than Epidemic Learning. For 50 nodes, Morph narrows the gap to fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Morph demonstrates higher final accuracy, faster convergence, more stable learning (lower inter-node variance), and requires fewer communication rounds than baselines while operating without global knowledge, making it effective for decentralized learning with non-IID data.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables a set of nodes to train a model collaboratively without central coordination, offering benefits for privacy and scalability. However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge.

*Leif Doering,Daniel Schmidt,Moritz Melcher,Sebastian Kassing,Benedikt Wille,Tilman Aach,Simon Weissmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPO's theoretical convergence is proven under standard assumptions, showing its policy update approximates policy gradient ascent. A weight correction for truncated GAE addresses infinite mass collapse at episode boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO is widely used but lacks complete theoretical foundations, particularly regarding convergence guarantees and understanding its fundamental advantages. The paper aims to provide theoretical analysis of PPO's convergence and identify issues in its implementation.

Method: The authors interpret PPO's policy update scheme as approximated policy gradient ascent, control bias from surrogate gradients, and use random reshuffling techniques to prove convergence. They also identify and correct an issue in truncated GAE where geometric weighting causes infinite mass collapse at episode boundaries.

Result: The paper proves a convergence theorem for PPO that explains its success. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction for truncated GAE yields substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signals like Lunar Lander.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical foundations for PPO's convergence, explains its practical success, and offers a practical improvement to address issues in truncated GAE implementation, particularly beneficial for environments with terminal signals.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yet its theoretical foundations remain incomplete. Most importantly, convergence and understanding of fundamental PPO advantages remain widely open. Under standard theory assumptions we show how PPO's policy update scheme (performing multiple epochs of minibatch updates on multi-use rollouts with a surrogate gradient) can be interpreted as approximated policy gradient ascent. We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander.

### [440] [Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy for Long-Horizon Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03389)
*Jinwoo Choi,Sang-Hyun Lee,Seung-Woo Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoGHP is a hierarchical RL framework that uses autoregressive sequence modeling to generate multiple latent subgoals for long-horizon tasks, outperforming existing offline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical RL methods for offline goal-conditioned tasks are inadequate for complex long-horizon tasks because they typically use separate networks and generate only single intermediate subgoals, failing to coordinate multiple intermediate decisions needed for complex tasks.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP) that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given state and final goal, it autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step. Uses MLP-Mixer backbone for efficient cross-token communication and capturing structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action.

Result: CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The chain-of-goals approach with unified autoregressive modeling and MLP-Mixer backbone effectively addresses limitations of existing hierarchical methods for complex long-horizon offline goal-conditioned RL tasks.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning remains challenging for long-horizon tasks. While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks.

*Shumin Wang,Yuexiang Xie,Wenhao Zhang,Yuchang Sun,Yanxi Chen,Yaliang Li,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical framework for analyzing entropy dynamics in reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs, with practical entropy control methods derived from the analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While entropy is crucial for measuring LLM output diversity and balancing exploration-exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning, there's a lack of principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process.

Method: Established theoretical framework starting with discriminant expression for entropy change under single logit update, derived first-order expression for entropy change, extended to GRPO update formula, and designed entropy control methods based on theoretical insights.

Result: Derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods, provided empirical evidence supporting theoretical conclusions, and demonstrated effectiveness of entropy control methods.

Conclusion: Study provides novel insights into RFT training dynamics, offering theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

*Chen-Hui Song,Shuoling Liu,Liyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that optimal supervision signals for financial forecasting often differ from actual prediction targets, introducing the Label Horizon Paradox and proposing a bi-level optimization framework to find optimal proxy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the conventional assumption that training labels must strictly match inference targets in financial forecasting, noting that while deep learning architectures have advanced, the design of supervision signals remains under-scrutinized.

Method: The authors propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies optimal proxy labels within a single training run, grounded in theoretical analysis of dynamic signal-noise trade-off where generalization depends on competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The work uncovers the Label Horizon Paradox in financial forecasting and opens new avenues for label-centric research by showing that optimal supervision signals often deviate from prediction goals across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics.

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.

### [443] [Most Convolutional Networks Suffer from Small Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03415)
*Amit Daniely,Idan Mehalel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that adversarial examples exist very close to inputs in random CNNs, specifically at distance ∥x∥/√d, which is essentially optimal, and can be found with single-step gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial examples are well-understood for fully connected networks, they remain less understood for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recent work by Daniely (2025) showed adversarial examples exist in CNNs but at non-optimal distances. This paper aims to establish the existence of adversarial examples at essentially optimal distances in random CNNs.

Method: The authors use Fourier decomposition to bound the singular values of random linear convolutional operators, which are key components of CNN layers. This bound enables proving that adversarial examples exist at optimal distances. They also show these adversarial perturbations can be found using a single gradient descent step.

Result: The main result proves that adversarial examples in random CNNs with input dimension d can be found at ℓ₂-distance of order ∥x∥/√d from input x, which is essentially the nearest possible distance. Additionally, such small adversarial perturbations can be found using just one step of gradient descent.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that adversarial examples exist at essentially optimal distances in random CNNs, improving upon previous work. The Fourier-based bound on random convolutional operators is a key technical contribution that may have independent interest beyond adversarial example analysis.

Abstract: The existence of adversarial examples is relatively understood for random fully connected neural networks, but much less so for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The recent work [Daniely, 2025] establishes that adversarial examples can be found in CNNs, in some non-optimal distance from the input. We extend over this work and prove that adversarial examples in random CNNs with input dimension $d$ can be found already in $\ell_2$-distance of order $\lVert x \rVert /\sqrt{d}$ from the input $x$, which is essentially the nearest possible. We also show that such adversarial small perturbations can be found using a single step of gradient descent. To derive our results we use Fourier decomposition to efficiently bound the singular values of a random linear convolutional operator, which is the main ingredient of a CNN layer. This bound might be of independent interest.

*Xin Sheng,Jiaxin Li,Yujuan Pang,Ran Peng,Yong Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR with positive-negative pairing improves prompt selection by pairing hard-but-solvable prompts with easy-but-brittle ones, providing bidirectional learning signals for better sample efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RLVR prompt selection based only on training-accuracy variance leads to unstable optimization and weak transfer. Need better mechanism-level prompt selection that provides both reliable positive anchors and explicit negative learning signals.

Method: Propose positive-negative pairing: sample hard-but-solvable prompt (low success rate) and easy-but-brittle prompt (high but not perfect success rate) per update. Introduce Weighted GRPO with pair-level outcome reweighting and group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes into positive guidance and rare failures into negative penalties.

Result: On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, single paired minibatch outperforms GRPO baseline with variance-based selection: AIME 2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0. Competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from 1209 prompts. Similar gains on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Positive-negative pairing with Weighted GRPO provides bidirectional learning signals that improve sample efficiency without suppressing exploration, leading to better performance on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks with few prompts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts. Similar gains are observed on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.

*Maresa Schröder,Miruna Oprescu,Stefan Feuerriegel,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A partial identification framework for causal inference on networks that provides sharp bounds on treatment effects when exposure mappings are misspecified, with applications to three common exposure settings and efficient estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing network causal inference methods rely on exposure mappings to simplify complex network dependencies, but these mappings are often misspecified, leading to biased estimates of direct and spillover effects.

Method: Proposes a partial identification framework that derives sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under exposure mapping misspecification. Develops orthogonal estimators for these bounds and proves their validity, sharpness, and efficiency.

Result: The framework provides informative bounds that remain reliable under exposure mapping misspecification. The estimators are shown to be valid, sharp, and efficient through theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed partial identification framework offers a robust approach to causal inference on networks when exposure mappings may be misspecified, providing reliable bounds on treatment effects for three canonical exposure settings.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.

TL;DR: Soft-Radial Projection: a differentiable layer that maps points into feasible set interior to avoid gradient saturation from boundary projections, enabling better optimization for constraint-satisfying deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries suffer from gradient saturation - orthogonal projections collapse exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, creating rank-deficient Jacobians that nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints, hindering optimization in safety-critical systems.

Method: Soft-Radial Projection: a differentiable reparameterization layer using radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set, guaranteeing strict feasibility while preserving full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere.

Result: Theoretically proven to retain universal approximation property; empirically shows improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

Conclusion: Soft-Radial Projection effectively circumvents gradient saturation issues of boundary-based methods while maintaining feasibility, enabling better optimization for constraint-satisfying deep learning in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell RNA-seq data is high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, making autoregressive generation problematic due to artificial ordering bias and error accumulation. There's a need for a biologically coherent generation approach that aligns with the dropout-like corruption process inherent in scRNA-seq data.

Method: Proposes scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model with continuous-time forward masking in token space. Uses a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, with entropy-normalized serialization and latent anchor token for information efficiency. Trained via depth-invariant time sampling and dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels.

Result: Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction.

Conclusion: Masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregressive methods for single-cell RNA-seq data generation.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq profiles are high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, causing autoregressive generation to impose an artificial ordering bias and suffer from error accumulation. To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a hard challenge in integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training for sequential/temporal domains with subsymbolic observations. Current approaches struggle to bridge symbolic reasoning with subsymbolic learning in temporally extended tasks.

Method: DeepDFA is a neurosymbolic framework that models temporal rules (expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata or Moore Machines) as continuous, differentiable layers. This allows symbolic knowledge injection into neural architectures for handling subsymbolic observations in sequential domains.

Result: DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and other neuro-symbolic systems across extensive experiments. It achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration for both static image sequence classification and policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments.

Conclusion: DeepDFA successfully bridges subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks, demonstrating strong potential for neurosymbolic integration in temporally extended domains.

Abstract: Integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training is still a hard challenge, especially for sequential or temporally extended domains involving subsymbolic observations. To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks.

TL;DR: Recurrent neural networks trained on sequential token prediction from 2D scenes develop structured world models through in-context learning, showing path integration and dynamic binding of identity to position.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether action-conditioned sequential prediction alone can lead to the formation of structured internal world models in neural networks, addressing how predictive networks might develop cognitive representations of objects and their relations.

Method: Train a recurrent neural network on sequential token prediction from 2D continuous token scenes, where the network receives current input and saccade-like displacements to predict upcoming tokens, then analyze performance on novel scenes.

Result: Prediction accuracy improves across sequences on novel scenes (in-context learning), with decoding analyses revealing path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show new bindings can be learned late in sequence and out-of-distribution bindings can be acquired.

Conclusion: Structured representations relying on flexible binding emerge from sequential prediction, providing a mechanistic account of how neural networks can develop world models relevant to cognitive science through action-conditioned prediction.

Abstract: Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.

Motivation: LoRA methods face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, with existing methods providing inconsistent recommendations.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of performance-forgetting trade-offs in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. The approach focuses on fine-tuning intermediate components rather than first (PiSSA) or last (MiLoRA) components.

Result: Fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and shows more robustness to high learning rates. The proposed initialization approach offers superior trade-offs, improving accuracy and reducing forgetting across various computer vision and NLP tasks, including continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical LoRA initialization approach that achieves better performance-forgetting trade-offs by focusing on intermediate principal components, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse tasks and learning scenarios.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have emerged as crucial techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under computational and memory constraints. However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs. We demonstrate in a thorough empirical study on a variety of computer vision and NLP tasks that our approach improves accuracy and reduces forgetting, also in continual learning scenarios.

*Xuejie Liu,Yap Vit Chun,Yitao Liang,Anji Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POKE-SMC improves diffusion LLM inference by optimizing unmasking paths using path log-likelihood estimation and Sequential Monte Carlo search, achieving 2-3% accuracy gains across reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion LLMs rely on heuristic unmasking strategies that greedily optimize local confidence, lacking principled guidance for globally consistent and accurate generation paths.

Method: Introduces path log-likelihood (Path LL) as a trajectory-conditioned objective, develops POKE value estimator for predicting future Path LL, and integrates it into POKE-SMC - a Sequential Monte Carlo search framework for dynamic unmasking path optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show consistent accuracy improvements, achieving 2-3% average gains over strong baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models, advancing the accuracy-compute Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: POKE-SMC provides a principled approach to unmasking path selection in diffusion LLMs, enabling more globally consistent and accurate generation through lookahead-based path optimization.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) support arbitrary-order generation, yet their inference performance critically depends on the unmasking order. Existing strategies rely on heuristics that greedily optimize local confidence, offering limited guidance for identifying unmasking paths that are globally consistent and accurate. To bridge this gap, we introduce path log-likelihood (Path LL), a trajectory-conditioned objective that strongly correlates with downstream accuracy and enables principled selection of unmasking paths. To optimize Path LL at inference time, we propose POKE, an efficient value estimator that predicts the expected future Path LL of a partial decoding trajectory. We then integrate this lookahead signal into POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo-based search framework for dynamically identifying optimal unmasking paths. Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show that POKE-SMC consistently improves accuracy, achieving 2%--3% average gains over strong decoding-time scaling baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models and advancing the accuracy--compute Pareto frontier.

*Hai Zhong,Zhuoran Li,Xun Wang,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RFO is a new model-based RL method that combines flow policies with reparameterization gradients, achieving high sample efficiency without log-likelihood calculations through joint backpropagation and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RPG methods are limited to Gaussian policies, which restricts performance and fails to leverage advances in generative models. Flow policies naturally align with RPG but naive integration suffers from instability and poor exploration.

Method: RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through flow generation (differentiable ODE integration) and system dynamics. It includes two regularization terms for stability and exploration, plus a variant with action chunking.

Result: Extensive experiments on locomotion and manipulation tasks with rigid/soft bodies and state/visual inputs show RFO's effectiveness. On a challenging soft-body quadruped locomotion task, RFO achieves almost 2× the reward of state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RFO successfully integrates flow policies with RPG framework, overcoming training instability and exploration issues through joint backpropagation and regularization, demonstrating superior performance on diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for model-based reinforcement learning, enabling high sample efficiency by backpropagating gradients through differentiable dynamics. However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.

TL;DR: PATCHES algorithm discovers 28 compact circuits in SR transformers, establishing mechanistic interpretability for symbolic regression and showing mean patching outperforms logit attribution for causal circuit discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are effective for symbolic regression but their internal mechanisms for generating mathematical operators remain unexplored. Mechanistic interpretability has worked for language/vision models but not yet applied to SR, creating a gap in understanding how SR transformers work internally.

Method: Introduces PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Uses causal evaluation framework based on faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Compares mean patching with performance-based evaluation against direct logit attribution and probing classifiers.

Result: Isolated 28 circuits, providing first circuit-level characterization of an SR transformer. Mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. Direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational rather than causal features, limiting their utility for circuit discovery.

Conclusion: Establishes SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and proposes a principled methodology for circuit discovery. PATCHES enables understanding of how SR transformers generate mathematical operators internally.

Abstract: Following their success across many domains, transformers have also proven effective for symbolic regression (SR); however, the internal mechanisms underlying their generation of mathematical operators remain largely unexplored. Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.

*Ronald Katende*

TL;DR: The paper investigates when algorithmic stability explains generalization in modern learning systems that interpolate training data. It proposes a contractive propagation condition and stability certificate to measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, but it's unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. The paper aims to identify regimes where stability explains generalization versus where alternative mechanisms are needed.

Method: Models training as a function-space trajectory and measures sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory. Proposes a contractive propagation condition and obtains a stability certificate by unrolling the resulting recursion.

Result: A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, but the paper also proves there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing stability is not a universal explanation. Experiments confirm certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success, providing a tool to distinguish between stability-based and non-stability-based generalization in interpolating learning systems.

*Hyunji Jung,Sungbin Shin,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Basis rotation addresses gradient staleness in asynchronous pipeline parallelism, enabling scalable training by aligning gradients with Hessian eigenbasis, achieving 76.8% faster convergence for 1B-parameter LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism eliminates pipeline bubbles for better hardware utilization but suffers from gradient staleness that scales linearly with pipeline depth, undermining scalability. Current methods fail to address the misalignment between Hessian eigenbasis and coordinate basis, preventing effective optimization.

Method: Proposes basis rotation to rectify delayed gradients by aligning them with the Hessian eigenbasis. This addresses the misalignment issue that prevents coordinate-wise adaptive optimizers like Adam from leveraging curvature information effectively in asynchronous settings.

Result: Basis rotation significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous pipeline parallelism. Training a 1B-parameter LLM achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel baseline.

Conclusion: Basis rotation effectively mitigates gradient staleness in asynchronous pipeline parallelism by addressing the fundamental alignment problem between gradients and Hessian eigenbasis, enabling scalable distributed training while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.

TL;DR: PNS generates high-quality negative samples for LLM reasoning training by creating responses that look correct but give wrong answers, outperforming other methods by 2.03%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative for LLM reasoning training, but they overlook the importance of sample quality - not all negative samples are equally useful for learning.

Method: Proposes Plausible Negative Samples (PNS) that synthesizes high-quality negative samples with correct format/structure but wrong answers. Uses reverse reinforcement learning with composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation.

Result: PNS outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.

Conclusion: PNS provides high-quality negative samples that are nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions, serving as an effective plug-and-play data source for preference optimization in LLM reasoning training.

Abstract: Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.

TL;DR: Rank-Learner: A two-stage method that directly learns rankings of treatment effects from observational data without explicit CATE estimation, using pairwise learning with Neyman-orthogonal guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world applications require ranking individuals by treatment effects rather than estimating exact effect magnitudes (e.g., prioritizing patients for preventive care, ranking customers for targeted ads). While causal effect estimation has been well-studied, directly learning treatment effect rankings has been largely unexplored.

Method: Rank-Learner is a two-stage learner that optimizes a pairwise learning objective to recover true treatment effect ordering without explicit CATE estimation. It is Neyman-orthogonal (robust to nuisance function estimation errors) and model-agnostic (can use arbitrary ML models like neural networks).

Result: Extensive experiments show Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods in learning treatment effect rankings.

Conclusion: Rank-Learner provides practitioners with a novel, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by treatment effects, solving a more direct problem than traditional CATE estimation approaches.

Abstract: Many decision-making problems require ranking individuals by their treatment effects rather than estimating the exact effect magnitudes. Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects.

TL;DR: AC-MIL: A novel Action-aware Capsule Multiple Instance Learning framework for detecting coordinated malicious behaviors in live streaming rooms using only room-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live streaming faces severe risks from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors that are hard to detect timely. These behaviors are often concealed within normal activities, and current approaches struggle with weak supervision where only room-level labels are available.

Method: Formulates risk assessment as a Multiple Instance Learning problem where each room is a bag and structured user-timeslot capsules are instances. Proposes AC-MIL framework that models individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns through serial and parallel architecture encoding temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale Douyin datasets show AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. Provides capsule-level interpretability for identifying risky behavior segments.

Conclusion: AC-MIL effectively addresses the challenge of detecting coordinated malicious behaviors in live streaming with weak supervision, offering both accurate room-level risk prediction and interpretable evidence for intervention.

Abstract: Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logic neural networks have high training costs, introduce redundancy, rely on approximate gradients, and lack scalability, limiting their practical application for fast AI inference.

Method: Introduces WAlsh Relaxation for Probabilistic (WARP) logic neural networks - a gradient-based framework that learns combinations of hardware-native logic blocks. Uses learnable thresholding, residual initialization, and stochastic smoothing to bridge relaxed training and discrete logic inference.

Result: WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions, shows faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, and scales effectively to deeper architectures and higher-arity logic functions.

Conclusion: WARP overcomes limitations of existing logic neural networks by providing an efficient, scalable gradient-based framework that bridges relaxed training with discrete logic inference, enabling practical deployment for fast AI inference.

Abstract: Fast and efficient AI inference is increasingly important, and recent models that directly learn low-level logic operations have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing logic neural networks incur high training costs, introduce redundancy or rely on approximate gradients, which limits scalability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WAlsh Relaxation for Probabilistic (WARP) logic neural networks -- a novel gradient-based framework that efficiently learns combinations of hardware-native logic blocks. We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, while scaling effectively to deeper architectures and logic functions with higher input arity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient sparse training methods that can explore sparse parameter spaces while maintaining both sparsity and model accuracy, reducing computational costs compared to standard training approaches.

Method: Combines sparsity-inducing Bregman iterations with adaptive freezing of network structure, alternating between static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates, embedded in a multilevel optimization framework.

Result: Produces highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks, reducing theoretical FLOPs from 38% (standard Bregman) to 6% of SGD while maintaining test accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic sparse training algorithm effectively balances sparsity exploration and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art compression-performance tradeoffs with strong theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce a dynamic sparse training algorithm based on linearized Bregman iterations / mirror descent that exploits the naturally incurred sparsity by alternating between periods of static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates. The key idea is to combine sparsity-inducing Bregman iterations with adaptive freezing of the network structure to enable efficient exploration of the sparse parameter space while maintaining sparsity. We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework. Furthermore, we empirically show that our algorithm can produce highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks. We also show that the theoretical number of FLOPs compared to SGD training can be reduced from 38% for standard Bregman iterations to 6% for our method while maintaining test accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MatGPTQ introduces a post-training quantization method that creates a single model checkpoint optimized for multiple precisions, enabling efficient multi-precision deployment without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) enables single models to serve multiple precisions by slicing bits at inference, but existing methods require expensive quantization-aware training, lack open-source support, and have no efficient kernel implementation.

Method: MatGPTQ formulates Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, performs budget-aware search for per-layer bit-widths, and provides efficient kernels for slicing and mixed-precision execution.

Result: MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while significantly improving low-bit-width performance across standard LLMs and benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art for post-training Matryoshka quantization.

Conclusion: The work makes single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment practical and open-source, addressing previous limitations of MatQuant with an efficient post-training quantization pipeline.

Abstract: Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, "sliceable" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM retrosynthesis evaluation are limited - they rely on published procedures and Top-K accuracy with single ground-truth, which doesn't capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning.

Method: Propose new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis with ChemCensor metric for chemical plausibility, and introduce CREED dataset with millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training.

Result: Trained model using CREED dataset shows improvement over LLM baselines under the new benchmark framework.

Conclusion: Emphasizing plausibility over exact match better aligns with human synthesis planning practices, providing more realistic evaluation of LLM retrosynthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog computing systems offer potential for energy-efficient machine learning, but training them faces challenges due to physical locality constraints that prevent backpropagation. Existing local learning algorithms like Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning need improvement for practical implementation.

Method: Developed an algorithm using graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws to exactly calculate gradients. Introduced Generalized Equilibrium Propagation framework that encompasses various Hebbian learning algorithms. Demonstrated through numerical simulations of resistor network training.

Result: Successfully trained resistor networks without needing replica networks or readout over all resistors - only requiring output layer measurements. Showed that under analytical gradient approach, updating only a subset of resistance values doesn't strongly degrade performance.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm enables efficient training of analog computing systems while respecting physical locality constraints, offering a practical solution for energy-efficient machine learning hardware with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

Motivation: Current unlearning verification methods rely on backdooring techniques that require participation in initial training, which is inefficient and impractical. There's a need for verification methods that don't require involvement in the model's training phase.

Method: EVE perturbs unlearning data to ensure model predictions change before/after unlearning. Perturbations are designed to ensure unlearning effect and alter predictions of target samples. This is formalized as an adversarial optimization problem solved by aligning unlearning gradient with gradient of boundary change for target samples.

Result: EVE successfully verifies machine unlearning without requiring initial training involvement, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offers significant speedup in efficiency, and enhances verification accuracy.

Conclusion: EVE provides a novel, efficient verification method for machine unlearning that overcomes the limitations of backdoor-based approaches by enabling verification without participation in initial training.

Abstract: Verifying whether the machine unlearning process has been properly executed is critical but remains underexplored. Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning.

*Pi-Ju Tsai,Charkkri Limbud,Kuan-Fu Chen,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NPCNet is a deep clustering network that integrates temporal EHR data to identify clinically distinct sepsis phenotypes, enabling more precise treatment strategies by differentiating patient trajectories and treatment responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis is heterogeneous but current clustering approaches often lack clinical relevance, limiting their ability to identify truly distinct phenotypes that could inform targeted treatment strategies.

Method: NPCNet - a novel deep clustering network with a target navigator that integrates temporal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to better align sepsis phenotypes with clinical significance.

Result: Identified four sepsis phenotypes (α, β, γ, δ) with divergent SOFA trajectories. NPCNet effectively differentiated patients likely to improve (α) from those at risk of deterioration (δ) despite similar early severe conditions. Treatment effect analysis revealed α, β, and δ phenotypes may benefit from early vasopressor administration.

Conclusion: NPCNet enhances precision treatment strategies by uncovering clinically distinct sepsis phenotypes that better reflect patient trajectories and treatment responses, potentially enabling more targeted interventions.

Abstract: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identifying clinically distinct phenotypes may enable more precise treatment strategies. In recent years, many researchers have applied clustering algorithms to sepsis patients. However, the clustering process rarely incorporates clinical relevance, potentially limiting to reflect clinically distinct phenotypes. We propose NPCNet, a novel deep clustering network with a target navigator that integrates temporal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to better align sepsis phenotypes with clinical significance. We identify four sepsis phenotypes ($α$, $β$, $γ$, and $δ$) with divergence in SOFA trajectories. Notably, while $α$ and $δ$ phenotypes both show severe conditions in the early stage, NPCNet effectively differentiates patients who are likely to improve ($α$) from those at risk of deterioration ($δ$). Furthermore, through the treatment effect analysis, we discover that $α$, $β$, and $δ$ phenotypes may benefit from early vasopressor administration. The results show that NPCNet enhances precision treatment strategies by uncovering clinically distinct phenotypes.

*Tao Ren,Xiaoyu Luo,Qiongxiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APEX introduces activation perturbation as a new probing method that perturbs hidden activations while keeping inputs and parameters fixed, enabling better access to structural information in neural network representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probing methods (input-space analysis and parameter perturbation) have fundamental limitations in accessing structural information encoded in intermediate representations of neural networks.

Method: Activation Perturbation for EXploration (APEX) - an inference-time probing paradigm that perturbs hidden activations while keeping both inputs and model parameters fixed. Theoretically shows this induces transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure.

Result: In small-noise regime: APEX provides lightweight measure of sample regularity aligning with established metrics, distinguishes structured from randomly labeled models, reveals semantically coherent prediction transitions. In large-noise regime: exposes training-induced model-level biases, including concentration of predictions on target class in backdoored models.

Conclusion: APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone, providing better access to structural information in intermediate representations.

Abstract: Prior work on probing neural networks primarily relies on input-space analysis or parameter perturbation, both of which face fundamental limitations in accessing structural information encoded in intermediate representations. We introduce Activation Perturbation for EXploration (APEX), an inference-time probing paradigm that perturbs hidden activations while keeping both inputs and model parameters fixed. We theoretically show that activation perturbation induces a principled transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure, and further establish that input perturbation corresponds to a constrained special case of this framework. Through representative case studies, we demonstrate the practical advantages of APEX. In the small-noise regime, APEX provides a lightweight and efficient measure of sample regularity that aligns with established metrics, while also distinguishing structured from randomly labeled models and revealing semantically coherent prediction transitions. In the large-noise regime, APEX exposes training-induced model-level biases, including a pronounced concentration of predictions on the target class in backdoored models. Overall, our results show that APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring, and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone.

*Yaguo Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Xiaoyu Tao,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoGenCast is a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching for time series forecasting, enabling both semantic context modeling and continuous stochastic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either use LLMs for semantic context modeling or diffusion models for continuous probabilistic generation, but neither can adequately model both aspects simultaneously for time series forecasting.

Method: Reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into encoder-decoder backbone by modifying attention topology, then integrate flow-matching mechanism to model temporal evolution conditioned on autoregressively generated representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous baselines and naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training.

Conclusion: CoGenCast effectively combines LLMs' semantic understanding with flow-matching's stochastic modeling capabilities for superior time series forecasting performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/liuyaguo/_CoGenCast.

*Alessandro Micheli,Yueqi Cao,Anthea Monod,Samir Bhatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps for optimal transport on manifolds, overcoming the curse of dimensionality faced by discretization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural optimal transport methods are limited to Euclidean geometry and don't work well on high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Discretization-based approaches suffer from exponential parameter growth with dimension.

Method: Proposes RNOT maps - continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction.

Result: Proves RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in dimension (vs exponential for discretization methods). Experiments show improved scalability and competitive performance.

Conclusion: RNOT provides a practical solution for neural optimal transport on manifolds that avoids the curse of dimensionality through continuous neural parameterization with geometric structure.

Abstract: Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.

*Antonino Emanuele Scurria,Dimitri Vanden Abeele,Bortolo Matteo Mognetti,Serge Massar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Propagation extended to nonconservative systems with exact gradient computation, outperforming previous methods on MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is limited to conservative systems with energy functions, but many important applications involve nonconservative systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to extend EP to such systems failed to compute exact gradients.

Method: Proposed framework modifies EP dynamics during learning by adding a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of interactions to obtain exact gradients. Also developed variational formulation using energy function over augmented state space to generate learning dynamics.

Result: Numerical experiments on MNIST database show the algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals for nonconservative systems.

Conclusion: Successfully extended Equilibrium Propagation to arbitrary nonconservative systems including feedforward networks while maintaining key property of using stationary states for both inference and learning, with exact gradient computation.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.

*Bixing Wu,Yuhong Zhao,Zongli Ye,Jiachen Lian,Xiangyu Yue,Gopala Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AHA framework uses asymmetric hierarchical anchoring with audio RVQ as semantic anchor to guide video feature distillation, achieving better cross-modal generalization than symmetric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetric frameworks for audio-visual cross-modal generalization suffer from information allocation ambiguity and semantic-specific leakage across modalities due to lack of structural inductive bias.

Method: Proposes Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA) that designates structured semantic anchor (audio RVQ hierarchy) to guide video feature distillation into shared semantic space. Uses GRL-based adversarial decoupler to suppress semantic leakage and Local Sliding Alignment for fine-grained temporal alignment.

Result: Outperforms symmetric baselines on AVE and AVVP benchmarks for cross-modal transfer. Talking-face disentanglement experiments show improved semantic consistency and disentanglement in learned representations.

Conclusion: AHA framework effectively addresses information allocation ambiguity in cross-modal generalization through asymmetric hierarchical anchoring, demonstrating broader applicability for audio-visual representation learning.

Abstract: Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.

*Simon Dietz,Kai Klede,An Nguyen,Bjoern M Eskofier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContraLog is a parser-free, self-supervised method for log anomaly detection that predicts continuous message embeddings instead of discrete template IDs, using masked language modeling and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional log anomaly detection methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: ContraLog combines a message encoder for rich embeddings of individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies. It's trained using masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on surrounding context.

Result: Experiments on HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets show effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context.

Conclusion: ContraLog demonstrates embedding-level prediction as an effective approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences beyond log analysis.

Abstract: Log files record computational events that reflect system state and behavior, making them a primary source of operational insights in modern computer systems. Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences.

*Huaguan Chen,Ning Lin,Luxi Chen,Rui Zhang,Wenbing Huang,Chongxuan Li,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework for inverse design in physics-based optimization, connecting optimal design points and distributions to optimization and guided generation, with new methods for cost prediction, density-gradient optimization, and covariance estimation validated on aerodynamic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging due to the coupling of high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, particularly in aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. The paper aims to bridge the gap between optimization and guided generation approaches.

Method: The authors propose: 1) A new training loss for cost predictors, 2) A density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes, 3) Unification of existing training-free guided generation methods, and 4) A time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation to address high-dimensional conditional covariance approximation.

Result: Experiments on controlled 2D studies and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft) show consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Validation includes OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies optimization and guided generation for inverse design, providing effective methods for physics-based shape optimization with demonstrated improvements in aerodynamic applications and broader applicability shown through offline RL results.

Abstract: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper identifies that slow power-law convergence in LLM training originates from softmax and cross-entropy when learning peaked probability distributions, leading to a universal 1/3 exponent scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is computationally expensive due to slow power-law convergence, but the underlying cause of this phenomenon remains unclear and debated in the field.

Method: The authors conduct systematic analysis of toy models combined with empirical evaluation of actual LLMs to investigate the optimization dynamics of softmax and cross-entropy components.

Result: When learning peaked probability distributions (like next-token distributions), softmax and cross-entropy produce power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck that leads to power-law time scaling with universal exponent 1/3.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling laws and suggests new directions for improving LLM training efficiency by addressing the fundamental optimization bottleneck identified.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.

*Mattia Sabella,Alberto Archetti,Pietro Pinoli,Matteo Matteucci,Cinzia Cappiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuAIL improves tabular ML robustness by incorporating feature reliability priors into training via a learnable feature-modulation layer with quality-dependent regularization, without needing instance-wise quality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular ML systems often face non-uniform corruption (noise, missing values, biases) but typically only have column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting existing robustness and cleaning techniques.

Method: QuAIL adds a learnable feature-modulation layer to existing models with quality-dependent proximal regularizer that selectively constrains updates based on feature reliability priors, enabling controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness.

Result: Evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets shows QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with particularly robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning, stabilizing optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting.

Abstract: Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning.

*Cristian Manca,Christian Scano,Giorgio Piras,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAGE-5GC, a security-aware evaluation framework for anomaly detectors in 5G Core networks, testing them against realistic adversarial attacks using genetic algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML-based anomaly detection systems for 5G Core networks are evaluated under unrealistic assumptions (IID data, no adaptive attackers), which don't reflect real-world operational environments where attackers can manipulate traffic to evade detection.

Method: Proposed SAGE-5GC guidelines for evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core networks. First trained anomaly detectors on realistic 5G Core dataset and tested baseline performance. Then extended evaluation to adversarial settings where attackers manipulate observable features while preserving malicious functionality. Used randomized perturbations to analyze model sensitivity, then introduced genetic algorithm-based optimization strategy that operates only on attacker-controllable features without requiring detector knowledge.

Result: Adversarially crafted attacks using the proposed genetic algorithm approach substantially degraded detection performance, demonstrating that current anomaly detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks in realistic deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: There's a critical need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in real-world environments, as current approaches are vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks that can bypass detection while maintaining malicious functionality.

Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a pretrain-then-finetune Transformer approach for small-data, large-scale decision problems, using synthetic data for pretraining and real data for finetuning, with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of making many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across large product portfolios) with only few, potentially noisy data points per instance, inspired by LLM success.

Method: Designed Transformer model with pretrain-then-finetune approach: pretrained on large-scale domain-informed synthetic data encoding managerial knowledge, then fine-tuned on real observations. Includes problem-specific architectural design and tailored training.

Result: Develops first comprehensive error analysis for Transformer learning in relevant contexts with nonasymptotic guarantees. Shows pretraining and finetuning jointly determine performance, with finetuning exhibiting economies-of-scale effect where transfer learning becomes more effective as instances grow.

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively addresses small-data, large-scale decision problems by combining synthetic data pretraining with real data finetuning, leveraging Transformer architecture with theoretical validation of effectiveness.

Abstract: We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual explanations in MLaaS systems strengthen membership inference attacks; proposed defense combines differential privacy with active learning to balance privacy, utility, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in MLaaS are vulnerable to privacy attacks, and the impact of counterfactual explanations on this threat landscape is not well understood. There's a need to understand how explanations expand attack surfaces and design defenses that maintain utility and explainability.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis of how exposing counterfactual explanations through APIs enables more effective shadow-based membership inference attacks. 2) Proposed defense framework integrating Differential Privacy with Active Learning to reduce memorization and limit training data exposure. 3) Extensive empirical evaluation of the privacy-utility-explainability trade-off.

Result: Counterfactual explanations strengthen membership inference attacks in MLaaS systems. The proposed DP+AL defense framework helps mitigate this risk while maintaining predictive performance and explanation quality.

Conclusion: Careful balancing of transparency, utility, and privacy is essential for responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems. Counterfactual explanations expand attack surfaces, requiring integrated privacy-preserving approaches.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are increasingly integrated into Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems to improve transparency; however, ML models deployed via APIs are already vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model extraction, and the impact of explanations on this threat landscape remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.

*Alexandru Meterez,Pranav Ajit Nair,Depen Morwani,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anytime learning schedules with weight averaging achieve comparable performance to horizon-dependent cosine schedules for LLM pretraining, offering a practical horizon-free alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM pretraining relies on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules that require extensive tuning for fixed compute budgets, which is impractical for continual/open-ended training where total training horizon is unknown.

Method: Theoretical analysis of anytime schedules for overparameterized linear regression, highlighting weight averaging's role in achieving minimax convergence rates. Empirical evaluation of 150M-300M parameter LLMs trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and 1/√t schedules with weight averaging against tuned cosine schedules.

Result: Anytime schedules with weight averaging achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay across full training range. Theoretical analysis shows these schedules polynomially decay with time, with decay rate determined by problem's source and capacity conditions.

Conclusion: Weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

*Dario Malchiodi,Mattia Ferraretto,Marco Frasca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel quantization-aware training method that uses per-layer regularization to naturally cluster weights during training, integrating quantization directly into the optimization process to reduce accuracy loss while maintaining compression benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have become increasingly large and over-parameterized, creating deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices. While weight quantization is an effective compression technique, it typically causes significant accuracy drops and is usually applied post-training without influencing the learning process.

Method: The authors introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This approach embeds quantization representatives as network parameters, making it the first method to incorporate quantization parameters directly into backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, showing reduced accuracy loss compared to typical quantization methods while preserving compression potential.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel quantization-aware training framework that naturally integrates quantization into the learning process, reducing the accuracy drop typically associated with quantization while maintaining compression benefits, representing a significant advancement in model compression techniques.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks reached state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, but this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large and over-parameterized models, posing serious challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: Phys-Instruct: A physics-guided distillation framework that compresses diffusion-based PDE solvers into few-step generators while enhancing physical consistency through explicit PDE knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for solving PDEs but suffer from high sampling costs (many-step iterative sampling) and insufficient physical consistency due to lack of explicit physics constraints.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) Distills pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into few-step generator by matching generator and prior diffusion distributions, (2) Enhances physics consistency via PDE distillation guidance that explicitly injects PDE knowledge. Built on solid theoretical foundation with tractable gradient training objective.

Result: Achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8× compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines across five PDE benchmarks. The resulting unconditional student model serves as compact prior for efficient, physically consistent downstream conditional tasks.

Conclusion: Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models, addressing key limitations of diffusion-based PDE solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive accuracy and generalization in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models.

*Rajat Masiwal,Colin Aitken,Adam Marchakitus,Mayank Gupta,Katherine Kowal,Hamid A. Pahlavan,Tyler Yang,Y. Qiang Sun,Michael Kremer,Amir Jina,William R. Boos,Pedram Hassanzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI weather prediction models outperform traditional methods but lack decision-oriented evaluation. A new framework connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences to assess agricultural benefits, demonstrated through Indian monsoon forecasting that informed government action for 38 million farmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI weather prediction (AIWP) models outperform traditional physics-based models but are evaluated mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented frameworks. There's a need to connect meteorology, AI, and social sciences to make AIWP models more useful for vulnerable populations facing weather shocks.

Method: The authors introduce a decision-oriented benchmarking framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. They apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on agriculturally relevant onset indices. The framework evaluates AIWP models using deterministic and probabilistic metrics at regional scales weeks in advance, with out-of-sample testing.

Result: AIWP models skillfully predict agriculturally relevant monsoon onset indices at regional scales weeks in advance. The framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send AI-based monsoon onset forecasts to 38 million Indian farmers, successfully capturing an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression.

Conclusion: The decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change, demonstrating practical impact through government adoption and farmer outreach.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTTVAE+TBS: A conditional transformer-based VAE for imbalanced tabular data generation using class-aware triplet loss and training-by-sampling to improve minority class representation and downstream utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for tabular data either overlook minority groups or fail to produce useful samples for downstream learning, especially in domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making (healthcare, fraud detection, predictive maintenance).

Method: CTTVAE (Conditional Transformer-based Tabular VAE) with two key components: 1) class-aware triplet margin loss for better latent space structure (intra-class compactness, inter-class separation), and 2) training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups.

Result: Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity. It bridges the gap between interpolation-based sampling and deep generative methods.

Conclusion: By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries where small gains in minority cases are critical.

Abstract: Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.

TL;DR: UniGeM is a unified data curation framework that treats data mixing and selection as manifold approximation, achieving 2x data efficiency and improved performance over SOTA methods for LLM scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM scaling is increasingly limited by data quality, and existing methods handle data mixing and sample selection separately, which can break the structure in code corpora. There's a need for a unified approach that doesn't require training proxy models or external reference datasets.

Method: UniGeM treats data curation as a manifold approximation problem with a hierarchical approach: 1) Macro-Exploration learns mixing weights using stability-based clustering, and 2) Micro-Mining filters high-quality instances based on their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency.

Result: Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves 2.0x data efficiency over random baselines and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: UniGeM provides an effective unified framework for data curation that addresses the data quality bottleneck in LLM scaling, offering significant efficiency gains and performance improvements without requiring proxy models or external datasets.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality.

*Yicheng Zhang,Zhen Qin,Zhaomin Wu,Wenqi Zhang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to optimize retrievers in RAG systems by addressing two key challenges: deterministic retrieval incompatibility and state aliasing in multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retriever optimization methods suffer from objective mismatch with RAG pipeline goals, and reinforcement learning offers a promising solution but faces challenges with deterministic retrieval and state aliasing in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling, formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, and incorporate retrieval history into state representation to mitigate state aliasing.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements in RAG performance.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based approach effectively optimizes retrievers in RAG systems by addressing fundamental challenges, leading to improved evidence-based response generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.

*Aneri Muni,Vincent Taboga,Esther Derman,Pierre-Luc Bacon,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel Bellman operator formulation for static CVaR in RL with dense rewards and contraction properties, enabling practical risk-averse algorithms with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static CVaR is important for safety-critical applications to prevent catastrophic events, but existing approaches using state augmentation lead to sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points, making practical algorithms difficult.

Method: Proposes a novel formulation of static CVaR objective using state augmentation that yields a Bellman operator with dense per-step rewards and contraction properties on bounded value functions. Develops risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms with discretized augmented states.

Result: Theoretical foundation provides convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds for discretization. Empirical results show successful learning of CVaR-sensitive policies and effective performance-safety trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing CVaR formulations in RL, enabling practical risk-averse algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs.

*Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Daniel Kunin,Adele Myers,Francisco Acosta,Nina Miolane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks learn sequential group composition tasks by decomposing them into irreducible representations, with depth enabling efficient computation through associativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks acquire structured computational abilities like arithmetic and algorithmic operations when trained on sequences.

Method: Introduce sequential group composition task where networks predict cumulative product of group elements; analyze two-layer networks, RNNs, and multilayer networks; use Fourier analysis and representation theory.

Result: Two-layer networks learn task one irreducible representation at a time, requiring exponential width; deeper networks exploit associativity: RNNs compute in k steps, multilayer networks in log k layers.

Conclusion: Sequential group composition provides tractable framework to study deep learning mechanics, revealing how network depth enables efficient structured computation through associativity.

Abstract: How do neural networks trained over sequences acquire the ability to perform structured operations, such as arithmetic, geometric, and algorithmic computation? To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task. In this task, networks receive a sequence of elements from a finite group encoded in a real vector space and must predict their cumulative product. The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning.

### [487] [Efficient Estimation of Kernel Surrogate Models for Task Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03783)
*Zhenshuo Zhang,Minxuan Duan,Hongyang R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kernel surrogate models outperform linear models for task attribution by capturing nonlinear task interactions, achieving 25% higher correlation with ground truth and 40% improvement in downstream task selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear surrogate models for task attribution miss important nonlinear interactions between training tasks (synergy, antagonism, XOR effects), limiting their ability to accurately quantify how individual tasks influence target task performance.

Method: Proposes kernel surrogate models to capture second-order task interactions, with a gradient-based estimation procedure using first-order approximations of pretrained models for efficient learning without repeated retraining.

Result: Kernel surrogate models achieve <2% relative error, 25% higher correlation with leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates, and yield 40% improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: Kernel surrogate models provide a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to linear models for task attribution, effectively capturing nonlinear task interactions and improving downstream task selection performance.

Abstract: Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: Cobalt: A contextual bandit learning method combining online and offline RL for multi-turn code generation, achieving significant performance improvements on LiveCodeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online RL performs better than offline RL for training LLMs on real-world tasks like multi-turn code generation, but suffers from high training costs and instability. The paper aims to combine benefits of both approaches.

Method: Formulates multi-turn code generation as one-step recoverable MDP. First collects code generation trajectories using reference LLM, divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then trains LLM through online bandit learning to complete each partial trajectory via single-step code generation. Augments training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate in-context reward hacking.

Result: Outperforms multi-turn online RL baselines (GRPO and VeRPO). Improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Successfully mitigates in-context reward hacking behaviors.

Conclusion: Cobalt demonstrates a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation, effectively combining benefits of online and offline RL while addressing training cost and stability issues.

Abstract: Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

*Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Lian Wen,David Chen,Shaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CL3AN-GNN: A curriculum-guided three-stage attention network for imbalanced node classification in GNNs, using human-like learning progression from simple to complex features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced node classification in GNNs causes unfair learning and poor performance on minority classes due to label skew, requiring specialized approaches to handle structural and attribute imbalances.

Method: Three-stage attention network (Engage, Enact, Embed) with curriculum learning: Engage focuses on simple features (1-hop patterns, low-degree nodes, class-separable pairs); Enact handles complex aspects (multi-hop connections, heterophilic edges, minority class boundaries); Embed consolidates via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting.

Result: Consistent improvements across 8 OGB datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over SOTA methods, with faster convergence, better generalization to new imbalanced graphs, and interpretable learning curves.

Conclusion: CL3AN-GNN provides both theoretical framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalization tests across diverse graph domains.

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADFP is a new fingerprinting method that detects when student models train on teacher outputs, achieving better detection with less utility loss than existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fingerprinting methods for detecting model distillation require significant utility degradation to ensure effective fingerprinting, creating a steep trade-off between generation quality and detection strength.

Method: ADFP uses a gradient-based framework with a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that maximize expected fingerprint detectability in the student after fine-tuning, aligning with the student's learning dynamics rather than relying on incidental bias absorption.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks show ADFP achieves significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, providing stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even with unknown student architectures.

Conclusion: ADFP offers a principled approach to fingerprinting that effectively balances detection strength and utility preservation, addressing limitations of existing heuristic-based methods.

Abstract: Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.

*Romain Cosentino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLATE is a continual learning method for pretrained models that requires no access to old-task data, using geometric redundancy in pretrained networks to create protected update subspaces with explicit plasticity-retention trade-off control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable, and old-task data cannot be accessed during continual learning.

Method: Exploits geometric redundancy in pretrained networks: 1) uses redundant neurons as proxy for dominant pretraining feature directions to construct protected update subspaces, 2) restricts updates to subset of redundant neurons while constraining remaining degrees of freedom. Implements PLATE with structured low-rank update ΔW = B A Q⊤ where B and Q are computed once from pretrained weights and frozen, and only A is trained on new tasks.

Result: Achieves reduced functional drift on old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees, with explicit control over plasticity-retention trade-off without requiring past-task data.

Conclusion: PLATE provides an effective continual learning solution for pretrained models that operates without access to old-task data, leveraging inherent geometric redundancy in pretrained networks to balance plasticity and retention through structured low-rank updates.

Abstract: We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \textsc{PLATE} (\textbf{Pla}sticity-\textbf{T}unable \textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $ΔW = B A Q^\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task.

TL;DR: CoRSA is a parameter-efficient training framework for knowledge editing in LLMs that improves generalization, stability across multiple updates, and resolves knowledge conflicts through sharpness-aware minimization and margin maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to stay up-to-date with new knowledge, but full retraining is expensive. Existing efficient alternatives like model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often fail due to poor generalization, limited stability, and knowledge conflicts.

Method: CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) framework uses parameter-efficient training that simultaneously: 1) minimizes loss curvature to improve generalization and stability, and 2) maximizes margin between new and prior knowledge to resolve conflicts.

Result: On three fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves 12.42% average improvement over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods in generalization. With multiple updates, it reduces catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. It also generalizes to code domain with 5.48% Pass@5 improvement.

Conclusion: CoRSA provides a holistic, parameter-efficient solution for knowledge editing that effectively addresses generalization, stability, and conflict resolution challenges, outperforming existing methods across multiple domains and update scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.

*Dylan Sandfelder,Mihai Cucuringu,Xiaowen Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Spectral Shaping learns reusable spectral kernels modulated by Gaussian factors for multi-peak, multi-scale graph filtering, with transferable version enabling few-shot adaptation across graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create scalable, interpretable graph filtering methods that can handle heterogeneous spectral regions while enabling cross-graph generalization through transfer learning.

Method: Learn a reusable baseline spectral kernel modulated by Gaussian factors for multi-peak responses, implement with Chebyshev expansions for scalability, and propose TASS for transfer learning where baseline kernel is fixed and only shaping parameters are adapted.

Result: Reduces reconstruction error compared to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer across graph families and signal regimes.

Conclusion: Provides compact, interpretable spectral modules that combine scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization for graph signal processing and GNNs.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.

*Henrik Schopmans,Christopher von Klitzing,Pascal Friederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR) to improve data efficiency in training Boltzmann generators for sampling from physical system Boltzmann distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boltzmann generators need data-efficient training because both simulation data and target energy evaluations are computationally expensive, limiting their practical application.

Method: Off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR) framework that generalizes the log-variance objective, acting as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape using target energy labels without requiring additional on-policy samples.

Result: LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency across benchmarks, achieving sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.

Conclusion: LDR is a broadly applicable regularization framework that enhances Boltzmann generator training efficiency, supporting various training scenarios including biased/unbiased simulation datasets and purely variational training.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.

*Themistoklis Haris,Steve Choi,Mutiraj Laksanawisit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Accelerated MWEM framework reduces per-iteration runtime from Θ(m) to Θ(√m) using lazy sampling with Gumbel noise and k-NN data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MWEM's scalability is limited by Θ(m) time complexity for exponential mechanism in each iteration, which becomes prohibitive for large m.

Method: Modified MWEM with lazy sampling approach to Report-Noisy-Max mechanism using Gumbel noise and k-Nearest Neighbor data structure for rapid approximate score selection.

Result: Achieves expected Θ(√m) per-iteration runtime instead of Θ(m), with experimental confirmation of substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.

Conclusion: The accelerated MWEM framework enables scalable private data analysis for linear query release and LP solving under privacy constraints.

Abstract: The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $Θ(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.

Abstract: Monitoring bottom-hole variables in petroleum wells is essential for production optimization, safety, and emissions reduction. Permanent Downhole Gauges (PDGs) provide real-time pressure data but face reliability and cost issues. We propose a machine learning-based soft sensor to estimate flowing Bottom-Hole Pressure (BHP) using wellhead and topside measurements. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is introduced and compared with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Ridge Regression. We also pioneer Transfer Learning for adapting models across operational environments. Tested on real offshore datasets from Brazil's Pre-salt basin, the methodology achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) consistently below 2\%, outperforming benchmarks. This work offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative to physical sensors, with broad applicability across diverse reservoir and flow conditions.

### [497] [Reasoning with Latent Tokens in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03769)
*Andre He,Sean Welleck,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models outperform autoregressive models on reasoning tasks but are slower; joint prediction of all tokens (including undecoded ones) is key to their success, and this mechanism can be adapted to improve autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why discrete diffusion models outperform autoregressive models on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, despite being computationally slower at inference, and to find ways to transfer their advantages to autoregressive models.

Method: Analyzed the joint prediction mechanism in diffusion models, introduced latent tokens with adjustable quantity to control speed-quality tradeoff, and developed an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective for autoregressive models to incorporate latent token reasoning.

Result: Latent tokens enable smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality in diffusion models, and when introduced into autoregressive models via multi-token prediction, they yield substantial improvements on reasoning tasks where autoregressive models traditionally struggle.

Conclusion: Latent tokens, while naturally occurring in diffusion models, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead, and can be successfully adapted to enhance autoregressive models.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.

*Ian Wu,Yuxiao Qu,Amrith Setlur,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RC is an iterative decoding algorithm that enables LLMs to continually improve beyond training budgets by constructing reasoning chains that get better across iterations, allowing extrapolation to much longer reasoning horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, limiting LLMs' ability to extrapolate and adapt to distribution shift at test time. The authors want LLMs that can continually improve beyond their training budgets.

Method: RC (iterative decoding algorithm) replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. It exploits an asymmetry between response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations.

Result: Models trained with RC can extrapolate to reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than seen during training. A 4B model trained with RC using 16k-token budget improved HMMT 2025 performance from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m test tokens, outperforming comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: RC enables LLMs to continually improve beyond training budgets through iterative decoding, and models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds for further test-time performance scaling due to improved summary-conditioned generation abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.

*Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury,Rahul Kidambi,Avinava Dubey,David Wang,Gokhan Mergen,Amr Ahmed,Aranyak Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new inference-time unlearning framework using verifier feedback and conformal prediction to remove specific information from generative models without parameter updates, achieving 93% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods with provable guarantees often fail in real-world generative model applications, degrade model capabilities, and require parameter retraining which is impractical.

Method: Inference-time unlearning with verifier feedback: uses an approximately correct verifier to judge responses, iteratively refines generation quality using verifier feedback without parameter updates, and leverages conformal prediction for computational efficiency and distribution-free guarantees.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging benchmarks while maintaining model capabilities.

Conclusion: The inference-time unlearning paradigm with verifier feedback and conformal prediction provides a practical, efficient solution for machine unlearning in generative models that preserves pre-trained capabilities while offering strong guarantees.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.

TL;DR: Synthetic data has limitations in three key use cases: sharing proprietary data, augmenting ML training, and reducing statistical variance. Many existing use cases are poor fits due to fundamental and practical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine whether synthetic data truly solves problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation, as many assume it does based on recent generative modeling advances.

Method: Formal analysis and case studies examining three prominent use cases: (1) sharing synthetic data as proxy for proprietary datasets, (2) augmenting ML training sets, and (3) reducing variance in statistical estimation.

Result: Identifies fundamental and practical limits constraining when synthetic data can be effective. Reveals that many existing or envisioned use cases are poor problem fits due to these limitations.

Conclusion: Provides formalizations and classification of synthetic data use cases to help decision makers assess whether synthetic data is suitable for their specific data availability problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.

TL;DR: A new method called Manifold Random Features (MRFs) for approximating bi-variate functions/kernels on general manifolds by leveraging graph discretization and Graph Random Features (GRFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create random features for approximating kernels on general manifolds where continuous approximation mechanisms cannot be derived analytically in general scenarios.

Method: MRFs discretize the manifold and use Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds, providing positive and bounded features for accurate approximation.

Result: The method shows deep asymptotic connection between GRFs and continuous random features, re-discovers Gaussian kernel approximation mechanisms, and provides rigorous theoretical analysis with experimental verification.

Conclusion: MRFs offer a new paradigm for kernel approximation on manifolds with positive bounded features, connecting discrete graph methods with continuous kernel theory.

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.

*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models trained on tube CHF data successfully generalize to predict CHF in rod bundles, outperforming traditional correlations and lookup tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CHF prediction methods (empirical correlations, LUTs) have accuracy limitations. While ML models have been developed for tubes, they need to generalize to rod bundles which have more complex thermal-hydraulic phenomena like crossflow and spacer grid effects.

Method: Trained ML models on tube-based CHF data, then tested generalization to rod bundles. Implemented three ML approaches in CTF subchannel code: pure DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models. Evaluated on Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series, comparing against W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT baselines.

Result: All three ML-based approaches produced more accurate CHF magnitude and location predictions than baseline models on average. The hybrid LUT model showed the best performance metrics.

Conclusion: ML models trained on tube data can effectively generalize to rod bundle CHF prediction, with hybrid approaches showing particular promise for improving accuracy over conventional methods.

Abstract: The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics.

TL;DR: SymPlex is a reinforcement learning framework that discovers analytical symbolic solutions to PDEs without ground-truth data, using tree-structured decision-making and a structure-aware Transformer to generate interpretable symbolic expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing numerical and neural approaches approximate PDE solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, lacking interpretability and struggling with non-smooth behavior. There's a need for methods that can discover analytical symbolic solutions that are human-readable, naturally represent non-smooth behavior, and show explicit parametric dependence.

Method: SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and uses SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer with tree-relative self-attention and grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding to ensure syntactic validity. It optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and boundary conditions without ground-truth expressions.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods, showing the framework can discover interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: SymPlex enables interpretable, human-readable symbolic solutions to PDEs that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence, operating directly in symbolic expression space rather than approximating in discretized or implicit function spaces.

Abstract: We propose SymPlex, a reinforcement learning framework for discovering analytical symbolic solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) without access to ground-truth expressions. SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods.

TL;DR: RIFT: Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning for robust learning from noisy human interventions in autonomous systems, combining intervention signals with prior policies to resolve ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human interventions during autonomous system testing provide valuable but often noisy/incomplete signals about policy weaknesses. Current methods struggle when avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for good performance.

Method: Proposes Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with prior policy structure to resolve ambiguity.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows conditions for principled policy improvement and identifies failure regimes. Experiments demonstrate robust, consistent policy improvement across various intervention strategies and prior policy qualities.

Conclusion: Residual fine-tuning enables robust intervention learning, making it a promising direction for future work in autonomous systems where intervention data is available but imperfect.

Abstract: Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.

TL;DR: PULSE: A lossless sparse encoding method that reduces RL weight synchronization bandwidth by 100x by transmitting only modified parameters, enabling decentralized RL to approach centralized throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for large language models faces scalability bottlenecks in distributed settings due to bandwidth-intensive synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, especially over commodity networks or in decentralized environments.

Method: Systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at step-level and multi-step granularities, leading to PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding) - a method that transmits only indices and values of modified parameters using lossless sparse encoding.

Result: Update sparsity consistently exceeds 99% across practical settings. PULSE achieves over 100x communication reduction (14 GB to ~108 MB) while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization.

Conclusion: By exploiting the high sparsity of RL weight updates, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing required bandwidth for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s while maintaining high GPU utilization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.
