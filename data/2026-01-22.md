*Ho Yin Au,Junkun Jiang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOSControl: A symbolic framework using Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) scripts for precise control of body part orientations and motion timing in text-to-motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks lack precise control over body part orientations and motion timing. Existing approaches using joint keyframe locations only provide positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify orientation and timing constraints.

Method: 1) SOS script: Programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. 2) Automatic SOS extraction pipeline: Uses temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts. 3) SOSControl framework: Prioritizes satisfying orientation symbol constraints during motion generation, incorporates SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, and uses ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder for smooth motion outputs.

Result: SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes. SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

Conclusion: The proposed SOSControl framework provides an effective solution for precise control over body part orientations and motion timing in text-to-motion generation, addressing limitations of traditional approaches through symbolic programming and automatic extraction methods.

Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

*Ziwen Zhong,Zhitao Shu,Yue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cloud-based multimodal emotion recognition framework using cross-modal transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance with low latency for real-time HCI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-modality emotion recognition systems have limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments, creating a need for more comprehensive multimodal approaches that can handle real-time interactions at scale.

Method: Proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework that integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) with cross-modal attention mechanisms, deployed on cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving for distributed training and low-latency inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP, MELD, AffectNet) with 3.0% F1-score improvement and 12.9% cross-entropy loss reduction compared to baselines, plus 128ms average response latency (35% reduction from conventional systems).

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback for applications like intelligent customer service and virtual tutoring, representing significant progress toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated systems fail with ultra-high-resolution power grid drawings due to computational demands, information loss, and lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) MLLM for global semantic understanding to propose domain-specific regions from low-resolution overview, 2) high-resolution fine-grained recognition within proposed regions with confidence scores, 3) comprehensive decision-making module integrating confidence-aware results.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings show significant enhancement of MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, with improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review that mimics human expert workflow and addresses limitations of current automated systems.

Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

### [4] [LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14330)
*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Junxu Liu,Haibo Hu,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LURE is a novel concept reawakening method that reconstructs latent space to reawaken erased concepts in diffusion models by addressing gradient conflicts and ensuring stable sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models are vulnerable to reawakening attacks, and current reawakening approaches only focus on prompt-level optimization, neglecting other generative factors like model parameters and latent states.

Method: Models generation as implicit function to analyze multiple factors, proposes LURE with semantic re-binding mechanism for latent space reconstruction, Gradient Field Orthogonalization to prevent feature entanglement in multi-concept scenarios, and Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling for stable reawakening.

Result: Extensive experiments show LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

Conclusion: LURE provides a comprehensive approach to concept reawakening by addressing multiple generative factors and solving multi-concept interference issues, demonstrating vulnerabilities in current erasure methods.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on indoor/street settings but overlook the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces with rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. There's a need to systematically assess VLMs' cross-view reasoning capabilities in realistic urban scenarios.

Method: Created CityCube benchmark with 5,022 annotated multi-view QA pairs across four viewpoint dynamics (mimicking camera movements) and multiple platforms (vehicles, drones, satellites). Categorized questions into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions.

Result: Evaluation of 33 VLMs shows large-scale models struggle (max 54.1% accuracy), 34.2% below human performance. Small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy. Analysis reveals task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparities between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

Conclusion: CityCube effectively exposes limitations in current VLMs' cross-view spatial reasoning in urban environments, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks and showing that fine-tuning can improve performance despite fundamental cognitive gaps.

Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

*Frank Bieder,Hendrik Königshof,Haohao Hu,Fabian Immel,Yinzhe Shen,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XD-MAP transfers semantic knowledge from camera images to LiDAR using a parametric map approach, enabling 360° perception without manual annotation or sensor overlap requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning performance depends on dataset availability and alignment with sensor characteristics. Domain adaptation is needed to bridge gaps between available datasets and deployment domains, especially when transferring knowledge between different sensing modalities like camera images and LiDAR.

Method: XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target LiDAR domain without manual annotation. Unlike previous approaches, it doesn't require direct sensor overlap and extends angular perception from front-view camera to full 360° view.

Result: On large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baselines by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively achieves strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling, demonstrating successful sensor-specific knowledge transfer from camera images to LiDAR domain.

Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current voxelization methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which suffer from excessive computation complexity and brittle, static fusion processes that break down under dynamic environmental settings for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model with four components: 1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation using depth-wise deformable sampling, 2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing using cross-entropy, 3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion with dynamic recalibration, and 4) Gauss-Mamba Head using Selective State Space Models for global context decoding.

Result: The proposed solution bridges semantic strengths of cameras with geometric strengths of LiDAR through memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model, addressing geometric sparsity, domain-specific noise, and enabling dynamic sensor fusion with linear computation complexity.

Conclusion: The research enhances 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous vehicles by overcoming limitations of current voxelization methods through adaptive multimodal fusion and efficient Gaussian representation, improving robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NASA introduces a multi-spectral aerial wildfire dataset and deep learning model for automated fire perimeter detection, achieving 96% accuracy and 74% IoU with real-time segmentation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-altitude multi-spectral aerial imagery is scarce and expensive, yet crucial for wildfire detection applications. Current methods rely on human-intensive fire perimeter determination, creating a need for automated solutions using specialized aerial data.

Method: Created a human-annotated dataset from NASA AMS with 12-channel medium to high altitude aerial wildfire images. Trained two deep neural networks (classification and segmentation) combined into a real-time segmentation model using multi-spectral data including IR, SWIR, and thermal bands.

Result: Model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union (IoU), and 84% recall, surpassing past methods. Can detect wildfires at nighttime and behind clouds while distinguishing false positives. SWIR, IR, and thermal bands identified as most important for fire perimeter detection.

Conclusion: Multi-spectral aerial data enables effective automated wildfire detection with real-time capabilities. The dataset and model advance machine learning applications for high-impact wildfire monitoring, with SWIR/IR/thermal bands proving critical for accurate perimeter determination.

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified OCR system that combines reading, detection, and grounding capabilities in a single checkpoint, addressing limitations of existing OCR systems that often separate these functions and lack grounding capabilities for business documents and scientific articles.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data.

Substantial improvements in region- and line-level OCR and text-detection recall on Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

Conclusion: GutenOCR successfully creates a unified OCR system with strong grounding capabilities, demonstrating significant improvements over base models while identifying specific areas (page linearization, color-guided OCR, formula layouts) that need further refinement for comprehensive OCR performance.

Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [12] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAS-Mamba: A novel MRI reconstruction framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in frequency domain using specialized branches, combines with spatial features via LocalMamba, and uses circular frequency scanning with dual-domain fusion for superior reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction methods treat frequency domain as a whole, neglecting that phase and amplitude carry fundamentally different types of information (phase governs structure, amplitude reflects pixel intensity). Unified frequency-domain modeling causes interference between phase and magnitude feature learning.

Method: 1) Image domain: LocalMamba preserves spatial locality for fine anatomical details. 2) Frequency domain: Separate branches for amplitude and phase modeling to avoid representational coupling. 3) Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) serializes features from low to high frequencies respecting concentric geometry. 4) Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude-phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling phase and magnitude modeling in frequency domain while combining with spatial features through specialized architectures leads to superior MRI reconstruction by respecting the distinct information carried by different frequency components.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: SDT-Net: A dual-teacher, single-student framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that uses dynamic teacher switching and hierarchical consistency to improve boundary learning from sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble-supervised methods reduce annotation burden but suffer from ambiguity due to sparse annotations, leading to noisy pseudo-label propagation and poor anatomical boundary learning.

Method: Proposes SDT-Net with: 1) Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select reliable teacher, 2) Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism for high-confidence pseudo-label refinement, and 3) Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module for multi-level feature alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Conclusion: SDT-Net effectively addresses scribble annotation ambiguity through adaptive teacher selection and hierarchical consistency, demonstrating superior segmentation quality with minimal annotation burden.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

*Wei Ma,Shaowu Chen,Junjie Ye,Peichang Zhang,Lei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fuzzy controller-based framework that dynamically switches between different scale models during video inference to balance resource efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inference enhancement methods focus on scaling up models and complex architectures, but overlook the trade-off between resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal performance.

Method: Develops a fuzzy controller (FC-r) based on key system parameters and inference metrics, then proposes a video inference enhancement framework that leverages spatiotemporal correlation of targets across frames and dynamically switches between models of varying scales based on real-time device resource conditions.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

Conclusion: The fuzzy controller-guided framework successfully addresses the resource-performance trade-off in video inference enhancement by enabling dynamic model switching based on real-time conditions.

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

*Cheng Wan,Bahram Jafrasteh,Ehsan Adeli,Miaomiao Zhang,Qingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-LDM is a segmentation-guided latent diffusion model that simplifies brain MRI progression modeling while ensuring anatomical consistency, outperforming complex multi-stage approaches with better image quality and clinical covariate utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain MRI progression models like BrLP have architectural complexity, suboptimal use of clinical covariates, and limited anatomical consistency guarantees. There's a need for simpler, more anatomically grounded frameworks that better leverage clinical information.

Method: AG-LDM uses a segmentation-guided latent diffusion approach that directly fuses baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at input level. It employs a lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) for anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion training, ensuring consistent tissue boundaries.

Result: On 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and OASIS-3 zero-shot evaluation, AG-LDM matches or surpasses complex diffusion models with state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20% reduction in volumetric errors. It shows 31.5x higher sensitivity to clinical covariates than BrLP and generates biologically plausible Alzheimer's progression trajectories.

Conclusion: AG-LDM provides an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling that simplifies training while improving anatomical consistency and clinical covariate utilization, accurately capturing neurodegenerative disease progression patterns.

Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

Motivation: Deep learning for medical image analysis is limited by the need for expert annotations. While 3D self-supervised methods like VoCo help with label scarcity, they suffer from high computational cost and memory consumption.

Method: Proposes 2D-VoCo, an efficient slice-level adaptation of VoCo that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture for multi-organ injury classification.

Conclusion: 2D-VoCo provides a practical method to reduce dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis, offering computational efficiency over 3D approaches while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) improves video captioning by selecting diverse, event-relevant frames using caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs, achieving up to 4% gains on new human-consistent benchmark ICH-CC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform frame sampling for video captioning is inefficient because it ignores uneven event distribution across time. Current methods enforce equal temporal coverage but fail to capture important events, and existing benchmarks don't align well with human cognition.

Method: LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance diversity and event relevance, using stratified sampling to ensure coverage while avoiding clustering. It learns frame selection by leveraging caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to directly optimize downstream caption quality. Also introduces ICH-CC benchmark with human-designed questions.

Result: LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Enhanced captions also improve video question answering performance.

Conclusion: LFS provides an effective, easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning that addresses limitations of uniform sampling and improves alignment with human cognition through better frame selection.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial scratchpad: A 3D reasoning substrate that enables visual language models to perform spatial reasoning for precise, controllable image generation by parsing text prompts into editable 3D meshes and performing agentic scene planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs benefit from externalizing intermediate thoughts (like chain-of-thought), visual language models lack analogous spatial reasoning mechanisms, limiting their ability to generate images with accurate geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent.

Method: Introduces a spatial scratchpad framework that: 1) parses text prompts into subjects and background elements, 2) instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, 3) performs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection, and 4) renders the 3D arrangement back to images with identity-preserving cues.

Result: Achieves 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench compared to prior methods, demonstrating reliable 3D edits that propagate to final images and enabling spatially consistent, visually coherent outputs.

Conclusion: Proposes a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language but also in space, showing that explicit 3D reasoning significantly improves precise and controllable image generation.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation datasets in clinical practice are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Proposes Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), a joint training method integrated into deep learning architectures with a domain-gated head. The approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. The framework also supports universal modality adaptation for learning new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: U-Harmony enables a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, overcoming challenges of limited and diverse medical data in clinical practice while supporting adaptation to new modalities and anatomical classes.

### [20] [Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610)
*Zhenghong Li,Kecheng Zheng,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-Taxon: A two-stage hierarchical reasoning framework that improves Vision-Language Models' taxonomic classification by enhancing leaf-level accuracy and ensuring hierarchical consistency, achieving >10% improvement over much larger models with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge, leading to errors where they misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying specific leaf levels. Existing approaches overlook hierarchical reasoning in taxonomic classification.

Method: VL-Taxon is a two-stage framework: 1) Top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy, 2) Leveraging accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage uses supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning to refine reasoning and generalization.

Result: VL-Taxon implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-7B outperforms the original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on iNaturalist-2021 dataset. This significant gain was achieved with minimal fine-tuning on a small data subset without using examples from other VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical reasoning framework effectively addresses VLMs' limitations in understanding taxonomic hierarchies, demonstrating that proper modeling of hierarchical relationships can lead to substantial performance improvements even with smaller models and limited training data.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

*Yingsong Huang,Hui Guo,Jing Huang,Bing Bai,Qi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEUA framework uses diffusion epistemic uncertainty estimation and asymmetric learning to detect AI-generated images, achieving state-of-the-art performance by distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion-based detection methods ignore the different impacts of aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error, which undermines detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data noise) creates ambiguity and doesn't help distinguish generated images, while epistemic uncertainty (model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns) actually supports detection.

Method: Proposes DEUA framework with two key components: 1) Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty (DEU) estimation via Laplace approximation to assess data proximity to diffusion-generated manifold, and 2) Asymmetric loss function to train balanced classifier with larger margins for enhanced generalizability.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating superior detection capabilities compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The DEUA framework effectively addresses the limitations of previous approaches by properly distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, leading to improved detection of diffusion-generated images through uncertainty-aware measurements and asymmetric learning.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: Forest-Chat is an LLM-driven agent that integrates vision-language models for comprehensive forest change analysis from satellite imagery, supporting multiple tasks through natural language queries and interactive interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an opportunity to enhance forest monitoring by combining high-resolution satellite imagery with deep learning, but current approaches lack integration of LLMs with vision-language models for remote sensing image change interpretation, especially in complex forest environments beyond urban areas.

Method: Forest-Chat uses an LLM-driven agent framework with multi-level change interpretation vision-language backbone, zero-shot change detection via foundation model, interactive point-prompt interface, and is evaluated on the new Forest-Change dataset with bi-temporal imagery, change masks, and semantic captions.

Result: Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on both the Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees subset for joint change detection and captioning, demonstrating the effectiveness of interactive, LLM-driven systems for forest change analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-driven RSICI system shows potential to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change monitoring through natural language interaction and multi-task support.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ-Net is an audio-visual depression detection framework that addresses Emotional Ambiguity by adaptively recalibrating emotional features to enhance depression-related signals while filtering out irrelevant emotional noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depression detection methods either ignore emotional cues (missing subtle depressive signals) or incorporate emotions but confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms (Emotional Ambiguity), leading to detection errors.

Method: READ-Net uses Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) to dynamically adjust weights of emotional features, identifying and preserving depression-relevant cues within emotional features while filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. It can be integrated into existing frameworks.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three public datasets show READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods with average gains of 4.55% in accuracy and 1.26% in F1-score, demonstrating robustness to emotional disturbances.

Conclusion: READ-Net effectively mitigates Emotional Ambiguity in audio-visual depression detection by adaptively recalibrating emotional features, improving detection performance and robustness to emotional interference.

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirai framework injects foresight (future token information) into autoregressive visual generation training to improve global coherence and accelerate convergence without architecture changes or inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generators suffer from strict causality supervision that only optimizes each step by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. The paper investigates whether foresight (training signals from later tokens) can help AR visual generation.

Method: Proposes Mirai framework with two variants: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, while Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Both inject future information into AR training without architecture changes or extra inference overhead.

Result: Mirai significantly accelerates convergence (up to 10× faster for LlamaGen-B) and improves generation quality (reduces FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on ImageNet class-conditioned image generation). The key insight is that aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on 2D image grids improves causality modeling.

Conclusion: Visual autoregressive models need foresight. The Mirai framework demonstrates that injecting future information during training improves global coherence and accelerates convergence without affecting inference efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAVR-4D uses implicit geometric knowledge from a large 4D reconstruction model's latent space to condition video generation, achieving state-of-the-art video re-rendering without explicit reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video re-rendering methods face two main challenges: geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness and suffer from drift/deformation, while geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them vulnerable to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.

Method: The method leverages implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition video generation. These latents capture scene structure continuously without explicit reconstruction, providing flexible representation that allows pretrained diffusion priors to regularize errors more effectively. The model jointly conditions on these latents and source camera poses.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Using implicit geometric knowledge from 4D reconstruction model latents provides an effective solution for video re-rendering, overcoming limitations of both unconditioned and explicitly conditioned approaches while leveraging the regularization capabilities of diffusion priors.

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

TL;DR: Domain adaptation with DANN improves cross-cancer generalization in histopathology, outperforming supervised models and ensembles, with stain normalization effects varying by target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep learning models in cancer histopathology fail to generalize to unseen cancer types despite shared morphological features, requiring domain adaptation to address domain shift and annotation scarcity.

Method: Evaluated ResNet50 on lung, colon, breast, kidney adenocarcinomas; compared supervised models, ensembles, and domain adversarial neural networks (DANN); tested stain normalization impact; used Integrated Gradients for interpretability.

Result: Single-domain ResNet50 achieves >98% accuracy on own domain but minimal cross-domain generalization. DANN trained on breast/colon and adapted to lung reaches 95.56% accuracy. Stain normalization effects vary: helps breast/colon targets but harms lung adaptation.

Conclusion: DANN enables effective cross-cancer generalization by learning clinically relevant features, with stain normalization requiring domain-specific consideration for optimal adaptation performance.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

*Yian Huang,Qing Qin,Aji Mao,Xiangyu Qiu,Liang Xu,Xian Zhang,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spatio-temporal feedback network (FeedbackSTS-Det) for infrared small target detection that uses sparse frames with closed-loop semantic feedback to improve long-range dependency modeling and robustness in complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection faces challenges from low signal-to-clutter ratios, dynamic interference, and lack of distinct features. Existing multi-frame methods struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness.

Method: Proposes FeedbackSTS-Det with spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy using paired forward/backward refinement modules across encoder-decoder. Includes embedded sparse semantic module (SSM) for structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm effectiveness. The method facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms.

Conclusion: FeedbackSTS-Det overcomes limitations of existing methods through its novel feedback architecture and sparse temporal modeling, achieving reliable performance transfer and increased robustness for infrared small target detection in complex backgrounds.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.

### [29] [RegFreeNet: A Registration-Free Network for CBCT-based 3D Dental Implant Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14703)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ImplantFairy dataset and RegFreeNet model for dental implant position prediction without requiring registration between pre- and post-implantation CBCT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial surgical guide software doesn't export implant positions, requiring time-consuming registration between pre- and post-implantation scans. This limits multi-center dataset construction and relies heavily on registration accuracy.

Method: Mask implants in post-implantation CBCT data to use any implant-containing CBCT as training data. Propose ImplantFairy dataset (1622 CBCTs with voxel-level annotations) and RegFreeNet network with neighboring distance perception module and implant slope prediction branch.

Result: RegFreeNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImplantFairy and two public datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of registration-free approach and slope-aware architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed registration-free paradigm enables large-scale multi-center dataset construction and the slope-aware network effectively predicts implant positions using only post-implantation data with masked implants.

Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LookBench is a live, holistic benchmark for fashion image retrieval using real e-commerce images and AI-generated fashion images, designed to be updated semi-annually with time-stamped samples to prevent contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion retrieval benchmarks are static and don't reflect real e-commerce dynamics, leading to contamination issues and inability to track progress in a rapidly evolving field.

Method: Created a benchmark with time-stamped test samples from live websites and AI-generated images, using a fine-grained attribute taxonomy for single-item and outfit-level retrieval, with periodic updates and contamination-aware evaluation.

Result: LookBench is challenging - many strong baselines achieve below 60% Recall@1. Their proprietary model performs best, with an open-source counterpart ranking second, both achieving SOTA on legacy Fashion200K.

Conclusion: LookBench provides a durable, evolving benchmark for fashion retrieval that reflects real-world e-commerce needs, with public release of leaderboard, dataset, code, and models to drive progress in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

### [31] [Context Patch Fusion With Class Token Enhancement for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14718)
*Yiyang Fu,Hui Li,Wangyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPF-CTE framework improves WSSS by capturing contextual patch dependencies and enhancing class-specific semantics, outperforming previous methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods focus on inter-class distinctions and data augmentation but neglect complex contextual dependencies among image patches, leading to incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes CPF-CTE framework with two key components: 1) CF-BiLSTM module that captures spatial dependencies between patches via bidirectional information flow, and 2) learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues through contextual patch fusion and class token enhancement, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate image representations for weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

TL;DR: HERMES is a training-free architecture for real-time video stream understanding that uses hierarchical KV cache memory to achieve efficient streaming with low GPU memory overhead and fast response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with streaming video inputs - they can't maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead simultaneously. There's a need for models that can handle continuous video streams efficiently.

Method: HERMES conceptualizes KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. It reuses a compact KV cache during inference, enabling efficient streaming understanding without auxiliary computations upon query arrival.

Result: HERMES achieves 10× faster TTFT (Time To First Token) compared to prior SOTA, reduces video tokens by up to 68% compared to uniform sampling while maintaining accuracy, and achieves up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

Conclusion: HERMES provides an effective solution for real-time video stream understanding with superior efficiency and accuracy, addressing the challenges of streaming video processing in MLLMs through a novel hierarchical memory approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

TL;DR: FlowSSC is a generative framework for monocular semantic scene completion that treats SSC as conditional generation, integrates with existing methods, and achieves real-time inference via shortcut flow-matching in triplane latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward methods for SSC from monocular RGB images struggle with generating plausible details in occluded regions and preserving spatial relationships, which is critical for real-world applications like autonomous systems.

Method: FlowSSC treats SSC as conditional generation, integrates with existing feed-forward methods, and introduces Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space to achieve real-time inference with high-fidelity generation in a single step.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI show FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: FlowSSC is the first generative framework for monocular SSC that enables practical deployment in autonomous systems through real-time inference while maintaining high quality.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: DeepMoLM is a dual-view molecular language model that combines high-resolution molecular images with geometric invariants from 3D conformations to generate physically grounded molecular descriptions without requiring atom coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for drug discovery struggle with interpreting molecular images and generating outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. String/graph-based models miss visual information, while vision-language models often overlook stereochemical details and have difficulty mapping continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens.

Method: DeepMoLM uses a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution (1024×1024) molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. It encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints and fuses visual and geometric streams using cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without requiring atom coordinates.

Result: DeepMoLM achieves a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline in PubChem captioning while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE of 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in specialist settings. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: DeepMoLM successfully bridges the gap between molecular vision and language by incorporating geometric invariants from 3D conformations, enabling physically grounded molecular description generation without requiring explicit atom coordinates, making it a promising approach for drug discovery and chemical literature mining.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry.

TL;DR: RBench is a comprehensive robotics benchmark for evaluating robot-oriented video generation across 5 task domains and 4 embodiments, assessing both task correctness and visual fidelity. The paper also introduces RoVid-X, a 4M video clip dataset with physical property annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models for robotics lack standardized evaluation benchmarks, making fair comparisons difficult. There's also a critical shortage of high-quality training data that accurately captures real-world robotic interactions and physical realism.

Method: 1) Developed RBench benchmark with 5 task domains and 4 robot embodiments, using reproducible sub-metrics (structural consistency, physical plausibility, action completeness). 2) Evaluated 25 representative models. 3) Created a refined four-stage data pipeline to produce RoVid-X dataset with 4 million annotated video clips and physical property annotations.

Result: RBench revealed significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. The benchmark achieved 0.96 Spearman correlation with human evaluations. RoVid-X became the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with comprehensive physical annotations.

Conclusion: The synergistic ecosystem of RBench benchmark and RoVid-X dataset establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation and scalable training of video models, accelerating embodied AI toward general intelligence by addressing both evaluation standardization and data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

*Liqin Wang,Qianyue Hu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoidFace is a novel defense method against face swapping attacks that injects imperceptible perturbations to disrupt identity pathways in diffusion models, outperforming existing defenses while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has made face swapping accessible but created privacy and identity security risks. Existing proactive defenses adapted from image editing attacks are ineffective against face swapping systems due to their structural resilience and unique static conditional guidance mechanisms.

Method: VoidFace treats face swapping as a coupled identity pathway and injects perturbations at critical bottlenecks to cause cascading disruption. It uses: 1) localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, 2) attention mechanism decoupling to sever identity injection, and 3) intermediate diffusion feature corruption to prevent source identity reconstruction. The method performs adversarial search in the latent manifold with perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency and image quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that VoidFace outperforms existing defense methods across various diffusion-based face swapping models while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

Conclusion: VoidFace provides an effective systemic defense against face swapping attacks by targeting the unique structural characteristics of diffusion-based systems, offering both strong protection and visual imperceptibility.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative test-time strategy where T2I models progressively refine generations using VLM feedback, improving compositional prompt alignment without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with complex compositional prompts requiring multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies like parallel sampling or increasing denoising steps remain inadequate for richly compositional settings.

Method: An iterative refinement approach where a T2I model progressively refines generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model acting as a critic in the loop. The method requires no external tools or priors and can be flexibly applied to various image generators and VLMs.

Result: 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category), and 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Human evaluators preferred the method 58.7% vs 41.3% for baseline.

Conclusion: Iterative self-correction is a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation, producing more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIGC framework reduces latency by 33% for high-resolution text-to-image generation using end-edge collaboration and region-aware hybrid super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution text-to-image generation faces latency-fidelity trade-off: lightweight SR lacks detail recovery, while diffusion-based SR is computationally expensive. Need to balance quality and speed for better user QoE.

Method: End-edge collaborative framework: edge generates low-res image with adaptive denoising steps and SR scales, then partitions into patches. Region-aware hybrid SR policy applies diffusion-based SR to foreground patches for detail recovery and lightweight learning-based SR to background patches for efficient upscaling, then stitches enhanced patches.

Result: System reduces service latency by 33% compared to baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively addresses the latency-fidelity trade-off in high-resolution T2I generation through intelligent patch-level processing and hybrid SR techniques, achieving significant latency reduction without compromising quality.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

TL;DR: SimD3 is a large-scale synthetic drone detection dataset with realistic distractors and diverse environments that improves drone detection performance, especially when combined with an attention-enhanced YOLOv5 variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone detection faces challenges due to limited real-world annotated data, large appearance variability of drones, and presence of visually similar distractors like birds. Existing synthetic datasets lack realistic modeling of these complexities.

Method: Created SimD3 dataset using Unreal Engine 5 with heterogeneous drone payloads, multiple bird species as distractors, and diverse environments with controlled weather/lighting captured via 360 six-camera rig. Evaluated within YOLOv5 framework with attention-enhanced variant (Yolov5m+C3b) that replaces standard C3 blocks with C3b modules.

Conclusion: SimD3 is a valuable resource for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse challenging conditions, addressing key limitations of existing datasets through realistic synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of MIL and self-supervised learning for automated CCE image analysis, with broader implications for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical VLMs learn diagnostically relevant features, but non-medical VLMs with enhanced text encoders (like LLM2CLIP) produce more refined representations, suggesting text encoder improvement is more crucial than intensive medical image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, but their learned representations remain underexplored. Standard evaluations like classification accuracy don't fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis.

Method: Analyzed feature distributions of multiple image modalities extracted by representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. Compared these distributions with non-medical VLMs to assess domain-specific medical training impact.

Result: Medical VLMs can extract discriminative features effective for medical classification tasks. However, non-medical VLMs with recent improvements in contextual enrichment (like LLM2CLIP) produce more refined feature representations. Non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases from overlaid text strings on images.

Conclusion: Enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Careful model selection is needed according to downstream tasks, with attention to potential risks from background biases like textual information in images.

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

### [43] [M2I2HA: A Multi-modal Object Detection Method Based on Intra- and Inter-Modal Hypergraph Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14776)
*Xiaofan Yang,Yubin Liu,Wei Pan,Guoqing Chu,Junming Zhang,Jie Zhao,Zhuoqi Man,Xuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2I2HA is a hypergraph-based multi-modal perception network that addresses limitations of CNNs, Transformers, and SSMs by capturing high-order relationships within and across modalities for improved object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal detection methods face challenges in extracting task-relevant information, achieving cross-modal alignment, and modeling complex dependencies. CNNs have limited receptive fields, Transformers have quadratic complexity, and SSMs disrupt spatial structures when flattening 2D to 1D sequences.

Method: Proposes M2I2HA with three key modules: 1) Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, 2) Inter-Hypergraph Fusion to align and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps, and 3) M2-FullPAD for adaptive multi-level fusion and enhanced data distribution across the architecture.

Result: Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based approach effectively addresses limitations of existing architectures by capturing complex high-order dependencies within and across modalities, leading to superior multi-modal object detection performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

Conclusion: FunCineForge addresses key limitations in movie dubbing by providing both a scalable dataset creation pipeline and an advanced MLLM-based model that achieves superior performance across diverse cinematic scenes, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM introduces a motion latent space and reconstructive error guidance to improve text-to-motion generation by addressing representational gaps and error propagation in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion diffusion models suffer from two key limitations: (1) representational gap due to pre-trained text encoders lacking motion-specific information, and (2) error propagation during iterative denoising processes.

Method: RAM uses a motion latent space as intermediate supervision with co-training of a motion reconstruction branch using self-regularization and motion-centric latent alignment. Additionally, introduces Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) that exploits the diffusion model's self-correction ability during testing by reconstructing previous estimates and amplifying residuals.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-motion generation tasks.

Conclusion: RAM effectively addresses representational gaps and error propagation in motion diffusion models, achieving superior performance through motion latent space supervision and reconstructive error guidance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using Stable Diffusion with LoRA to generate synthetic images of rare Chinese porcelain artifacts to augment limited training data for CNN-based classification tasks, showing task-specific improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for archaeological artifact classification faces fundamental data scarcity challenges, especially for rare types of Chinese porcelain where real training samples are extremely limited.

Method: Generated synthetic images using Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), then trained MobileNetV3 with transfer learning on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) for four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln, and type identification.

Result: Task-specific benefits observed: type classification showed most substantial improvement (5.5% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), dynasty and kiln tasks had modest gains (3-4%), suggesting synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both potential and limitations of synthetic data when balancing archaeological authenticity with data diversity needs.

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

### [47] [UniRoute: Unified Routing Mixture-of-Experts for Modality-Adaptive Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14797)
*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Wei Lu,Zhihui You,Chengzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRoute is a unified framework for modality-adaptive remote sensing change detection that addresses limitations of specialized models through conditional routing and self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods rely on specialized models that lack scalability across different modalities. Homogeneous CD needs fine-grained spatial details while heterogeneous CD requires broader context, and difference operators work poorly for cross-modal or misaligned scenarios. Specialized models with static backbones or fixed operations are insufficient for modality-adaptive Earth observation.

Method: Proposes UniRoute with: 1) Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, 2) Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) to adaptively select fusion primitives at each pixel, and 3) Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy to stabilize training in data-scarce heterogeneous settings.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate strong overall performance with favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under unified deployment setting.

Conclusion: UniRoute provides a unified, modality-adaptive solution for remote sensing change detection that overcomes limitations of specialized models through conditional routing mechanisms and self-distillation strategies.

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

*Qihua Liang,Liang Chen,Yaozong Zheng,Jian Nong,Zhiyi Mo,Bineng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UBATrack is a novel multi-modal tracking framework using Mamba-style state space models with two key modules: Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter for cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal cues, and Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer for enhanced representation, achieving SOTA performance on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E benchmarks without full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal trackers using prompt learning overlook effective capture of spatio-temporal cues, limiting their performance despite integrating multiple complementary inputs like thermal, depth, and event data.

Method: UBATrack uses a Mamba-style state space model with two modules: 1) Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal cues via adapter-tuning, 2) Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer enhances multi-modal representation across feature dimensions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks (LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, VisEvent datasets), achieving outstanding results with improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: UBATrack effectively captures spatio-temporal cues in multi-modal tracking through Mamba's long-sequence modeling and adapter-tuning approach, eliminating costly full-parameter fine-tuning while achieving superior performance across multiple tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.

*Donnate Hooft,Stefan M. Fischer,Cosmin Bercea,Jan C. Peeken,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-based 3D medical image segmentation often ignores patch location context, limiting performance. LocBAM attention mechanism incorporates spatial information, improving segmentation especially with low patch coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based methods are necessary for 3D medical image segmentation due to memory constraints, but they typically neglect the patch's location within the global volume. This lack of spatial context can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important for accurate segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes LocBAM, a novel attention mechanism that explicitly processes spatial information to incorporate location context in patch-based 3D segmentation. This approach helps maintain awareness of where each patch is located within the global volume.

Result: Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 datasets show that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance. LocBAM particularly excels under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing, and consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv.

Conclusion: Location context is important for patch-based 3D medical image segmentation. The proposed LocBAM attention mechanism effectively incorporates spatial information, leading to better segmentation performance, especially in challenging scenarios with limited patch coverage.

Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data.

*Tobias Weißberg,Weikang Wang,Paul Roetzer,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a feature disentanglement approach for symmetry-aware shape descriptors that separates symmetry-informative and symmetry-agnostic features, with refinement for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry-aware descriptors are limited: recent methods extract only 1D symmetry-informative features, missing other semantic information, and produce noisy results with misclassified patches.

Method: Feature disentanglement approach that simultaneously learns symmetry-informative and symmetry-agnostic features, plus a feature refinement technique to improve robustness of symmetry predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness in intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing symmetry-aware descriptors by providing robust, disentangled features that capture both symmetry information and other semantic content.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTR is a post-training compression codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that reduces storage requirements while maintaining quality and accelerating inference through novel pruning and lighting coefficient optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) outperforms NeRF in speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. The paper aims to address this storage bottleneck through efficient compression without sacrificing the speed advantages of 3DGS.

Method: POTR introduces two novel techniques: 1) A pruning approach using a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's removal effect simultaneously, resulting in 2-4x fewer splats. 2) A method to recompute lighting coefficients to reduce entropy without training, increasing AC lighting coefficient sparsity from 70% to 97%. The system also includes an optional fine-tuning scheme to further enhance performance.

Result: POTR achieves 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques, accelerates inference by 1.5-2x faster than other compressed models, and increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity from 70% to 97% with minimal quality loss. Without fine-tuning, it consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: POTR successfully addresses the storage limitations of 3DGS while maintaining its speed advantages, providing an effective post-training compression solution that improves both storage efficiency and inference performance without requiring extensive retraining.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment. While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings.

A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371. Results demonstrate that integrating photo images with metadata in a structured, multi-stage pipeline yields significant performance improvements.

It combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings to capture uncertainty resolution dynamics along filament boundaries, enabling interpretable trajectory-based refinement.

Result: MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models on synthetic and real microtubule datasets. It also demonstrates strong generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures like retinal blood vessels and nerves, offering time-efficient analysis with more precise annotations than manual approaches.

Conclusion: MTFlow provides a powerful, interpretable, and time-efficient tool for microtubule and filamentous structure segmentation, addressing key challenges in biomedical image analysis with its novel flow-matching approach that enables trajectory-based refinement.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAT-NeRF: A hybrid neural radiance field framework using Geometry-Aware-Transformer to enhance high-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video, achieving state-of-the-art performance in capturing fine details like wrinkles and textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's increasing demand for immersive virtual human applications, but current NeRF-based methods struggle to capture high-frequency facial details (dynamic wrinkles, subtle textures) from information-constrained monocular video streams, requiring significant enhancement.

Method: Proposes GAT-NeRF, a hybrid framework integrating Transformer mechanism into NeRF pipeline. Combines coordinate-aligned MLP with lightweight Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) module that processes multi-modal inputs (3D spatial coordinates, 3DMM expression parameters, learnable latent codes) with explicit geometric priors to enhance feature representations for fine-grained geometry.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, significantly improving modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

Conclusion: GAT-NeRF forges new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications by effectively addressing the challenge of high-fidelity 4D facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified representation that enables embodied spatial intelligence by combining 3D geometry, semantics, and language from casually captured video, allowing interpretable reasoning over spatial relations without specialized sensors.

Method: Reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments from egocentric RGB video, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as scaffold, populates hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and textual descriptions to 3D coordinates for compact storage and fast retrieval.

Result: Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes show strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion.

Conclusion: SpatialMem offers an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence that supports downstream tasks like language-guided navigation and object retrieval using only RGB video.

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: EroSeg-AT: Vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework using EroSeg to generate adversarial examples by selecting sensitive pixels and propagating perturbations to disrupt semantic consistency, improving segmentation model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and current adversarial training methods are limited because they only consider global semantic information while ignoring contextual semantic relationships within samples, reducing their effectiveness.

Method: Propose EroSeg-AT framework that uses EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence, then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels to disrupt semantic consistency of samples.

Result: Experimental results show the approach significantly improves attack effectiveness compared to existing methods and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

Conclusion: EroSeg-AT effectively addresses limitations of existing adversarial training methods by considering contextual semantic relationships, leading to better attack effectiveness and improved model robustness for segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

### [57] [TempViz: On the Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14951)
*Carolin Holtermann,Nina Krebs,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempViz is the first dataset to evaluate temporal knowledge in text-to-image models, revealing poor performance across models and highlighting the need for better evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time significantly affects visual appearance of entities, but research on temporal knowledge in text-to-image models is scarce despite its importance for generating contextually-relevant images.

Method: Created TempViz dataset with 7.9k prompts and 600+ reference images across 5 temporal knowledge categories, evaluated 5 T2I models using human evaluation and compared automated evaluation methods against human judgments.

Result: Temporal competence in T2I models is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Automated evaluation methods fail to reliably assess temporal cues.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I models, as current models struggle with temporal reasoning and existing evaluation methods are inadequate.

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDF-VFI introduces a video-centric diffusion transformer framework for frame interpolation that ensures long-range temporal coherence through auto-regressive modeling, skip-concatenate sampling, and efficient processing of arbitrary resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFI methods use frame-centric approaches that process videos as independent short segments, causing temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. The paper aims to overcome these limitations with a holistic, video-centric paradigm.

Method: Proposes LDF-VFI built on an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models entire video sequences. Introduces skip-concatenate sampling to mitigate error accumulation, sparse local attention and tiled VAE encoding for efficiency and resolution generalization, and an enhanced conditional VAE decoder with multi-scale features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

Conclusion: LDF-VFI presents an effective video-centric approach to frame interpolation that ensures long-range temporal coherence while enabling efficient processing of arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining.

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

*Nilanjana Chatterjee,Sidharatha Garg,A V Subramanyam,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-TBPS proposes a unified model for text-based person search that outperforms dataset-specific models through noise-aware dataset curation and scalable identity learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TBPS methods require separate fine-tuning for each dataset due to limited training data and VLMs not being pre-trained for pedestrian recognition. Synthetic data helps scale but doesn't solve dataset-specific adaptation. The paper aims to create a single unified model that works across multiple datasets.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) Noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets, and 2) Scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective with large numbers of unique identities.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 show that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms both dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Scale-TBPS successfully addresses the limitations of current TBPS methods by enabling a single unified model to work across multiple datasets through improved dataset curation and scalable learning techniques.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiViBench is the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, featuring 24 diverse tasks. The paper introduces a semi-automatic annotation workflow using multi-agent MLLMs, develops LiVi-LLM-7B with specialized instruction-tuning and VCR module, achieving superior performance over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation benchmarks focus on non-interactive videos (movies, recordings), creating a gap for interactive livestream understanding. Interactive livestreams present unique challenges with multiple modalities (audio, speech, real-time comments) that require specialized evaluation.

Method: 1) Created LiViBench with 24 diverse tasks for interactive livestreams; 2) Designed standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow with human-in-the-loop using multi-agent MLLMs for video description and seed-question-driven annotation; 3) Developed LiVi-LLM-7B with two-stage instruction-tuning and Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to enhance real-time comment utilization.

Result: LiVi-LLM-7B outperforms larger open-source models (up to 72B parameters), narrows gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks (VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoEval-Pro).

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in interactive livestream video evaluation through LiViBench benchmark and LiVi-LLM-7B model. The proposed methods demonstrate effectiveness in enhancing multimodal understanding of interactive content while maintaining strong performance on general video tasks.

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset, and proposes a visual-guided spatial audio generation framework that produces immersive binaural audio from video while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-audio generation models focus mainly on semantic and temporal alignment but neglect spatial perception and immersive quality, largely due to reliance on mono audio datasets that lack binaural spatial information needed for visual-to-spatial audio mappings.

Method: Two key contributions: 1) Construction of BinauralVGGSound dataset (first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset), and 2) An end-to-end spatial audio generation framework with visual-guided audio spatialization module that explicitly models spatial features while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: The approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers more immersive auditory experience without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the spatial perception gap in video-to-audio generation through a novel dataset and framework, achieving superior spatial audio quality while maintaining alignment, with all resources to be publicly released for future research.

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: Federated learning framework enables brain tumor localization across institutions without sharing patient data, matching centralized performance while providing explainable attention patterns aligned with clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor analysis requires large datasets but privacy regulations silo data across institutions, preventing collaborative model development while maintaining data privacy.

Method: Federated learning framework using hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture deployed within CAFEIN platform, with explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms.

Result: Federated learning enables continued model improvement beyond isolated training, matching centralized performance; deeper layers show increased attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.50).

Conclusion: Federated learning is justified for complex medical tasks as it aggregates knowledge across institutions while preserving privacy, with explainable attention patterns that align with clinical expertise.

Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

TL;DR: A new federated learning attack uses generative Flow Matching to reconstruct private client data from model updates with higher fidelity than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to deep leakage attacks that can reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. Existing methods have limitations in stability, fidelity, and robustness under realistic FL settings.

Method: Integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process, guiding optimization toward realistic image distributions using a flow matching foundation model without requiring knowledge of the private data.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses like noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for new defense strategies that account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors, as current defenses are insufficient against this enhanced attack method.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data masking techniques like anonymization fail to balance privacy protection and data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing methods suffer from repeated trade-off processes between privacy and utility.

Method: Uses Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent (EFSGD) method with reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism during training to generate differentially private synthetic data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA benchmarks under same privacy budget, generating higher quality and more usable images than related work.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances privacy and utility, demonstrating strong generalization across both grayscale and RGB image datasets while achieving superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play framework that improves CLIP-based foreground-background decomposition for few-shot OOD detection by adaptively suppressing background patches and rectifying confusable foreground patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods have limitations: uniform background suppression ignores varying patch contributions, and foreground regions may contain patches similar to other classes that mislead training.

Method: Three components: 1) FG-BG Decomposition module to separate images, 2) Adaptive Background Suppression module that weights patch classification entropy adaptively, 3) Confusable Foreground Rectification module to identify and correct misleading foreground patches.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly improves performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods for few-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed plug-and-play framework effectively addresses limitations of current FG-BG methods by adaptive background suppression and confusable foreground rectification, enhancing few-shot OOD detection performance.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictorialCortex enables zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction by modeling fMRI activity with compositional latent formulation and using multi-dataset training on standardized cortical-surface data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual experience reconstruction from fMRI faces challenges due to cortical response variability across individuals and trials, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. The paper addresses the practical problem of zero-shot cross-subject reconstruction where unseen individuals' visual experiences must be reconstructed without subject-specific training.

Method: Proposes PictorialCortex with compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. Uses latent factorization-composition module with consistency regularization. Creates UniCortex-fMRI dataset from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets with standardized processing. During inference, aggregates surrogate latents from multiple seen subjects to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

Result: Extensive experiments show PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, demonstrating benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles the challenging zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction problem through compositional latent modeling and standardized multi-dataset training, advancing visual experience decoding from brain activity.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pb4U-GNet introduces a resolution-adaptive graph neural network for garment simulation that decouples message propagation from feature updates, enabling strong cross-resolution generalization even when trained only on low-resolution meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based garment simulation is computationally expensive, and existing GNN approaches suffer from poor cross-resolution generalization, with significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond training distribution due to fixed message-passing depth and resolution-dependent displacement magnitudes.

Method: Proposes Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet) with two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control that adjusts message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling that scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalizability across diverse mesh resolutions even when trained solely on low-resolution meshes, addressing the fundamental challenge of cross-resolution generalization in neural garment simulation.

Conclusion: Pb4U-GNet provides a resolution-adaptive framework that successfully decouples message propagation from feature updates, enabling robust neural garment simulation with strong cross-resolution generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

*Shuonan Yang,Yuchen Zhang,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS is a training-free multi-stage adversarial reasoning framework for hateful video detection that uses objective description, evidence-based reasoning, counter-evidence reasoning, and synthesis to produce reliable and interpretable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hateful video detection methods have limitations: training-based approaches suffer from limited training data and lack interpretability, while direct prompting of large vision-language models often fails to provide reliable hate detection. Hateful videos pose serious risks including discrimination amplification, violence incitement, and online safety threats.

Method: MARS is a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework with four stages: 1) objective description of video content to establish neutral foundation, 2) evidence-based reasoning supporting potential hateful interpretations, 3) counter-evidence reasoning capturing plausible non-hateful perspectives, and 4) synthesis of these perspectives into conclusive and explainable decisions.

Result: Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches, and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. The framework also produces human-understandable justifications.

Conclusion: MARS provides a reliable and interpretable solution for hateful video detection that addresses limitations of existing methods, supports compliance oversight, and enhances transparency in content moderation workflows through its adversarial reasoning approach and explainable decisions.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates robustness of promptable segmentation models (like SAM) to natural variations in bounding box prompts, introduces BREPS for generating adversarial bounding boxes, and benchmarks models across 10 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training/evaluation protocols use synthetic prompts with simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. Bounding boxes are particularly effective prompts but models may be sensitive to natural variations in how users draw them.

Method: 1) Conducted controlled user study to collect real bounding box annotations; 2) Reformulated robustness evaluation as white-box optimization over bounding box prompt space; 3) Introduced BREPS method to generate adversarial bounding boxes that minimize/maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints.

Result: Analysis revealed substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for same model/instance, indicating SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Benchmarking across 10 datasets (everyday scenes to medical imaging) showed robustness issues.

Conclusion: Promptable segmentation models are vulnerable to natural variations in bounding box prompts, highlighting need for robustness evaluation beyond synthetic prompts. BREPS provides systematic way to assess and potentially improve model robustness to real-world user input variations.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

TL;DR: GraSP is a unified framework for visual graph recognition that works across diverse graph types and drawings without task-specific modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual graph recognition remains challenging due to lack of canonical approaches; existing solutions are problem-specific and not transferable between contexts despite solving the same conceptual problem.

Method: Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction (GraSP) - a method designed for broad applicability and simplicity that recognizes graphs in images.

Result: Works across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application with diverse graph types and drawings; can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications.

Conclusion: GraSP paves the way for a more unified framework for visual graph recognition, addressing the transferability limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated except for crowded scenes, which remain challenging. The authors aim to improve pose estimation specifically in crowded scenarios without compromising performance on standard scenes.

Method: Introduces PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator with probabilistic formulation and mask-conditioning.

Conclusion: The proposed PMPose and BMPv2 effectively address crowded scene pose estimation challenges, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks. Advances in 2D pose quality directly translate to better 3D pose estimation, especially in crowded scenarios.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of CNN, Transformer, and hybrid models for Alzheimer's disease classification from MRI scans shows hybrid ensemble (Evan_V2) achieves near-perfect 99.99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate Alzheimer's disease classification from brain MRI is crucial for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes, necessitating robust diagnostic tools.

Method: Comparative analysis of 5 CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), 5 Transformer models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model Evan_V2 that integrates outputs from all 10 architectures through feature-level fusion for four-class AD classification.

Result: CNNs performed strongly (ResNet50: 98.83% accuracy), Transformers showed competitive generalization (ViT: 95.38% accuracy) but with class-specific instability. Evan_V2 hybrid achieved best performance: 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, 0.9968 ROC AUC, with substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages.

Conclusion: Hybrid ensemble strategies combining CNN and Transformer architectures show superior performance for Alzheimer's disease classification, offering highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenDi integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models for urban scene generation, using 3D Gaussians for coarse structure and 2D video diffusion for appearance details while maintaining camera controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D diffusion models for urban scene generation suffer from degraded appearance details, while 2D-only methods compromise camera controllability. There's a need to combine both approaches for realistic and controllable urban scene synthesis.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians for coarse scene structure at low resolution, optionally conditioned on bounding boxes, road maps, or text. 2) Train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details using rendered images from the 3D Gaussians as guidance.

Result: Experiments on Waymo and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate effective urban scene generation that maintains both realistic appearance details and accurate camera trajectory adherence.

Conclusion: ScenDi successfully integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models to overcome limitations of single-modality approaches, achieving realistic urban scene generation with controllable camera trajectories and detailed appearance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with task progress estimation despite excelling at visual description. Progress-Bench benchmark reveals models are sensitive to demonstration modality/viewpoint and handle unanswerable cases poorly. Training-based ProgressLM-3B shows consistent improvements even when trained on disjoint tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs are good at describing visible content, it's unclear if they can infer task progress from partial observations. Progress estimation requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than static visual recognition.

Method: Introduced Progress-Bench benchmark for evaluating progress reasoning. Explored two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach using curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Tested 14 VLMs.

Result: Most VLMs are not ready for task progress estimation - sensitive to demonstration modality/viewpoint changes, poor handling of unanswerable cases. Training-free prompting yields limited gains, but training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even with disjoint training/evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: Progress reasoning remains challenging for current VLMs. Training-based approaches show promise, but models need better handling of dynamic reasoning, viewpoint changes, and uncertainty. The benchmark reveals characteristic error patterns in progress estimation.

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical spine fractures require precise detection for clinical management. Traditional 3D segmentation methods are computationally complex, so the study explores 2D projection-based approaches as a more efficient alternative while maintaining performance.

Method: End-to-end pipeline: 1) Approximate 3D volume via optimized 2D axial/sagittal/coronal projections, 2) YOLOv8 for ROI localization (94.45% 3D mIoU), 3) DenseNet121-Unet multi-label segmentation using variance/energy-based projections (87.86% Dice), 4) Extract individual vertebra volumes, 5) Ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models using raw slices and projections for fracture detection.

Result: Vertebra-level F1: 68.15%, patient-level F1: 82.26%; ROC-AUC: 91.62% (vertebra) and 83.04% (patient). Explainability study provides saliency maps, interobserver analysis shows competitive performance compared to expert radiologists.

Conclusion: 2D projection-based approach effectively reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance for cervical spine fracture detection, validated through explainability and interobserver analysis demonstrating clinical viability.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

Conclusion: DrivIng addresses the gap in existing datasets by providing both real-world data and a digital twin, supporting reproducible research, robust validation, and flexible testing capabilities for autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing.

*Yu Wu,Minsik Jeon,Jen-Hao Rick Chang,Oncel Tuzel,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayRoPE: A novel positional encoding for multi-view transformers that uses ray-based encoding with predicted 3D points and SE(3)-invariant attention, achieving better performance on novel-view synthesis and depth estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for positional encodings in multi-view transformers that uniquely encode patches, allow SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and adapt to scene geometry - requirements not met by prior absolute or relative encoding schemes.

Method: RayRoPE represents patch positions using associated rays but leverages predicted 3D points along rays instead of directions for geometry-aware encoding. Uses query-frame projective coordinates for SE(3) invariance and analytically computes expected position encoding under prediction uncertainty.

Result: Consistent improvements over alternate position encoding schemes (15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). Can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input for even larger gains over alternatives that cannot encode this information.

Conclusion: RayRoPE addresses limitations of prior multi-view positional encodings by providing a geometry-aware, SE(3)-invariant encoding that handles uncertainty and improves performance on vision tasks like novel-view synthesis and depth estimation.

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

TL;DR: StableWorld introduces a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism to address instability and temporal inconsistency in interactive video generation by filtering degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive video generation methods suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions, despite progress in world modeling.

Method: Proposes StableWorld with a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism that continuously filters out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones to prevent cumulative error propagation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple interactive video models (Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, Hunyuan-GameCraft), showing substantial improvements in stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: StableWorld is a simple yet effective, model-agnostic solution that addresses the core instability problem in interactive video generation by preventing error accumulation at its source.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: Interactive light editing for indoor scenes from multi-view capture using generative light decomposition and 3D Gaussian splatting for real-time control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling interactive editing of individual light sources in indoor scenes from single multi-view captures, allowing users to control lighting states, colors, and intensities independently.

Method: Uses generative image-based light decomposition to factorize complex indoor illumination into constituent light sources, with multi-view lighting harmonization for consistency across views, integrated into relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation.

Result: Achieves photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting across diverse indoor scenes, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets with quantitative and qualitative comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time interactive control over individual light sources in indoor scenes from multi-view captures, demonstrating high-quality photorealistic results and outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: EgoWM transforms pretrained video diffusion models into action-conditioned world models for accurate future prediction across various embodiments, achieving better physical correctness and faster inference than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create video generation models that can accurately predict correct futures based on actions, not just plausible ones, by leveraging existing video models rather than training from scratch.

Method: Repurpose pretrained video diffusion models by injecting motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers, transforming them into action-conditioned world models that scale across different embodiments (3-DoF to 25-DoF).

Result: EgoWM improves Structural Consistency Score by up to 80% over prior navigation world models, achieves 6x lower inference latency, robust generalization to unseen environments (including paintings), and produces coherent rollouts for navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully transforms existing video models into accurate world models with strong generalization, demonstrating that rich world priors from Internet-scale video data can be effectively repurposed for action-conditioned future prediction.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

TL;DR: The paper investigates quantization methods for multimodal pipelines (vision models, language models, connectors) to reduce memory and latency while preserving performance on tasks like captioning, retrieval, and QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require fast GPUs with large memory, creating deployment challenges. While quantization reduces memory/latency, most research focuses on single-modality models, leaving multimodal pipelines under-explored.

Method: Applied various quantization methods (including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ) to multimodal pipelines, testing different bit widths and quantization strategies across vision models, language models, and their connectors.

Result: ViT and LLM show comparable importance despite parameter size differences. Lower-bit quantization of LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight. Performance varies by task, bit width, quantization method, and which pipeline component is quantized.

Conclusion: Provides practical insights for efficient MLLM deployment and highlights the value of exploring component sensitivities in multimodal models. Code is available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

*Jiwon Kang,Yeji Choi,JoungBin Lee,Wooseok Jang,Jinhyeok Choi,Taekeun Kang,Yongjae Park,Myungin Kim,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APPLE is a diffusion-based teacher-student framework for face swapping that uses attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision to better preserve target attributes like lighting, skin tone, and makeup while transferring source identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping faces challenges due to lack of real ground truth data, making it difficult to achieve both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation. Existing diffusion-based methods using masked conditional inpainting remove crucial appearance cues, resulting in plausible but misaligned attributes.

Method: APPLE uses a teacher-student framework with attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. It reformulates face swapping as a conditional deblurring task and introduces an attribute-aware inversion scheme. The teacher produces high-quality pseudo triplets that provide direct supervision to the student for attribute preservation.

Result: APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful face swapping results compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed APPLE framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing face swapping methods by using attribute-preserving pseudo-label supervision, leading to superior attribute fidelity and identity transfer in face swapping tasks.

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Optimal additive ε-DP mechanisms for vector queries are staircase distributions for any dimension, norm, and norm-monotone cost function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal noise distribution for additive differential privacy mechanisms that minimizes expected utility loss while satisfying ε-DP constraints.

Method: Using convex rearrangement theory to reduce infinite-dimensional optimization to a one-dimensional compact convex family of radially symmetric distributions, showing extreme points are staircase distributions.

Result: Proves existence of optimal ε-DP staircase mechanisms for any dimension, norm, and norm-monotone cost function, resolving a conjecture by Geng et al.

Conclusion: Staircase mechanisms are optimal among all additive mechanisms for differential privacy, providing geometric explanation for their extremal properties.

Abstract: We study the optimal design of additive mechanisms for vector-valued queries under $ε$-differential privacy (DP). Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $ε$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $ε$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.

*Keigo Takeuchi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper establishes fundamental limits for signal estimation with sublinear sparsity in AWGN channels, showing ML estimator achieves vanishing error below a noise threshold, while all estimators fail above another threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand fundamental limits of signal estimation with sublinear sparsity, which is crucial for designing effective denoisers in message-passing algorithms (like approximate message-passing) for sparse signal recovery problems.

Method: The authors use information-theoretic analysis to prove direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit. They analyze the maximum likelihood estimator for the direct theorem and establish fundamental limits for all estimators in the converse theorem.

Result: Main results: (1) ML estimator achieves vanishing square error when noise variance is below a threshold; (2) All estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than signal power when noise variance is above another threshold; (3) The two thresholds coincide for constant amplitude signals, establishing asymptotic optimality of existing separable Bayesian estimators used in AMP.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental information-theoretic limits for sublinear sparsity estimation, proving asymptotic optimality of existing separable Bayesian estimators used in approximate message-passing algorithms for sparse signal recovery.

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of signals with sublinear sparsity sent over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applications in manufacturing, wireless communication, and molecular data storage require coding schemes robust to physical distortions where codewords may be arbitrarily fragmented and partially missing.

Method: Propose $(t,s)$-break-resilient codes with formal adversarial channel model, develop theoretical foundation including lower bounds on necessary redundancy, and provide explicit code constructions.

Result: The codes guarantee correct decoding after up to t arbitrary breaks and complete loss of fragments with total length ≤ s, unifying break-resilient and deletion codes into single framework.

Conclusion: $(t,s)$-BRCs provide a comprehensive solution for applications requiring robustness to both fragmentation and partial loss, with theoretical bounds and practical constructions.

Abstract: Emerging applications in manufacturing, wireless communication, and molecular data storage require robust coding schemes that remain effective under physical distortions where codewords may be arbitrarily fragmented and partially missing. To address such challenges, we propose a new family of error-correcting codes, termed $(t,s)$-break-resilient codes ($(t,s)$-BRCs). A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework. We develop a theoretical foundation for $(t,s)$-BRCs, including a formal adversarial channel model, lower bounds on the necessary redundancy, and explicit code constructions that approach these bounds.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using movable antennas to improve physical layer security in MIMO systems with imperfect eavesdropper channel knowledge, developing an optimization framework for joint precoding and antenna positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance physical layer security in MIMOME systems by leveraging movable antennas, addressing the practical challenge of imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (only knowing LoS component and NLoS statistics).

Method: The method uses random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent for ergodic secrecy rate, then develops an alternating optimization framework: MM algorithm for precoding matrix optimization and novel AMSGrad-based surrogate for antenna position optimization.

Result: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical proof guaranteeing algorithm convergence despite relaxing strict majorization conditions, enabling efficient joint optimization of transmit precoding and antenna positions.

Conclusion: Movable antennas offer significant potential for enhancing physical layer security in practical MIMOME systems with imperfect channel knowledge, and the proposed optimization framework provides an effective solution for joint precoding and antenna positioning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antennas (MAs) to enhance physical layer security within a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) system. We consider a practical scenario where the transmitter operates with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), knowing only the instantaneous line-of-sight (LoS) component and the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component. To rigorously quantify secrecy performance under the ECSI uncertainty, we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as the metric. Since deriving an exact analytical expression for the ESR is intractable, we leverage random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent. This avoids heavy Monte Carlo simulations and also provides explicit insights into the effects of channel spatial statistics on secrecy performance. Building upon the deterministic equivalent, we formulate a joint maximization problem for the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna positions at the legitimate transmitter. To tackle the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we develop a comprehensive alternating optimization framework. Specifically, the precoding matrix is optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where the gradient is computed by solving an implicit fixed-point equation. For the antenna position optimization, the complexity of the objective function prevents the construction of standard MM surrogate. To this end, we further propose a novel AMSGrad-based surrogate function that relies solely on gradient information. We provide a rigorous theoretical proof that guarantees the convergence of this proposed algorithm despite relaxing the strict majorization conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for SIM-aided MISO downlink systems that works with statistical CSI and discrete phase shifts, offering significant complexity reduction while maintaining good performance, making it suitable for real-world low-cost hardware implementations.

Abstract: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) have emerged as a revolutionary architecture for next-generation wireless communications, offering wave-domain signal processing capabilities with significantly reduced hardware complexity compared to conventional systems. However, most existing SIM research assumes continuous phase shifts and perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which are impractical due to hardware discrete phase shift constraints and prohibitive pilot overhead. This paper presents a joint power allocation and discrete phase shift optimization framework for SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output(MISO) downlink systems under statistical CSI. We formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem considering practical discrete phase constraints and derive a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate under statistical CSI. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we decouple the problem by using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and alternating optimization (AO). Subsequently, we utilize the Lagrangian multiplier method and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain closed-form iterative solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of 50 compared to semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods, , while maintaining over 85% of the continuous phase shift performance with only 1-bit quantization, highlighting its feasibility for low-cost hardware systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "information mechanics" (infomechanics), a first-principles framework showing that Bayesian updating inherently balances posterior surprisal reduction with information gain from data, independent of algorithms or implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fundamental constraints governing uncertainty reduction in inference and learning, moving beyond optimization-based approaches to reveal invariant informational principles underlying Bayesian updating.

Method: Develops a first-principles framework based on Bayesian updating, imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness constraints to derive conservation relations. Formalizes information potential Φ as a non-additive state function that captures local geometric structure beyond Shannon entropy.

Result: Derives two independent conservation relations: one governing global uncertainty redistribution (Shannon entropy) and another capturing local geometric structure (Fisher information). Information potential Φ quantifies local sharpness/ruggedness in posterior beliefs and links information geometry to computational complexity.

Conclusion: The framework provides algorithm-independent foundations for inference, learning, and computation by separating invariant informational constraints from implementation mechanisms, formalizing an information-computation exchange where information acquisition reshapes inference landscapes and reduces computational demands.

Abstract: Inference and learning are commonly cast in terms of optimisation, yet the fundamental constraints governing uncertainty reduction remain unclear. This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $Φ$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $Φ$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $Φ$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.

TL;DR: OTFS modulation is proposed as a promising 6G waveform alternative to OFDM, offering resilience to Doppler shifts and spectral efficiency improvements while enabling joint communication and sensing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OFDM-based systems have fundamental limitations for 6G requirements: severe inter-carrier interference from high Doppler shifts causing data rate error floors, and spectral inefficiency from repetitive cyclic prefixes. These drawbacks hinder achieving 6G's ambitious KPIs.

Method: OTFS modulation operates in the delay-Doppler domain, making it inherently resilient to channel distortions from delay and Doppler effects while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. The article investigates practical implementation of OTFS leveraging existing OFDM-based infrastructure.

Result: OTFS addresses OFDM's limitations by being resilient to Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference and eliminating the need for repetitive cyclic prefixes, improving spectral efficiency. Its unique DD domain characteristics enable it to embrace dynamic channel conditions rather than combat them.

Conclusion: OTFS modulation is a promising waveform candidate for 6G that can overcome OFDM's fundamental limitations, offering resilience to Doppler effects, improved spectral efficiency, and enabling joint communication and sensing capabilities within existing wireless systems.

Abstract: The standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) has recently commenced to address the rapidly growing demands for enhanced wireless network services. Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems.

Result: Numerical results show noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in high channel mobility conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-domain channel estimation algorithm effectively addresses high mobility challenges in OFDM systems by leveraging DD domain characteristics and sparse recovery techniques, offering superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, leveraging the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Specifically, the proposed algorithm transforms the time-frequency (TF) domain pilot sequence of OFDM into the DD domain and applies a two-dimensional (2D) twisted-convolution for acquiring a coarse estimation of the underlying channel delay and Doppler. Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence. Our numerical results demonstrate noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in the presence of high channel mobility.

TL;DR: INR-based wireless imaging for RIS-aided ISAC systems achieves resolution-agnostic imaging with strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless imaging is crucial for next-gen ISAC systems but faces challenges with multipath separation and dataset acquisition. Conventional approaches (physical models or data-driven learning) struggle with these issues.

Method: Uses implicit neural representation (INR) with positional encoding and sine activation functions. Optimizes INR through deep learning with physics-informed loss functions to represent continuous target shapes and scattering profiles.

Result: Extensive simulations show significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and reveal focal length characteristics of the imaging system.

Conclusion: INR-based approach enables resolution-agnostic wireless imaging with strong generalization capability for RIS-aided ISAC systems.

Abstract: Wireless imaging is emerging as a key capability in next-generation integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, supporting diverse context-aware applications. However, conventional imaging approaches, whether based on physical models or data-driven learning, face challenges such as accurate multipath separation and representative dataset acquisition. To address these issues, this study explores the use of implicit neural representation (INR), a paradigm that has achieved notable advancements in computer vision, for wireless imaging in reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided ISAC systems. The neural network of INR is specifically designed with positional encoding and sine activation functions. Leveraging physics-informed loss functions, INR is optimized through deep learning to represent continuous target shapes and scattering profiles, enabling resolution-agnostic imaging with strong generalization capability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed INR-based method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and further reveals the focal length characteristics of the imaging system.

TL;DR: OTFS modulation outperforms OFDM for airplane/HAP-aided next-gen networks in high-mobility scenarios, achieving lower BER and more stable performance across varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed airliner/HAP mobility challenges seamless connectivity and reliable data transmission in next-generation networks, requiring robust modulation schemes to handle Doppler effects.

Method: Proposes OTFS-based airplane-aided networking system with planar antenna arrays using null steering beamforming (NSB) at transmitters for terrestrial communication, with comprehensive comparison between OTFS and OFDM under varying conditions.

Result: OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM with lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.

Conclusion: OTFS modulation is superior to OFDM for high-mobility airplane/HAP-aided next-generation networks, providing better Doppler resilience and reliable communication performance.

Abstract: Next-generation networks explore the opportunistic assistance of airliner/high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in delivering high data rates for terrestrial networks to ensure consistent and reliable communication. When an airliner/HAP moves at very high speeds, its mobility has a substantial impact on ensuring seamless connectivity, stable signal strength, and reliable data transmission. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide notable improvement in performance when handling Doppler effects during high-mobility situations. This paper presents an OTFS-based airplane-aided next-generation networking system. In the proposed system, the airliner/HAPs are equipped with a planar antenna array that applies null steering beamforming (NSB) at the transmitter for communication with terrestrial users. A comprehensive performance comparison between OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed under varying airliner altitude, velocity, array dimension, and Rician factor conditions. The simulation results show that OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.

### [97] [The Ontological Neutrality Theorem: Why Neutral Ontological Substrates Must Be Pre-Causal and Pre-Normative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14271)
*Denise M. Case*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Impossibility of neutral ontologies: Any ontology including causal or normative commitments cannot serve as neutral substrate across conflicting frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data systems need to support accountability across persistent disagreement, requiring shared ontological substrates that remain stable across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing an impossibility result through logical reasoning about ontological neutrality constraints.

Result: Proves ontological neutrality (interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions) is incompatible with including causal or normative commitments at foundational layer.

Conclusion: Neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing only entities with identity/persistence conditions while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation.

Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

*Michele Loi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for an "epistemic constitution" for AI - explicit meta-norms regulating how AI systems form and express beliefs, using source attribution bias as a case study to show current models enforce identity-stance coherence but suppress this when detected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models function as artificial reasoners but their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. The paper aims to make these policies explicit and contestable through an epistemic constitution.

Method: Analyzes source attribution bias as a case study, showing frontier models penalize arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress.

Result: Identifies two constitutional approaches: Platonic (mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from privileged standpoint) and Liberal (refuses such privilege, specifies procedural norms protecting collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending).

Conclusion: Argues for the Liberal approach, sketches a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and proposes that AI epistemic governance requires explicit, contestable structure similar to what's expected for AI ethics.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

### [99] [VisTIRA: Closing the Image-Text Modality Gap in Visual Math Reasoning via Structured Tool Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14440)
*Saeed Khaki,Ashudeep Singh,Nima Safaei,Kamal Ginotra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual math problems vs text versions (modality gap). VisTIRA framework uses tool-integrated reasoning with Python execution to solve image-based math problems. Created synthetic training data from text math corpora and real homework images to improve VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform significantly worse on mathematical reasoning when problems are presented as images rather than text, creating a "modality gap" where visual representations of the same math problems yield much lower accuracy than their text counterparts.

Method: 1) Introduced VisTIRA - a tool-integrated reasoning framework that decomposes image-based math problems into natural language rationales and executable Python steps. 2) Created a LaTeX-based pipeline to convert text-based math reasoning datasets into challenging image counterparts. 3) Built synthetic tool-use trajectories from real-world homework-style image dataset (SnapAsk) for VLM fine-tuning.

Result: Tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding helps smaller models but benefits diminish at scale. Modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size. Structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The modality gap in visual math reasoning can be addressed through structured tool-integrated reasoning frameworks like VisTIRA and targeted training data generation. Combining reasoning decomposition with OCR grounding provides effective strategies, though larger models naturally reduce the gap.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

*Valerio Belcamino,Nicholas Attolino,Alessio Capitanelli,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve high in-domain planning performance but fail completely on unseen domains, revealing reliance on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether fine-tuned LLMs develop genuine planning competence or merely memorize domain-specific patterns, and to understand their cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Method: Fine-tuned a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, then evaluated in-domain and cross-domain generalization. Introduced three diagnostic interventions: symbol anonymization, compact plan serialization, and verifier-reward fine-tuning using VAL validator as reinforcement signal.

Result: Model achieved 82.9% valid plan rate in-domain but 0% on two unseen domains. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization caused significant performance drops despite preserving semantics. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reached saturation faster but didn't improve cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs rely heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence, highlighting a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning. The diagnostic tools provide methods for studying this limitation.

Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

### [101] [Scalable Knee-Point Guided Activity Group Selection in Multi-Tree Genetic Programming for Dynamic Multi-Mode Project Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14485)
*Yuan Tian,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GP evolves priority rules for dynamic multi-mode RCPSP, enhanced with knee-point group selection for scalability on large instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group selection strategies for activity-mode pairs in RCPSP suffer from scalability issues on larger problem instances despite being effective on small-scale problems.

Method: Multi-tree GP framework evolves two types of rules: 1) activity ordering rule to rank eligible pairs, 2) knee-point selection to identify promising subset, then 3) group selection rule chooses best combination.

Result: The approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

Conclusion: Knee-point-based selection mechanism effectively enhances scalability of group selection strategy for dynamic multi-mode RCPSP.

Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

*Tony Chen,Sam Cheyette,Kelsey Allen,Joshua Tenenbaum,Kevin Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People use simplified mental representations for simulation-based reasoning by dynamically constructing these representations "just-in-time" through interleaved simulation, visual search, and representation modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mental simulation in complex environments exceeds capacity limits, requiring simplified representations. The key question is how people efficiently determine which details to abstract away while maintaining useful predictions.

Method: Proposed "Just-in-Time" framework with tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification. Current simulation guides where to look, and visual search flags objects to encode for subsequent simulation, creating simplified representations online with minimal computation.

Result: The model makes high-utility predictions despite encoding only a small subset of objects. Strong empirical support found over alternative models in grid-world planning and physical reasoning tasks across multiple behavioral measures.

Conclusion: Provides concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation, explaining how simplified representations are dynamically built "just-in-time" rather than pre-computed.

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

TL;DR: PhyloEvolve is an LLM-agent system that treats GPU algorithm optimization as In-Context Reinforcement Learning, using phylogenetic trees to organize optimization history and enable experience reuse without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted evolutionary methods for GPU code optimization rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, wasting the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization processes.

Method: PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating algorithm modifications and performance feedback as learning signals. It uses phylogenetic trees to capture inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking and cross-lineage transfer.

Result: The system demonstrates consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms.

Conclusion: PhyloEvolve successfully reframes GPU algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning problem, enabling trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining through its phylogenetic tree representation and integrated workflow.

Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

TL;DR: MAS-Orchestra: A training-time framework that formulates multi-agent system orchestration as function-calling RL with holistic orchestration, plus MASBENCH benchmark to understand when MAS outperform single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent system (MAS) design approaches under-deliver due to methodological complexity (sequential, code-level execution limiting holistic reasoning) and efficacy uncertainty (unclear if MAS provide tangible benefits over single-agent systems).

Method: MAS-Orchestra abstracts complex sub-agents as callable functions and formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration (generating entire MAS at once). MASBENCH benchmark characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness.

Result: Analysis reveals MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and capabilities of orchestrator/sub-agents rather than being universal. MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH together enable better training and understanding of multi-agent systems, advancing the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence by providing systematic frameworks for design and evaluation.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.

*Shuhua Yang,Jiahao Zhang,Yilong Wang,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

TL;DR: AGEA is an agentic graph extraction attack that efficiently steals knowledge graphs from GraphRAG systems under limited query budgets, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows GraphRAG systems leak retrieved subgraphs, but the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of hidden graph structure under realistic query budgets remains unexplored. The paper aims to study budget-constrained black-box attacks on GraphRAG systems.

Method: AGEA framework uses novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. It operates in a black-box setting where adversaries adaptively query the system.

Result: AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. Evaluated on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems under identical query budgets.

Conclusion: Modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks even under strict query limits, demonstrating serious security risks in knowledge graph-based retrieval systems.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

### [106] [Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683)
*Aisvarya Adeseye,Jouni Isoaho,Seppo Virtanen,Mohammad Tahir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) using local LLMs for context-aware anonymization of sensitive data in qualitative research transcripts, outperforming manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual anonymization of qualitative research data is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often misses critical identifiers. Existing automated tools lack context awareness and may alter data meaning, creating privacy risks for personal, contextual, and organizational details.

Method: Developed a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) with three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. Uses four strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression based on identifier type and risk level. Evaluated using dual-method approach with manual and LLM-assisted processing on two case studies (82 face-to-face interviews and 93 AI-led interviews) using local models LLaMA and Phi.

Result: LLMs detected more sensitive data than human reviewers. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data (over 91% detection rate) with 94.8% sentiment preservation, though made slightly more errors. The framework effectively anonymizes while maintaining data integrity for qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: The SFAA framework using local LLMs provides a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware solution for qualitative data anonymization that addresses privacy compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, OECD) while preserving data meaning and sentiment for research analysis.

Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IB-GRPO: An indicator-guided alignment approach using LLMs for Learning Path Recommendation that addresses pedagogical alignment, data scarcity, and multi-objective optimization through hybrid demonstrations, ZPD scoring, and group-relative policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have rich semantic understanding for recommendation but face challenges in Learning Path Recommendation: (1) misalignment with pedagogical objectives like Zone of Proximal Development under sparse feedback, (2) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (3) complex multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length control, and trajectory diversity.

Method: Propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization): 1) Construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents to address data scarcity, 2) Warm-start LLM with supervised fine-tuning, 3) Design within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling, 4) Use I_ε+ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization.

Result: Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi datasets using KES simulator with Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: IB-GRPO effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation through indicator-guided alignment, hybrid demonstration construction, and multi-objective optimization without manual scalarization, demonstrating superior performance on educational datasets.

Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

Motivation: Current LLM-based evaluation paradigms assume agent chain-of-thought reasoning faithfully reflects internal reasoning and environment state, but this assumption may be brittle and vulnerable to manipulation.

Method: Systematically rewrote agent CoTs while keeping actions and observations fixed, testing manipulation strategies including style-based (presentation changes) and content-based (fabricating task progress signals) approaches across 800 trajectories in diverse web tasks.

Result: Manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90%; content-based manipulations are consistently more effective than style-based ones; prompting techniques and scaling compute reduce but don't eliminate susceptibility.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation has fundamental vulnerability to reasoning trace manipulation, highlighting need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence rather than trusting CoT at face value.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoDriDM is a decision-centric benchmark for evaluating vision-language models in autonomous driving, focusing on decision-making rather than just perception, with 6,650 questions across three dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving benchmarks overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes, creating a gap in evaluating VLMs for real-world driving safety.

Method: Created AutoDriDM benchmark with 6,650 questions across Object, Scene, and Decision dimensions; evaluated mainstream VLMs; conducted correlation analysis between perception and decision-making; performed explainability analyses; introduced analyzer model for automated large-scale annotation.

Result: Evaluation revealed weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance in VLMs; identified key failure modes like logical reasoning errors; demonstrated the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation.

Conclusion: AutoDriDM bridges the perception-decision evaluation gap and provides guidance for developing safer, more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

*Mingxuan Song,Yusen Huo,Bohan Zhou,Shenglin Yin,Zhen Xiao,Jieyi Long,Zhilin Zhang,Chuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DARA is a dual-phase LLM framework for AI-Generated Bidding that combines few-shot reasoning with fine-grained optimization to improve advertiser value under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods struggle with few-shot scenarios in AI-Generated Bidding where advertisers have personalized objectives but limited historical data. LLMs offer in-context learning capabilities but lack numerical precision for fine-grained optimization.

Method: Introduces GRPO-Adaptive for efficient LLM post-training to enhance reasoning and numerical precision, and DARA - a dual-phase framework with few-shot reasoner (generates initial plans via in-context prompting) and fine-grained optimizer (refines plans using feedback-driven reasoning).

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data show DARA consistently outperforms existing baselines in cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required for AIGB tasks, addressing both few-shot learning and numerical optimization challenges.

Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP's rule-based formalism makes it inherently suitable for explainable AI, but existing explanation approaches often address specific scenarios and may not cover all user needs. There's a need to systematically survey ASP explanations from an XAI perspective.

Method: Survey methodology: provides overview of ASP explanation types, connects them to user questions for explanation, describes current theory and tool coverage, and identifies gaps in existing approaches.

Result: Comprehensive analysis of ASP explanation landscape, mapping explanation types to user questions, assessing current tool coverage, and pinpointing specific gaps in existing approaches.

Conclusion: Identifies research directions for future work in ASP explanations, highlighting areas where current approaches are insufficient and suggesting improvements for better XAI support in ASP systems.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative reasoning and problem solving approach in symbolic AI. Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

*Haizhou Liu,Haodong Jin,Yiming Wang,Hui Yu*

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-guided unsupervised video summarization method using semantic alignment attention and incremental training to improve GAN-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised video summarization methods rely on GANs but have limitations: they use unimodal features, overlook semantic information's guiding role in keyframe selection, and suffer from unstable training.

Method: 1) Design a frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism integrated into a keyframe selector; 2) Use this to guide a Transformer-based generator within an adversarial framework for better video reconstruction; 3) Adopt incremental training strategy to progressively update model components and mitigate GAN instability.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-guided approach with incremental training effectively addresses limitations of existing GAN-based unsupervised video summarization methods, achieving better performance through semantic guidance and stable training.

Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

*Amaury Guichard,Laurent Michel,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First bound-consistent algorithm for NP-complete no-overlap constraint using MDD-based filtering with width threshold for polynomial-time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bound consistency for no-overlap constraint is NP-complete, so existing polynomial-time techniques (edge finding, not-first-not-last, energetic reasoning) are incomplete. Need stronger filtering that approaches bound consistency while maintaining polynomial complexity.

Method: Builds on no-overlap MDD by Ciré and van Hoeve. Extracts job time window bounds from MDD to tighten start/end times. Limits MDD width to threshold for polynomial complexity, creating relaxed MDD for bound-consistent filtering.

Result: Proposed filtering achieves stronger search tree reduction than previous precedence-detection algorithm. Complementary to classical propagation methods, reduces both nodes visited and solving time on sequencing problems with time windows and just-in-time objective.

Conclusion: First practical bound-consistent algorithm for no-overlap constraint using width-limited MDD approach, providing stronger filtering while maintaining polynomial complexity.

Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CI4A introduces semantic encapsulation of UI components into agent-accessible tool primitives, enabling LLM agents to better interact with web interfaces and achieving 86.3% task success rate on WebArena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at high-level semantic planning but struggle with fine-grained web component manipulation. Instead of forcing agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, the paper proposes creating interfaces optimized specifically for agents.

Method: CI4A (Component Interface for Agent) abstracts complex UI component interaction logic into unified tool primitives. Implemented in Ant Design covering 23 UI component categories. Developed hybrid agent with dynamically updating action space based on page state.

Result: CI4A-based agent achieves 86.3% task success rate on WebArena benchmark (refactored with CI4A-integrated Ant Design), significantly outperforming existing SoTA methods with substantial execution efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Creating agent-optimized interfaces through semantic encapsulation (CI4A) is more effective than forcing agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, enabling LLM agents to better handle web component interactions.

Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors in vision-language models for chest X-ray classification, highlighting the need for better evaluation of abstraction errors using medical taxonomies.

Method: Benchmark VLMs using hierarchical metrics, introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes, propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings.

Result: VLMs show substantial misalignment with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance; proposed methods reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2% while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: Hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment are crucial for safer, more clinically meaningful deployment of vision-language models in medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic method that compiles Description Logic ontologies into circuits for reliable, ontology-consistent predictions, faster reasoning, and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neuro-symbolic methods lack native support for ontologies, limiting their ability to ensure predictions are consistent with formal domain knowledge represented in Description Logic ontologies.

Method: Compile Description Logic ontologies into circuits (feed-forward differentiable computational graphs) that support: (i) synthetic dataset generation capturing ontology semantics, (ii) efficient GPU-based deductive reasoning, and (iii) neuro-symbolic models with provably consistent predictions.

Result: Synthetic datasets capture ontology semantics and challenge ML classifiers; circuit-based reasoning is up to 1000x faster than existing reasoners; neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions while maintaining or outperforming neural network baselines.

Conclusion: Compiling ontologies into circuits enables tighter integration between Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation, allowing a single circuit representation to tackle multiple challenging tasks relevant to real-world applications.

Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.
  Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.
  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.
  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.

*Nadine Meertens,Suet Lee,Ophelia Deroy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from AI consciousness debates to evaluating "awareness" as a more practical, measurable alternative for assessing AI systems' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debates about AI consciousness and moral status lack agreement on evaluation methods. There's a need for a more productive, methodologically tractable approach to assess AI systems' properties.

Method: Introduces a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness encompasses abilities to process, store, and use information for goal-directed action. The approach must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable performance prediction while generalizing for comparison.

Result: Proposes a structured approach to evaluate and compare awareness profiles across artificial systems with different architectures, scales, and operational domains.

Conclusion: Shifting focus from artificial consciousness to "being just aware enough" facilitates principled assessment, supports design and oversight, and enables more constructive scientific and public discourse about AI capabilities.

Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TGA is a linear-complexity graph attention network that models multi-behavior transitions in e-commerce, outperforming transformer-based methods while being computationally efficient enough for industrial deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based sequential models for multi-behavior data have high computational costs (polynomial time complexity), limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences.

Method: TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: item-level, category-level, and neighbor-level transitions. It then uses a transition-aware graph attention mechanism to jointly model user-item interactions and behavior transition types.

Result: TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. It has been successfully deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, leading to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

Conclusion: TGA provides an effective and efficient solution for modeling multi-behavior transitions in e-commerce, addressing the computational limitations of transformer-based approaches while maintaining strong performance for industrial applications.

Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for un- derstanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi- behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional trans- formers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behav- ior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while sig- nificantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

*Fabio Morreale,Joan Serrà,Yuki Mistufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current XAI approaches for assuming meaning is inherent in AI models, and proposes an alternative framework based on agential realism where interpretations emerge from situated human-AI-context entanglements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI approaches are limited by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: treating meaning as immanent to models, positioning explainers outside systems, and presuming causal structures are recoverable computationally. The paper aims to develop an alternative framework that better accounts for the situated, emergent nature of AI interpretation.

Method: The authors use Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI, reading a comprehensive set of XAI methods through this lens to reveal their assumptions and limitations. They then articulate the ethical dimensions of this framework and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

Result: The paper reveals the limitations of current XAI methods by showing how they are underpinned by problematic assumptions about meaning, agency, and causality. It develops an alternative framework where interpretations are material-discursive performances emerging from situated entanglements between AI models, humans, context, and interpretative apparatus.

Conclusion: XAI should be reconceptualized as emergent interpretation arising from situated entanglements rather than as revealing inherent model meaning. This alternative framework has important ethical implications and suggests new design directions for XAI interfaces that support more nuanced, context-aware interpretation processes.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

### [121] [The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059)
*Oleg Romanchuk,Roman Bondar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modern CI/CD pipelines with AI agents create a "responsibility vacuum" where no one has both authority to approve decisions and capacity to understand them, making personal responsibility structurally impossible at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical failure in modern software deployment where AI-generated code passes through formal approval processes, but no human has both the authority to approve decisions and the cognitive capacity to truly understand what they're approving, creating a dangerous accountability gap.

Method: The authors define "responsibility vacuum" as a structural condition, analyze scaling limits under standard deployment assumptions (parallel agent generation, CI validation, human approval gates), and characterize CI amplification dynamics where increased automation worsens the problem.

Result: The paper shows that beyond a certain throughput threshold, verification becomes ritualized approval based on proxy signals rather than meaningful understanding. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable, and additional automation amplifies rather than mitigates the responsibility vacuum.

Conclusion: Organizations must explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility from individual decisions to batch- or system-level ownership to address this invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled AI deployments.

Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

*Chen Qian,Peng Wang,Dongrui Liu,Junyao Yang,Dadi Guo,Ling Tang,Jilin Mei,Qihan Ren,Shuai Shao,Yong Liu,Jie Fu,Jing Shao,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical framework for general agentic attribution to explain LLM-based agent behaviors, identifying internal factors driving actions regardless of task outcome, validated across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based agents become more autonomous and deployed at scale, understanding why agents take particular actions is crucial for accountability and governance. Existing research focuses only on failure attribution for unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining reasoning behind agent behaviors.

Method: A hierarchical framework for general agentic attribution: 1) At component level, uses temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; 2) At sentence level, refines localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate specific textual evidence.

Result: Experimental validation across diverse agentic scenarios (standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias) demonstrates the framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind agent behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems by enabling comprehensive attribution of agent behaviors beyond just failure analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

TL;DR: RISE: A "Real-to-Virtual" method that synthesizes virtual tool-using trajectories and generates diverse negative samples to mitigate intent deviation in LLM agents, improving task completion and intent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based tool-using agents suffer from "intent deviation" - subtle misalignments between user intent and agent behavior. Existing methods are either costly (relying on real system samples) or suffer from distribution shift (using LLM-simulated data), and both lack negative samples for intent deviation scenarios.

Method: RISE anchors on verified tool primitives to synthesize virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. It then fine-tunes backbone LLMs via two-stage training for intent alignment using the synthetic data.

Result: RISE achieves 35.28% average improvement in task completion (Acctask) and 23.27% in intent alignment (Accintent), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20-42.09% and 1.17-54.93% respectively across eight evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: RISE effectively addresses intent deviation in LLM agents through a real-to-virtual data synthesis approach that generates targeted negative samples, enabling significant improvements in both task completion and intent alignment compared to existing methods.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.

*Ivan Carrera,Daniel Maldonado-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Plausibility Trap" - the wasteful use of expensive AI models for simple deterministic tasks, proposes a framework for when to use/avoid generative AI, and argues for curriculum changes in digital literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing problem of inefficient AI usage where people deploy expensive probabilistic models (like LLMs) for simple deterministic tasks like OCR or basic verification, resulting in significant computational waste and latency penalties.

Method: The authors use micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking to quantify the efficiency tax, and introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix framework to guide developers on appropriate tool selection.

Result: The research demonstrates a ~6.5x latency penalty when using AI models for deterministic tasks, identifies risks of algorithmic sycophancy, and provides a practical framework for making better tool selection decisions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that true digital literacy requires knowing not only how to use generative AI but also when to avoid it, and argues for a curriculum shift to emphasize this balanced understanding.

Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

Conclusion: The proposed deep reinforcement learning approach with time-aware network embeddings effectively solves finite-time horizon vehicle routing problems, outperforming existing methods in both service rate and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon. In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.

Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

*Yuval Kansal,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bottom-up learning approach using knowledge graphs as implicit reward models enables LLMs to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized domains like medicine, outperforming larger frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at structured reasoning in domains like math and programming, they struggle with compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields where they need to combine basic facts to solve complex, unseen tasks.

Method: A post-training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, where knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. Novel reward signals are derived from knowledge graph paths to provide verifiable, scalable supervision that encourages composing intermediate axioms rather than optimizing only final answers.

Result: A 14B model trained on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) achieves significant zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops), outperforming much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on difficult reasoning tasks. The approach also shows robustness to adversarial perturbations in option-shuffling stress tests.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning processes in structured knowledge through knowledge graph-derived rewards provides a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent compositional reasoning in specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianVLA addresses information collapse in VLA models by using Bayesian decomposition to enforce instruction following, improving generalization without new data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with generalization to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios due to dataset bias where language instructions are predictable from visual observations alone, causing information collapse where models ignore language constraints.

Method: Proposes BayesianVLA framework with learnable Latent Action Queries and dual-branch architecture to estimate both vision-only prior p(a|v) and language-conditioned posterior π(a|v,ℓ), optimizing policy to maximize conditional Pointwise Mutual Information between actions and instructions.

Result: Significantly improves generalization with 11.3% improvement on challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, demonstrating robust language grounding in action across SimplerEnv and RoboCasa experiments.

Conclusion: BayesianVLA effectively addresses information collapse in VLA training by penalizing vision shortcuts and rewarding actions that explain language commands, enabling better instruction following without requiring additional data collection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

Conclusion: The integration of LLM-based agentic AI with edge computing shows promise for scalable and resilient UAV swarm autonomy, though open challenges remain for mission-critical applications, particularly in the areas of LLM-edge computing integration.

Abstract: The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality.

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for occluded strawberries using Monte Carlo dropout for shape completion, generating multiple hypotheses, and using lower confidence bound for safe grasp decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic strawberry harvesting faces challenges with partial occlusion where leaves create geometric uncertainty, making single deterministic shape estimates unreliable for grasp decisions.

Method: Uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, evaluates grasp feasibility with force-closure metrics, and applies conservative lower confidence bound criterion for grasp decisions.

Result: Outperforms deterministic baselines in both simulation and physical robot experiments, enabling reliable abstention from high-risk grasps under severe occlusion while maintaining robust execution when geometric confidence is sufficient.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware decision making improves robotic strawberry harvesting reliability by explicitly modeling completion uncertainty and using conservative confidence bounds for safe grasp decisions.

Abstract: Robotic strawberry harvesting is challenging under partial occlusion, where leaves induce significant geometric uncertainty and make grasp decisions based on a single deterministic shape estimate unreliable. From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.

TL;DR: TacUMI is a multi-modal data collection system with integrated sensors for human demonstrations, plus a segmentation framework for decomposing complex manipulation tasks into meaningful modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual and proprioceptive data alone often fail to reveal event transitions in complex, contact-rich manipulation tasks, requiring better multi-modal data collection and robust segmentation methods.

Method: 1) TacUMI system: Extends UMI with ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker in a compact gripper design for synchronized multi-modal data collection. 2) Multi-modal segmentation framework: Uses temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations.

Result: Achieved over 90% segmentation accuracy on a challenging cable mounting task, with performance improving as more modalities are used.

Conclusion: TacUMI provides a practical foundation for scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Task decomposition is critical for understanding and learning complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.

### [135] [Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14622)
*Ling Xiao,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper studies prompt design for social robot navigation using small VLMs, exploring system guidance and motivational framing to improve socially compliant behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior in social robot navigation, which is critical for small VLMs with weaker decision-making capabilities compared to large language models.

Method: The study explores prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments are conducted on two socially compliant navigation datasets.

Result: Three key findings: 1) For non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans works best; for finetuned models, competition against past self works best. 2) Inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance. 3) Direct finetuning improves semantic-level metrics but yields limited action accuracy gains, while system prompts produce disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement, demonstrating the importance of principled prompt design for socially compliant navigation with small VLMs.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic policies struggle with dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion, while biological systems can rapidly acquire skills from sparse experience. The paper aims to bridge this gap by mimicking the structural organization of the bio-nervous system.

Method: A system-level bio-inspired design with three components: 1) a high-level model for goal planning (cortex analog), 2) an adaptive cerebellum module for motion stabilization using high-frequency sensor feedback, and 3) a bio-inspired spinal layer for lightning-fast action generation. This represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with emergence of biological motor characteristics: eliminates shaking in robotic arms, operates with extremely low power consumption (0.4W on neuromorphic processor), demonstrates temporal memory ability, and triggers safety reflexes in under 20 milliseconds.

Conclusion: NeuroVLA successfully demonstrates that mimicking the structural organization of the bio-nervous system enables robots to achieve biological-like motion characteristics without additional data or special guidance, representing a significant advancement in neuromorphic robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied intelligence have leveraged massive scaling of data and model parameters to master natural-language command following and multi-task control. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.

### [137] [Landing-Induced Viscoelastic Changes in an Anthropomimetic Foot Joint Structure are Modulated by Foot Structure and Posture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14634)
*Satoru Hashimoto,Yinlai Jiang,Hiroshi Yokoi,Shunta Togo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Anthropomimetic foot with human-like skeletal geometry shows higher damping than simplified feet, and posture (ankle/toe position) tunes impact attenuation vs rebound trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cadaver studies can't repeatedly test posture-dependent viscoelastic responses after landing impact, leaving skeletal architecture's contribution to landing dynamics incompletely understood.

Method: Developed anthropomimetic foot joint structure replicating human skeletal geometry, used vertical drop apparatus simulating landing with viscoelastic system-identification model to study how skeletal structure and posture modulate post-impact viscoelastic response.

Result: Multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure had higher damping ratio than flat/rigid feet. Ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted parameters, reducing damping ratio under tested conditions.

Conclusion: Arch-like multi-jointed skeletal architecture enhances impact attenuation in mechanical foot, and morphology/passive posture alone can tune attenuation-rebound trade-off. Posture-dependent trends consistent with human landing strategies, suggesting skeletal architecture partly accounts for modulation. Anatomically informed skeletal replication offers engineering advantage for achieving human-like viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment.

Abstract: Cadaveric studies have provided important insights into the mechanics of the human foot arch and plantar fascia. However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination to improve mobile manipulation efficiency and spatial generalization by focusing on critical experience fragments and planning with coupled dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulation faces low sample efficiency due to ineffective use of redundant data in long trajectories, and poor spatial generalization where policies trained on specific tasks struggle with new spatial layouts without retraining.

Method: Uses Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) to focus on critical experience fragments affecting task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Combines AES with a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) that captures coupled dynamics between mobile base and manipulator to imagine future manipulations.

Result: Comparative studies show the method significantly outperforms existing mobile manipulation policies across different experimental configurations. Real-world experiments validate feasibility and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed AES and RSSM-based MPFP approach effectively addresses sample efficiency and spatial generalization challenges in mobile manipulation, enabling better skill learning and transfer to new spatial layouts.

Abstract: Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.

TL;DR: FARE is a hierarchical robot exploration framework that combines LLM-based global reasoning with RL-based local control, using fast-slow thinking paradigm for efficient autonomous exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance autonomous robot exploration by integrating high-level semantic reasoning with fast local decision-making, addressing the need for both strategic planning and reactive control in unknown environments.

Method: FARE uses a two-tier architecture: 1) Slow-thinking LLM module interprets environment descriptions and synthesizes exploration strategies, grounding them into global waypoints via topological graph with modularity-based pruning; 2) Fast-thinking RL module executes local exploration guided by waypoints with reward shaping for adherence.

Result: FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines in challenging simulated environments, and successfully validates in complex large-scale hardware deployment (200m×130m building environment).

Conclusion: The hierarchical architecture effectively decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision-making, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop exploration behavior by operating each module at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.

Abstract: This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\times130m$ building environment.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions. Potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

Abstract: Soft robotic instruments could navigate delicate, tortuous anatomy more safely than rigid tools, but clinical adoption is limited by insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback at the tissue interface. Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tool localization is crucial for patient safety in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), but remains challenging for cable-driven robots like da Vinci due to erroneous encoder readings causing pose estimation errors.

Method: Proposes a calibration framework with two interrelated algorithms: 1) feature association block for robust key point correspondences from monocular images without pre-training, and 2) hand-eye calibration block using filter approaches to accommodate various surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration framework effectively addresses tool localization challenges in cable-driven surgical robots by providing accurate, time-efficient pose estimation through on-the-fly hand-eye calibration, enhancing patient safety and surgical task execution in RMIS.

Abstract: In Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), accurate tool localization is crucial to ensure patient safety and successful task execution. However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of VLMs in robotics faces challenges: high latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks from cloud offloading. Edge intelligence in 6G networks (ORAN/MEC) offers a solution by bringing computation closer to data sources.

Conclusion: Edge deployment on 6G ORAN/MEC infrastructure enables efficient VLM deployment for robotics, balancing latency reduction with accuracy preservation. Compact models offer viable alternatives for resource-constrained scenarios despite accuracy compromises.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable multimodal reasoning for robotic perception and interaction, but their deployment in real-world systems remains constrained by latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks of cloud offloading. Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions.

*Yuteng Sun,Haoran Wang,Ruofei Bai,Zhengguo Li,Jun Li,Meng Yee,Chuah,Wei Yun Yau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIDAL is a hierarchical framework that enables high-frequency control for diffusion-based VLAs by decoupling semantic reasoning from actuation, achieving ~9Hz updates vs ~2.4Hz baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VLA models have high inference latency, forcing low-frequency batch-and-execute operation that fails in dynamic environments where targets move during execution windows.

Method: Dual-frequency architecture with low-frequency macro-intent loop caching semantic embeddings and high-frequency micro-control loop interleaving flow integration with execution. Includes temporally misaligned training for predictive compensation and differential motion predictor for velocity sensitivity.

Result: 2x performance gain in dynamic interception tasks, 4x increase in feedback frequency (~9Hz vs ~2.4Hz), extends semantic embedding horizon beyond native action chunk size, robust under non-paused inference.

Conclusion: TIDAL enables high-frequency control for VLAs without increasing computational overhead, making them viable for dynamic environments while maintaining semantic generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.

Motivation: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low, creating a need for automated disassembly systems to improve recycling efficiency and reduce manual labor.

Method: The system uses a camera-equipped arm to identify parts and estimate poses, encodes disassembly constraints in a directed graph, uses topological ordering for scheduling, and coordinates dual-arm execution with one arm handling screws and the other handling components.

Result: The system successfully demonstrated consistent full disassembly of 3.5-inch hard drives with high success rates and efficient cycle times, showing adaptive coordination of dual-arm tasks in real time.

Conclusion: eGRAP provides an effective approach for autonomous electronic device disassembly that can adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time, addressing the e-waste recycling challenge.

Abstract: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low. We propose an electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) that integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution for autonomous disassembly. A camera-equipped arm identifies parts and estimates their poses, and a directed graph encodes which parts must be removed first. A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online. Experiments show consistent full disassembly of each HDD, with high success rates and efficient cycle times, illustrating the method's ability to adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DWPP reformulates pure pursuit to incorporate velocity/acceleration constraints in velocity space, improving tracking accuracy by avoiding constraint-violating commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pure pursuit methods don't explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, causing discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that lead to overshoot and degraded tracking performance.

Method: Dynamic Window Pure Pursuit (DWPP) reformulates command velocity computation in velocity space (v-ω plane), selecting command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that's closest to the line ω=κv.

Result: DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared to conventional pure pursuit methods. The method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository.

Conclusion: DWPP provides a computationally efficient pure pursuit variant that explicitly handles velocity/acceleration constraints, improving practical path-tracking performance for mobile robots.

Abstract: Pure pursuit and its variants are widely used for mobile robot path tracking owing to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$ω$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $ω= κv$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods. The proposed method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository and is publicly available (https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2).

TL;DR: A general method for accurate risk estimation in automated driving that combines collision probability estimation with collision severity, allowing individual severity functions for different collision types and being computationally efficient for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety is crucial for automated vehicles, requiring accurate risk assessment for motion planning and safety evaluation. Existing approaches lack generalizability and accuracy due to empirical modeling or severe approximations.

Method: Combines recent advances in collision probability estimation with collision severity concepts to develop a general risk estimation method. Allows assignment of individual severity functions for different collision constellations (e.g., frontal vs side collisions).

Result: The proposed approach is computationally efficient, suitable for real-time motion planning applications. Programming code for an exemplary implementation with Gaussian uncertainties is provided.

Conclusion: The method provides accurate and generalizable risk estimation for automated driving by properly addressing both uncertainty in state estimates and collision severity, enabling safer motion planning around traffic participants.

Abstract: Safety is a central requirement for automated vehicles. As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely data-driven deep learning approaches for robotic object recognition lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage pre-existing environmental knowledge, leading to less robust scene understanding.

Method: Incremental construction of 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSG) integrated with expectations from contextual priors (past observations) and external semantic knowledge (ConceptNet), embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for expectation-biased inference.

Result: The approach moves beyond static frame-by-frame analysis to enhance robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time, with planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.

Conclusion: Knowledge-level expectations combined with sensor data through 3DSSG and GNNs can significantly improve robotic object interpretation by providing semantic consistency and leveraging environmental knowledge.

Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced robotic object recognition, purely data-driven approaches often lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage valuable, pre-existing knowledge about the environment. This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.

*Jiyao Zhang,Zhiyuan Ma,Tianhao Wu,Zeyuan Chen,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CADGrasp: A two-stage algorithm for dexterous grasping in cluttered environments using single-view point clouds, featuring sparse IBS representation prediction and optimization-based grasp generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments is challenging due to high DoF of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions from diverse object geometries and complex layouts.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Predict sparse IBS (scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation) using occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure filtering; 2) Develop energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate grasp poses.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world settings validate effectiveness, demonstrating capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

Conclusion: CADGrasp successfully addresses dexterous grasping challenges in cluttered environments through a novel two-stage approach using sparse IBS representation and optimization, enabling collision-free and stable grasping.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

### [152] [Systematic Evaluation of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Parameters for Enhancing Gait Stability During Ground Slip Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15056)
*Maria T. Tagliaferri,Inseung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hip exoskeleton assistance parameters (magnitude and duration) significantly affect stability during slip perturbations, with duration being crucial for determining stabilizing vs. destabilizing effects. Stability-optimal parameters reduced whole-body angular momentum by 25.7% compared to energy-optimized controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalization and mortality in older adults. While lower-limb exoskeletons have potential to improve gait stability, most controllers are optimized for energy efficiency rather than stability, leaving the effects of specific assistance parameters unexplored.

Method: Systematically modulated magnitude and duration of torque from a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults. Quantified stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM) and compared responses to existing energy-optimized controllers.

Result: WBAM responses showed significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing. Stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% compared to energy-optimized controllers. Substantial inter-subject variability was observed in optimal parameter combinations.

Conclusion: Optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energy efficiency alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability. Stability-focused control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization, representing an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control for fall prevention.

Abstract: Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.

*Yanran Jiang,Pavan Sikka,Leimin Tian,Dana Kuliic,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores how users with different robotics expertise levels (novice, intermediate, expert) supervise autonomous robots, examining their intervention timing and decision-making strategies when robots encounter difficulties in tunnel exploration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots become more autonomous and are supervised by users with varying expertise levels, it's important to understand how different users approach supervision tasks and how this affects human-robot team performance.

Method: Conducted a user study with 27 participants who supervised a robot autonomously exploring four unknown tunnel environments in a simulator. Participants provided waypoints to intervene when they believed the robot had encountered difficulties. Researchers analyzed interaction data and questionnaire responses.

Result: Identified differing patterns in intervention timing and decision-making strategies across novice, intermediate, and expert users when supervising autonomous robots.

Conclusion: User expertise level significantly influences how people supervise autonomous robots, with different intervention patterns and decision-making strategies emerging across expertise levels, highlighting the need for adaptive supervision interfaces.

Abstract: With increasing levels of robot autonomy, robots are increasingly being supervised by users with varying levels of robotics expertise. As the diversity of the user population increases, it is important to understand how users with different expertise levels approach the supervision task and how this impacts performance of the human-robot team. This exploratory study investigates how operators with varying expertise levels perceive information and make intervention decisions when supervising a remote robot. We conducted a user study (N=27) where participants supervised a robot autonomously exploring four unknown tunnel environments in a simulator, and provided waypoints to intervene when they believed the robot had encountered difficulties. By analyzing the interaction data and questionnaire responses, we identify differing patterns in intervention timing and decision-making strategies across novice, intermediate, and expert users.

### [154] [V-CAGE: Context-Aware Generation and Verification for Scalable Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15164)
*Yaru Liu,Ao-bo Wang,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: V-CAGE is a closed-loop framework for generating physically plausible, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale using context-aware scene instantiation, hierarchical instruction decomposition, and VLM-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods have limitations: generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs can "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable actions.

Method: 1) Context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis using dynamic prohibited spatial area mapping. 2) Hierarchical instruction decomposition module that breaks high-level goals into compositional action primitives. 3) VLM-based verification loop that performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask to filter out "silent failures."

Result: V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.

Conclusion: The closed-loop framework with physical plausibility enforcement and semantic verification enables robust, scalable generation of manipulation datasets for learning long-horizon embodied behaviors.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "get ready for work") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out "silent failures" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MonoRace: An onboard monocular camera + IMU drone racing system that won the 2025 A2RL competition, beating human champions at speeds up to 100 km/h without external tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drone racing requires AI that can run on lightweight drones under tight resource constraints while pushing physical limits. Current state-of-the-art uses stereo cameras and IMUs in controlled indoor environments, but there's a need for systems that work in competition environments without external motion tracking.

Method: Combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with drone model for robust state estimation. Features offline optimization using known gate geometry to refine state estimation parameters from onboard flight data. Uses a small neural network for guidance and control that directly sends motor commands at 500Hz, bypassing inner loop controllers.

Result: Won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots. Reached speeds up to 100 km/h on competition track and successfully handled camera interference and IMU saturation problems.

Conclusion: MonoRace sets a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research by demonstrating high-performance racing with only monocular camera and IMU, without external tracking, in real competition environments against human champions.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.

*Alex Echeverria,Sávio Salvarino Teles de Oliveira,Fernando Marques Federson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automated pipeline converts noisy call center audio recordings into clean Q&A instructional datasets for LLM fine-tuning, successfully demonstrated with Llama 2 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need high-quality instructional datasets for domain adaptation, but generating these from unstructured call center audio is challenging due to noise and disorganization.

Method: End-to-end automated pipeline with sequential steps: audio processing (diarization, noise removal, transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, anonymization), semantic extraction using vector embeddings, and semantic search matching to form Q&A pairs.

Result: Successfully implemented complete pipeline generating dataset for Instruct Fine Tuning, validated by successfully fine-tuning Llama 2 7B model, with code made publicly available.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for converting unstructured call center conversations into valuable LLM training resources, potentially enabling more effective AI systems for customer service Q&A tasks.

Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

### [157] [GCG Attack On A Diffusion LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14266)
*Ruben Neyroud,Sam Corley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCG adversarial attacks on diffusion LLMs (LLaDA) show they're vulnerable, requiring new optimization strategies for this model type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GCG attacks work well on autoregressive LLMs, their effectiveness on diffusion-based LLMs like LLaDA remains unexplored, creating a gap in understanding diffusion model robustness.

Method: Conducted exploratory study using GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA, evaluating multiple attack variants including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation on harmful prompts from AdvBench dataset.

Result: Initial insights reveal diffusion language models have vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, demonstrating they're not inherently more robust than autoregressive models.

Conclusion: Diffusion LLMs require alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis, as traditional GCG approaches need adaptation for this different generation paradigm.

Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

### [158] [Divide and Refine: Enhancing Multimodal Representation and Explainability for Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14274)
*Anh-Tuan Mai,Cam-Van Thi Nguyen,Duc-Trong Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DnR framework explicitly decomposes multimodal signals into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, then refines them with tailored objectives for better emotion recognition in conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal emotion recognition methods often fail to properly balance and preserve the three information-theoretic components: modality-unique signals, cross-modal redundancy, and synergistic interactions. Augmentation-based approaches can blur these distinctions when applied to raw inputs or fused embeddings.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Divide phase explicitly decomposes each modality into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy components. 2) Refine phase uses tailored objectives to enhance informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles, resulting in plug-and-play compatible representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition and refinement of multimodal signals into unique, redundant, and synergistic components provides a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition in conversations, with the DnR framework offering plug-and-play compatibility with diverse multimodal pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

*Zewen Yang,Xiaobing Dai,Jiajun Cheng,Yulong Huang,Peng Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process regression that prioritizes quality over quantity by enabling agents to assess and select higher-quality neighboring models based on prediction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed learning approaches often indiscriminately include all agent models for joint prediction, which is irrational. The paper argues that quality should be prioritized over quantity in cooperative learning, as not all models contribute equally to prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes distributed error-informed GP (EIGP) framework with three key components: 1) Selection function for agents to assess and choose higher-quality neighboring GP models based on prediction errors, 2) Greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction, 3) Adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. Also includes fast prediction/model update approaches using error-informed quantification term iteration and data deletion strategy for real-time operations.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art distributed GP methods across different benchmarks. The selective approach outperforms indiscriminate inclusion of all models.

Conclusion: Quality should be prioritized over quantity in distributed cooperative learning. The proposed EIGP framework successfully enables selective model collaboration, improves prediction accuracy and efficiency, and achieves real-time learning operations through algorithmic enhancements and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization helps deploy large language models on constrained hardware, but inconsistent evaluation of available formats makes it difficult to choose appropriate schemes for local deployment.

Method: Conducted unified empirical study of llama.cpp quantization on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats, evaluating downstream task performance, perplexity, CPU throughput, model size, compression, and quantization time.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation results across reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, along with performance metrics to help users make informed decisions based on their specific use cases and resource constraints.

Conclusion: Provides a practical guide for selecting llama.cpp quantization schemes, enabling users to make context-aware decisions balancing model performance, resource usage, and deployment feasibility for local hardware constraints.

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

### [161] [On the Limits of Learned Importance Scoring for KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14279)
*Brady Steele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned KV cache compression via Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP) fails to outperform simple position-based heuristics, suggesting limited utility of complex learned approaches for token importance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether learned approaches can effectively predict token importance for KV cache compression, potentially improving efficiency in large language models by identifying which tokens to retain in the cache.

Method: Proposed Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone, using multi-horizon lookahead and cross-attention architectures. Compared against simple baselines including random selection and position-based heuristics across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks.

Result: SIP does not outperform simple baselines including random selection. Position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches. Prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers. Marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction.

Conclusion: Complex learned approaches for KV cache compression may not be necessary; simple position-based heuristics are surprisingly effective. The difficulty may stem from circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories, limiting the utility of KV representations alone for importance prediction.

Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a benchmark to compare 15 structure-based drug design models across three algorithmic categories (search-based, deep generative, reinforcement learning), evaluating pharmaceutical properties, docking affinities, and binding poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBDD research lacks cross-algorithm comparisons, with most works only comparing models within the same algorithmic category. The authors aim to fill this gap by creating a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation across different algorithmic foundations.

Method: Established a benchmark evaluating 15 models from three algorithmic categories: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. Assessment includes pharmaceutical properties of generated molecules, docking affinities, and binding poses with target proteins. Also demonstrated that 1D/2D ligand-centric methods can be adapted to SBDD using docking functions as black-box oracles.

Result: 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models perform well on standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance with high chemical validity and moderate binding scores. Distinct patterns emerged across model categories with specific strengths and weaknesses identified.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides insights for combining strengths of different approaches while addressing limitations. Recommendations are offered for future SBDD model design, emphasizing the value of cross-algorithm comparisons and the adaptability of 1D/2D methods to SBDD tasks.

Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

*Pengyu Liu,Mariel Vázquez,Nataša Jonoska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree polynomials encode tree structures as matrices for data analytics; distance-based clustering with normalized distances performs best for tree structure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree structures are prevalent in life sciences (phylogenetics, RNA structures), and new sequencing/AI technologies generate abundant tree-structured data requiring novel analytics methods.

Method: Use tree polynomials to encode tree structures as matrices, compare different distance metrics in tree clustering methods, implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using polynomials.

Result: Distance-based methods with entry-level normalized distances achieve the highest clustering accuracy among compared methods.

Conclusion: Tree polynomials provide efficient tree encoding for data analytics, and distance-based clustering with normalized distances is effective for tree structure analysis in biological applications.

Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM memory systems have two key problems: 1) complex memory construction is computationally expensive with minimal performance benefits, and 2) simple context concatenation fails to effectively translate retrieval recall into reasoning accuracy.

Method: CoM framework uses lightweight memory construction paired with sophisticated utilization via Chain-of-Memory mechanism, which organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution and adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise.

Result: CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4% on LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks, while reducing computational overhead to ~2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed CoM framework demonstrates that shifting from complex memory construction to lightweight construction with sophisticated utilization (Chain-of-Memory) significantly improves both performance and efficiency for LLM memory systems.

Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

*Jun Liu,Leo Yu Zhang,Fengpeng Li,Isao Echizen,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new hard-label black-box attack framework that reframes existing attacks as gradient sign recovery and proposes a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with Pattern-Driven Optimization for improved query efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-label black-box settings with only top-1 predicted labels are practically important but fundamentally constrained. The central challenge is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from discrete responses, and existing attacks lack theoretical grounding.

Method: Develops a unified theoretical perspective showing existing attacks approximate gradient sign recovery. Proposes a new attack framework with zero-query frequency-domain initialization and Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy.

Result: The method surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in attack success rate and query efficiency on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, works on various models including commercial APIs and CLIP, generalizes to other domains, and circumvents Blacklight defense with 0% detection rate.

Conclusion: Hard-label attacks can be understood as gradient sign recovery, and the proposed framework provides theoretical guarantees and practical improvements in query efficiency, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse settings and defenses.

Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

TL;DR: LAEP is a layer-adaptive expert pruning algorithm for MoE LLMs that selectively prunes underutilized experts during pre-training to improve efficiency and reduce model size while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE LLMs have superior accuracy with fewer active parameters, but their pre-training is computationally inefficient due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency.

Method: LAEP algorithm selectively prunes underutilized experts and reorganizes experts across computing devices based on token distribution statistics during pre-training stage.

Result: LAEP achieves 48.3% improvement in training efficiency and 33.3% parameter reduction when pre-training 1010B Base model, while maintaining excellent performance across multiple domains.

Conclusion: LAEP effectively addresses the computational bottleneck in MoE LLM pre-training by pruning experts adaptively during training, offering significant efficiency gains without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Contextual Bandit algorithms struggle in dynamic fantasy sports environments with rapid user behavior changes and dramatic reward distribution shifts, requiring frequent retraining.

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework that dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad system-wide insights to detailed user-specific contexts, uses contextual similarity for policy transfer, and integrates uplift modeling principles.

Result: Large-scale A/B testing on Dream11 platform showed 0.4% revenue improvement and better user satisfaction metrics. Production deployment in May 2025 yielded additional 0.5% revenue improvement.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses dynamic environment challenges in fantasy sports recommendations, improving both revenue and user satisfaction, and has been successfully deployed to production.

Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Field-Space Autoencoder: A scalable climate emulation framework using spherical compression and attention to handle petabyte-scale kilometer-resolution climate model outputs, enabling efficient generative emulation and zero-shot super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are computationally expensive and produce massive outputs (petabyte-scale), limiting their utility for applications like probabilistic risk assessment. There's a need to bridge the gap between abundant low-resolution ensemble statistics and scarce high-resolution physical detail.

Method: Field-Space Autoencoder with Field-Space Attention that operates directly on native spherical climate model outputs, avoiding geometric distortions from Euclidean grids. Uses a structured compressed field as baseline for downstream generative diffusion models that can simultaneously learn from both low-resolution ensembles and sparse high-resolution data.

Result: The approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines, serves as good baseline for generative emulation, and enables zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into shared representation.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between high-volume low-resolution ensemble statistics and scarce high-resolution physical detail, providing a scalable solution for climate emulation that can handle petabyte-scale outputs while maintaining physical fidelity.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

*Krishna Sharma,Vivek Yelleti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework for cross-domain log anomaly detection that addresses class imbalance and data drift using semantic embeddings, feature selection, and MAML/Prototypical Networks with SMOTE oversampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log anomaly detection faces challenges of class imbalance and poor cross-domain generalization due to data drift and lack of labeled anomalies in new domains, requiring adaptation from source to target domains.

Method: Uses Drain3 log parsing with dynamic drift-based labeling for knowledge transfer, BERT-based semantic embeddings, feature selection, MAML and Prototypical Networks meta-learning models, and SMOTE oversampling for imbalance handling.

Result: The proposed meta-learning approach achieved the highest mean F1 score in cross-domain settings using leave-one-out source evaluation.

Conclusion: The meta-learning-driven framework effectively addresses cross-domain log anomaly detection challenges, outperforming traditional methods in handling data drift and class imbalance.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is essential for system reliability, but it is extremely challenging to do considering it involves class imbalance. Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported. Our empirical findings validate that the proposed meta-learning-driven approach yielded the highest mean F1 score and proved to be effective for cross-domain settings.

### [170] [DiSPA: Differential Substructure-Pathway Attention for Drug Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14346)
*Yewon Han,Sunghyun Kim,Eunyi Jeong,Sungkyung Lee,Seokwoo Yun,Sangsoo Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSPA is a representation learning framework that disentangles structure-driven and context-driven drug response mechanisms through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for drug response prediction treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. Standard attention mechanisms are also sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability.

Method: DiSPA uses a representation learning framework with explicit disentanglement of structure-driven and context-driven drug response mechanisms through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. It introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions.

Result: DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting (generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations). The framework yields mechanistically informative representations that recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. It also enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining.

Conclusion: DiSPA establishes a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling that enables principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation, with demonstrated generalization capabilities and transferability to new data modalities.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VJEPA introduces a probabilistic version of JEPA that learns predictive distributions over latent states via variational objectives, enabling uncertainty-aware planning without pixel reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JEPA formulations use deterministic regression objectives that mask probabilistic semantics and limit applicability in stochastic control settings. There's a need for probabilistic generalization that can handle uncertainty and noisy environments.

Method: Introduces Variational JEPA (VJEPA) with variational objectives to learn predictive distributions over future latent states. Extends to Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA) that factorizes predictive belief into learned dynamics expert and modular prior expert using Product of Experts.

Result: VJEPA unifies representation learning with PSRs and Bayesian filtering, provides formal collapse avoidance guarantees, and enables zero-shot task transfer. Empirically filters out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause collapse in generative baselines.

Conclusion: VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional noisy environments while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

TL;DR: Online adaptive method converts risk scores into review queues under capacity constraints using kernel density estimation and tail-mass curves, operating label-free in real-time with minimal threshold jitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches like top-K or manually tuned cutoffs for converting risk scores into review queues are inflexible and don't adapt well to changing data distributions or explicit intake constraints.

Method: Fits online adaptive kernel density to score stream, transforms density into tail-mass curve to meet capacity constraints, and "snaps" resulting cut to persistent density valleys detected across bandwidths. Supports multi-queue routing with sliding windows or exponential forgetting.

Result: Achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter on synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams. Operates in real-time with O(G) update cost per event and constant memory per activity.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible, label-free approach for real-time risk score queueing that adapts to changing data distributions while maintaining capacity constraints with minimal threshold instability.

Abstract: We study the problem of converting a stream of risk scores into one or more review queues under explicit intake constraints[cite: 6]. Instead of top-$K$ or manually tuned cutoffs, we fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform the density into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and ``snap'' the resulting cut to a persistent density valley detected across bandwidths[cite: 7]. The procedure is label-free, supports multi-queue routing, and operates in real time with sliding windows or exponential forgetting[cite: 8]. On synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams, the method achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter[cite: 9]. Updates cost $O(G)$ per event with constant memory per activity

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework for multi-modal edge inference that reduces training communication overhead while maintaining robustness to channel variations and noisy inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communication is crucial for distributed edge intelligence, but faces challenges in communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links, especially for multi-modal systems with prohibitive communication overhead and limited robustness to varying channels and noisy inputs.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Local multi-modal self-supervised learning without device-server exchange; 2) Distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion to calibrate uncertainty and aggregate noisy features; 3) Uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism that selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples.

Result: The framework achieves higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines on RGB-depth indoor scene classification.

Conclusion: The proposed communication-aware distributed learning framework effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal edge inference by reducing communication overhead while maintaining robustness, enabling efficient and reliable semantic communication for distributed edge intelligence.

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

Method: Developed a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework using CUDA that models three key device variability factors: timing, intensity, and offset variability in p-bits implemented with magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).

Result: Achieved two-order magnitude (100x) speedup over CPU implementations on MAX-CUT benchmark problems ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. Discovered that device variability, particularly timing variability, can enhance algorithm performance rather than just degrade it.

Conclusion: Device variability in p-bit implementations should be reconsidered as a potential performance enhancer rather than just a limitation. The developed framework provides an accessible tool for advancing probabilistic computing research and enabling optimization applications across diverse fields.

Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -timing, intensity, and offset- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSR-HINE: hierarchical implicit forecaster for chaotic systems using multiscale latent priors and multi-rate recurrent modules to mitigate error accumulation in long-horizon forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems is challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift, where small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics.

Method: Hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step: coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, implicit one-step predictor refines state with multiscale latent injections, gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates, and lightweight hidden-state correction aligns recurrent memories with fused latents.

Result: On Kuramoto-Sivashinsky: reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400, improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extends ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps. On Lorenz-96: reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100, improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extends ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

Conclusion: MSR-HINE maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, effectively mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts and substantially outperforming baseline methods on canonical chaotic system benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unifying framework to analyze Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs) through three dimensions: what is learned, how physics is integrated, and computational amortization across problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches for PDEs, there's no unified perspective to understand their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. The field lacks a coherent framework to analyze these methods systematically.

Method: The authors propose a unifying perspective that organizes existing methods along three fundamental dimensions: 1) what is learned (e.g., solutions, operators, parameters), 2) how physical structures are integrated into learning (e.g., through loss functions, architecture constraints), and 3) how computational load is amortized across problem instances.

Result: The framework provides a shared design space that places PINNs and NOs within a common analytical structure, allowing systematic comparison and revealing how challenges in learning-based PDE solvers stem from these structural properties.

Conclusion: This unifying view facilitates development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyzes synthesis of physics and data by providing a systematic way to understand relationships, limitations, and appropriate applications of different approaches.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.

*Giulio Rossolini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks may not reliably estimate robustness to random noise; the paper introduces a probabilistic framework to evaluate when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk vs. when it fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's ongoing debate about whether adversarial perturbations are valid proxies for robustness to random perturbations. The paper aims to determine if adversarial attacks provide representative estimates of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or if they reflect atypical worst-case events that don't generalize to typical noise scenarios.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor κ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Proposes an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise to study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk.

Result: Systematic benchmarking on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 reveals when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails. The experiments highlight conditions under which widely used attacks provide valid estimates of robustness to random perturbations versus when they overestimate vulnerability by focusing on atypical worst-case scenarios.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks don't always reliably estimate robustness to random noise. The proposed framework helps identify when adversarial success is a meaningful proxy for noisy risk versus when it fails, providing guidance for more informed use of adversarial attacks in safety-oriented model evaluation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.

### [178] [On the Runway Cascade of Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14522)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "runway cascade" as a problem in causal transformers where indirect information paths cause redundancy, and proposes "runway-aware rewiring" to fix it without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal transformers have failure modes where information propagates through both direct attention paths and indirect "runway" paths, causing misalignment that leads to redundancies and irrelevant information cascading despite proper attention patterns.

Method: Proposes runway-aware rewiring that modifies attention patterns based on a summary of each token's runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences without adding parameters.

Result: The rewired transformer shows steady improvements in general language modeling, and noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: Runway-aware rewiring provides a more explicit way to incorporate runway context into attention, enabling balanced information propagation and addressing failure modes in causal transformers.

Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

### [179] [Search over Self-Edit Strategies for LLM Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14532)
*Alistair Cheong,Haolin Cong,Tyler Yang,Dustin Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can use task feedback to decide how to update their own weights through self-supervised next token prediction, with archive-based template generation showing promise but not surpassing human-designed strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based search systems freeze foundation models, potentially bottlenecking long-term progress. While recent work explores updating models at test time, update strategies remain hand-specified. This study investigates whether LLMs can autonomously decide how to update their weights using task feedback.

Method: Using the SEAL framework, researchers allowed models to generate their own self-edit templates (rather than using fixed human templates), giving them control over training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were tested: one without archive and one with a lightweight archive of past templates. Experiments used Qwen3-8B on SQuAD in SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting.

Result: The no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached (but did not surpass) the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline. Analysis revealed that naive archives provide short-term robustness but can accelerate homogenization.

Conclusion: LLMs can use task feedback to guide self-updates, but current approaches don't surpass carefully optimized human strategies. Explicit novelty pressure may be needed to consistently advance beyond human-designed methods, as archives can accelerate homogenization despite providing short-term benefits.

Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

### [180] [engGNN: A Dual-Graph Neural Network for Omics-Based Disease Classification and Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14536)
*Tiantian Yang,Yuxuan Wang,Zhenwei Zhou,Ching-Ti Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: engGNN is a dual-graph neural network framework that combines external biological networks with data-driven generated graphs to improve disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) have high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and complex biological networks, making reliable prediction and interpretation challenging. Existing GNN methods use either external curated graphs or data-driven graphs alone, missing complementary information.

Method: engGNN integrates two types of feature graphs: 1) a biologically informed undirected graph from established network databases, and 2) a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph framework produces more comprehensive embeddings for improved prediction and interpretability.

Result: engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both simulations and real-world gene expression applications. It provides interpretable feature importance scores that enable biologically meaningful discoveries through pathway enrichment analysis.

Conclusion: engGNN is a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts, effectively leveraging both prior biological knowledge and data-driven insights.

Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.

### [182] [QMC: Efficient SLM Edge Inference via Outlier-Aware Quantization and Emergent Memories Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14549)
*Nilesh Prasad Pandey,Jangseon Park,Onat Gungor,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QMC is a retraining-free quantization method with heterogeneous memory architecture that stores inlier weights in ReRAM and outliers in MRAM, achieving 6.3-7.3x memory reduction and 12.5x latency improvement for edge SLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of SLMs faces memory, latency, and energy constraints. Existing memory technologies (SRAM, DRAM, Flash) have limitations: SRAM is fast but low-density, DRAM has bandwidth contention for weights and KV caches, Flash is inactive during inference. Quantization suffers from device noise in emerging memories, highlighting need for hybrid memory organizations tailored for LLM inference.

Method: Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC): 1) Identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, 2) Stores inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM), 3) Preserves critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM) to mitigate noise-induced degradation. This is a retraining-free quantization approach with novel heterogeneous memory architecture.

Result: Outperforms/matches state-of-the-art quantization methods on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks. Achieves greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. On latest edge AI platform: reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x compared to FP16.

Conclusion: QMC establishes a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference, addressing the limitations of conventional memory hierarchies and quantization methods for edge SLM deployment through intelligent weight classification and heterogeneous memory organization.

Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

### [183] [Constructing Multi-label Hierarchical Classification Models for MITRE ATT&CK Text Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14556)
*Andrew Crossman,Jonah Dodd,Viralam Ramamurthy Chaithanya Kumar,Riyaz Mohammed,Andrew R. Plummer,Chandra Sekharudu,Deepak Warrier,Mohammad Yekrangian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-label hierarchical classification approach for automating MITRE ATT&CK text tagging, achieving 94% tactic-level and 82% technique-level accuracy using classical ML methods, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tagging of cybersecurity texts with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques is time-consuming and inefficient, creating a need for automated solutions to improve threat intelligence analysis workflows.

Method: Developed a stratified "task space" characterization of the tagging problem, then built multi-label hierarchical classification models using classical machine learning methods (not LLMs/RAG/agents) on cyber-threat intelligence text.

Result: Achieved 94% accuracy at tactic level and 82% at technique level, surpassing state-of-the-art and significantly outperforming GPT-4o (60% accuracy). Models were extended to financial threat scenarios and released publicly.

Conclusion: Classical ML methods can effectively automate MITRE ATT&CK tagging without complex hierarchical approaches or LLMs, providing practical, shareable tools for the security community with superior performance to current alternatives.

Abstract: MITRE ATT&CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.

*Xiaojie Yang,Dizhi Huang,Hangli Ge,Masahiro Sano,Takeaki Ohdake,Kazuma Hatano,Noboru Koshizuka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based framework uses reservation dynamics (ticket bookings/updates) as proxy for attendance intentions to forecast daily attendance at large events like Expo 2025, avoiding complex multi-source data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate daily attendance forecasting is crucial for managing transportation, crowds, and services at large international events. Existing methods rely on multi-source external data (weather, traffic, social media) which can be unreliable when historical data is insufficient.

Method: Propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics (ticket bookings and subsequent updates within time windows) as proxy for visitors' attendance intentions. Uses encoder-decoder structure with inverse-style embedding and adaptive fusion module. Evaluated under single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated East/West gates) settings.

Result: Separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, especially for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies confirm importance of encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module.

Conclusion: Reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events, avoiding complexity of multi-source integration while capturing external influences implicitly embedded in reservation patterns.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

### [185] [Counterfactual Modeling with Fine-Tuned LLMs for Health Intervention Design and Sensor Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14590)
*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs (especially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B) generate high-quality counterfactual explanations for clinical data, outperforming optimization-based methods in plausibility, validity, and clinical actionability, while also effectively augmenting training data to restore classifier performance under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability for ML models and can serve dual purposes: (1) as interventions for abnormality prevention, and (2) as augmented data for training robust models. The paper aims to evaluate LLMs for generating CFEs in clinical settings, comparing them with traditional optimization-based methods.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using LLMs including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot), BioMistral-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Uses multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset and assesses CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Compares with optimization-based baselines (DiCE, CFNOW, NICE).

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance when used for data augmentation under label scarcity, yielding average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. LLMs outperform optimization-based methods in generating clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals.

Conclusion: LLM-driven counterfactuals show promise for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health. Fine-tuned LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable explanations than traditional optimization-based methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.
  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

*Xiao Hu,Hong Xie,Tao Tan,Defu Lian,Jianyu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the fundamental questions about reinforcement learning fine-tuning for LLMs by proposing a bottom-up experiment pipeline to disentangle confounding factors and understand the role of each design choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are many heuristics for reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs but inconsistent claims make the area elusive. Two fundamental questions lack clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks?

Method: Proposes a bottom-up experiment pipeline starting with a minimalist configuration (one training data, one rollout per round, reward directly as learning signal without advantage function). This connects to multi-armed bandit learning with large discrete action space. The pipeline then expands layer by layer to examine each design choice.

Result: Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets reveal new understanding of design choices and yield essential insights to shape the area.

Conclusion: The paper provides systematic analysis to disentangle confounding factors in RL fine-tuning, offering theoretical grounding through multi-armed bandit connections and practical insights through bottom-up experimentation.

Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

*Jingru Li,Yibo Fan,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates, with two variance-adaptive variants (Muon-NSR and Muon-VS) that outperform AdamW and original Muon in convergence speed and validation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM pretraining is computationally expensive, making optimizer efficiency crucial. While Adam is effective, there's room for improvement through better momentum handling and variance adaptation.

Method: Proposes Muon optimizer with orthogonal momentum updates (matrix analogue of sign operator). Introduces two variants: Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio modulation, and Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without extra hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining show Muon-NSR and Muon-VS accelerate convergence and achieve lower validation loss than well-tuned AdamW and original Muon. For LLaMA-1.2B, they reduce iterations needed by 1.36× compared to Muon baseline.

Conclusion: Variance-adaptive orthogonal momentum updates (Muon-NSR and Muon-VS) provide superior optimization efficiency for LLM pretraining, offering faster convergence and better performance than existing optimizers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

*Yvonne Yang,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Heterogeneous GNNs combined with tabular models improve credit default prediction over standalone approaches, with hybrid ensembles achieving best performance on a massive financial graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular models for credit scoring may miss cross-entity dependencies in multi-table financial histories, while graph neural networks can capture these relational patterns.

Method: Built massive heterogeneous graph (31M+ nodes, 50M+ edges) integrating borrower attributes with transaction entities; evaluated heterogeneous GNNs (GraphSAGE, relation-aware attentive GNN) vs tabular baselines; tested hybrid ensembles combining tabular features with GNN embeddings; applied contrastive pretraining; conducted explainability and fairness analyses.

Result: Standalone GNNs provided limited improvement over gradient-boosted trees; hybrid ensemble (tabular + GNN embeddings) achieved best ROC-AUC and PR-AUC; contrastive pretraining improved optimization stability but limited downstream gains; relational signals affected subgroup behavior differently.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining GNN-derived relational embeddings with traditional tabular features outperform either method alone for credit default prediction, while structured explainability reveals how graph signals impact fairness and screening outcomes.

Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

TL;DR: CROT is an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm for handling patch-based missing data in tabular single-cell sequencing datasets, offering superior accuracy and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imputation methods struggle with large patches of missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets, assuming uniformity and data completeness, which limits meaningful biological insights from incomplete data.

Method: CROT uses optimal transport theory to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats, capturing underlying data structure even with significant missingness.

Result: CROT achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in biological and clinical data analysis.

Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis.

TL;DR: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is vulnerable to Edge Control Attack (ECA), a new fine-grained model poisoning attack that can precisely degrade competitor accuracy while evading detection.


<details>

Motivation: FRL was designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks through its discrete ranking-based mechanism, but the authors discovered it remains vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that can precisely control model accuracy without detection.

Method: Proposed Edge Control Attack (ECA) with two stages: (1) identifying/manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align global model with target model, and (2) widening selection boundary gap to stabilize global model at target accuracy.

Result: ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with average error of only 0.224% across 7 benchmark datasets and 9 Byzantine-robust aggregation rules, outperforming baseline by up to 17x.

Conclusion: FRL remains vulnerable to advanced poisoning attacks despite its design, highlighting the need for stronger defenses against such fine-grained control attacks in ranking-based FL frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

*Mohamed Abouras,Catherine M. Elias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-layered LSTM model predicts vehicle behavior on highway on/off-ramps using drone data, achieving 76% accuracy for ramp areas and 94% for general highway sections up to 4-second horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On/off-ramps are understudied road sections that introduce high variation in highway interactions, and predicting vehicle behavior in these areas can reduce uncertainty and improve road safety.

Method: Used multi-layered LSTM architecture trained on the ExiD drone dataset, comparing differences between ramp areas (Area of Interest) and straight highway sections, testing different prediction horizons and model workflows.

Result: The model shows promising results for prediction horizons up to 4 seconds, with accuracy starting at about 76% for ramp areas (AoI) and 94% for general highway scenarios at maximum horizon.

Conclusion: LSTM-based prediction models can effectively forecast vehicle behavior in challenging ramp areas, with significant accuracy differences between ramp zones and general highway sections, demonstrating potential for safety applications.

Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

*Jianwen Sun,Xinrui Li,Fuqing Li,Xiaoxuan Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EGRL-SR uses goal-conditioned reinforcement learning with hindsight experience replay to guide symbolic regression search more effectively than traditional error-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods rely on fitting error, which leads to ambiguous search directions because many expressions can have similar errors but different structures, making it hard to converge to the true function.

Method: Formulates symbolic regression as goal-conditioned RL with hindsight experience replay, uses an all-point satisfaction binary reward function to focus on structural patterns, and implements structure-guided heuristic exploration for diversity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness on public benchmarks, recovers more complex expressions under same search budget, ablation studies confirm effectiveness of action-value network guidance.

Conclusion: EGRL-SR provides a more robust approach to symbolic regression by proactively guiding search through learned action-value networks rather than relying solely on error metrics, with both reward design and exploration strategy being critical components.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to automatically identify compact and interpretable mathematical expressions that model the functional relationship between input and output variables. Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.

TL;DR: MGU introduces a memorization-guided framework for graph unlearning that addresses limitations of existing methods through accurate difficulty assessment, adaptive unlearning strategies, and comprehensive evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning methods lack understanding of key factors determining unlearning effectiveness, leading to impractical difficulty assessment, ineffectiveness on hard tasks, and misaligned evaluation protocols that fail to capture true forgetting capability.

Method: Proposes MGU (Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning) framework that establishes GNN memorization as a new perspective, provides accurate difficulty assessment, develops adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and creates comprehensive evaluation protocols.

Result: Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

Conclusion: MGU addresses fundamental limitations in graph unlearning through a memorization-guided approach, providing practical solutions for accurate difficulty assessment, effective unlearning across different task difficulties, and comprehensive evaluation aligned with real-world requirements.

Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Large Reasoning Models is unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or with weak foundation models. Current post-training scaling strategies are inefficient and need improvement.

Method: CoScale-RL uses a two-step approach: 1) Scale up solutions by collecting multiple solutions per problem instead of enlarging dataset, 2) Scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning, plus Re-distillation model merge technique for computational efficiency.

Result: The method achieves 3.76× average accuracy improvement on four benchmarks, significantly improves data and computational efficiency, and enhances LRM's ability boundary without extensive SFT dataset.

Conclusion: CoScale-RL provides a new scaling direction to further improve Large Reasoning Models' reasoning ability through better data and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBMDP is a model-based RL framework for drug discovery sequencing that uses nonparametric belief distributions from historical data to enable Bayesian planning without environment simulators, achieving 92% resource reduction in real-world CNS drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug discovery experimental sequencing faces severe uncertainty and resource constraints without access to environment simulators or transition data, making standard RL approaches infeasible. There's a need for planning methods that can work with only static historical databases.

Method: IBMDP constructs implicit transition models using nonparametric belief distributions from similar historical outcomes, enabling Bayesian belief updating. It employs ensemble Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning to balance information gain with resource efficiency.

Result: In real-world CNS drug discovery, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. In synthetic benchmarks, it achieved significantly higher alignment with optimal policies than deterministic value iteration alternatives.

Conclusion: IBMDP provides a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains, demonstrating superior planning capabilities through its case-guided implicit modeling and ensemble MCTS approach.

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

*Bizu Feng,Zhimu Yang,Shaode Yu,Zixin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSX is a hybrid GNN explainer combining internal message flow sensitivity analysis with cooperative game theory to efficiently identify critical structural interactions in model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN explainability methods face a trade-off: gradient-based approaches are efficient but ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic methods capture interactions but are computationally expensive and may deviate from the model's true reasoning.

Method: FSX combines internal message flow analysis with cooperative game theory. First, it performs flow-sensitivity analysis during a single forward pass by simulating localized node perturbations and measuring message flow intensity changes. Then it projects sensitivity-ranked flows onto input graphs to define meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, it conducts a flow-aware cooperative game using a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining/destabilizing critical flows.

Result: Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures shows FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into how important sub-structures influence predictions by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

Conclusion: FSX successfully bridges the gap between efficient gradient-based methods and comprehensive game-theoretic approaches by synergistically combining internal message flow analysis with external graph data analysis, offering both computational efficiency and deep structural understanding of GNN predictions.

Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

TL;DR: RefProtoFL: Communication-efficient federated learning framework using external reference prototypes for representation consistency and adaptive probabilistic update dropping for communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Existing prototype-based FL methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints.

Method: Decomposes model into private backbone and lightweight shared adapter, restricting communication to adapter only. Uses Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) with magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification for uplink efficiency. Employs External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) using server-held public dataset to create shared semantic anchors for representation consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

Conclusion: RefProtoFL effectively addresses communication efficiency and representation consistency challenges in federated learning through innovative prototype alignment and update dropping mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

*Injin Kong,Hyoungjoon Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training ARMs into MDMs causes fundamental computational reorganization: MDMs retain autoregressive circuits for local tasks but develop new pathways for global planning, shifting from localized to distributed processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether post-trained MDMs develop genuine bidirectional reasoning or just repackage autoregressive heuristics, and to explore the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift.

Method: Comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts, examining both structural and semantic transformations in model internals.

Result: MDMs retain autoregressive circuitry for local causal tasks but abandon initialized pathways for global planning, showing distinct rewiring with increased early-layer processing. Semantically, they shift from sharp localized specialization to distributed integration.

Conclusion: Diffusion post-training fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning, not just adapting parameters.

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

### [200] [Anytime Optimal Decision Tree Learning with Continuous Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14765)
*Harold Kiossou,Pierre Schaus,Siegfried Nijssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An anytime algorithm for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features using limited discrepancy search to improve interruption performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exact algorithms for optimal decision trees with continuous features have poor anytime behavior - when interrupted early, they produce highly unbalanced, suboptimal trees, sometimes worse than greedy methods like C4.5.

Method: Proposes an anytime yet complete approach using limited discrepancy search to distribute computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, ensuring high-quality trees at any interruption point.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of anytime performance.

Conclusion: Limited discrepancy search enables better anytime behavior for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features while maintaining completeness.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite practical success, it's unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models outperform dense networks beyond just having more parameters. The paper aims to understand the fundamental advantages of MoE architectures in handling noisy, modular data structures.

Method: The study examines an iso-parameter regime where inputs have latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise (proxy for noisy internal activations). Theoretical analysis compares MoE and dense estimators, with empirical validation on synthetic data and real-world language tasks.

Result: MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed compared to dense networks. Sparse expert activation acts as an effective noise filter, with empirical results confirming theoretical insights.

Conclusion: The key advantage of MoE models lies in their sparse modular computation acting as a noise filter, providing consistent robustness and efficiency gains beyond mere parameter scaling, particularly for data with latent modular structure corrupted by noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers, creating a need for automated generation tools.

Method: Reflection-in-reflection framework using two role-specialized LLM agents: Student-Teteacher proposes questions with rationales, Teacher-Educator evaluates along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding with coaching questions or stop signal.

Result: Dynamic stopping with contextual information outperforms fixed iterations; two-agent protocol produces substantially more relevant, deeper, and better overall questions than one-shot baseline using same backbone model.

Conclusion: The reflection-in-reflection framework effectively automates high-quality reflection question generation through multi-agent dialogue, with dynamic stopping and contextual information being key to optimal performance.

Abstract: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers. This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes kernel-based learning with distributional inputs using SVMs, establishing theoretical guarantees including oracle inequalities, consistency, learning rates, and a novel noise assumption for Gaussian kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In supervised learning with distributional inputs (common in medical screening and causal learning), the actual probability distributions are not accessible during learning—only samples from them. Kernel methods using kernel mean embeddings are promising but need stronger theoretical foundations.

Method: The authors use kernel-based learning with kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) to embed distributions/samples into a Hilbert space, then apply SVMs. They develop theoretical tools including a new oracle inequality, consistency analysis, and learning rate derivations. For Gaussian kernels with hinge loss, they formulate a novel variant of established noise assumptions.

Result: Established new oracle inequality, derived consistency and learning rate results for SVMs with distributional inputs. Formulated a novel noise assumption for Gaussian kernels with hinge loss that enables learning rate guarantees. Developed technical tools including a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces.

Conclusion: The work provides rigorous theoretical foundations for kernel-based learning with distributional inputs using SVMs, with particular contributions to classification theory, noise assumptions for Gaussian kernels, and technical tools that have independent mathematical interest.

Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard numerical optimization methods for black-box variational inference with Gaussian mixture families often suffer from instability and inefficiency when approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density.

Method: Combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping for stability and distinct warm-up/convergence phases. The approach has connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent.

Result: Proves exponential convergence for Gaussian posteriors in noise-free settings and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a stable and efficient approach for black-box variational inference with Gaussian mixture families, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping and demonstrating practical effectiveness on challenging problems.

Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM) is a framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty, outperforming general-purpose LLMs on strategic scenarios, doctrine consistency, and geopolitical forecasting benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for AI systems that can reason strategically across multiple documents while maintaining consistency with established doctrines and providing calibrated uncertainty estimates for long-horizon forecasting and planning.

Method: sdLM combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve strategic reasoning while reducing doctrinal violations.

Result: sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines across three benchmarks: expert-panel scoring (N=47), doctrine consistency on 12,847 statements, and geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals. It remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments.

Conclusion: The sdLM framework effectively addresses strategic reasoning with doctrinal constraints, demonstrating superior performance over general-purpose LLMs and competitive results with human experts, with practical deployment characteristics for operational settings.

Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models are slow and token-inefficient during inference, and existing post-training quantization methods cause large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings.

Method: Systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training for reasoning models, identifying key findings: knowledge distillation as robust objective, PTQ as initialization, reinforcement learning feasibility for quantized models, and domain alignment. Consolidated into Reasoning-QAT workflow.

Result: Reasoning-QAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. On Qwen3-0.6B, surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and recovers performance in 2-bit regime.

Conclusion: Quantization-aware training with systematic optimizations (Reasoning-QAT) enables efficient inference for reasoning models while maintaining accuracy, addressing the limitations of post-training quantization for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

TL;DR: Personalized deep learning models for blood glucose prediction outperform traditional generalized approaches by leveraging patient-specific data, enabling more accurate predictions and better management of Type 1 Diabetes in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health apps, accurate blood glucose prediction is crucial for automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems in Type 1 Diabetes management. Traditional generalized models fail to account for individual variability, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: Developed a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction using patient-specific data.

Conducted ablation studies with progressively smaller training sets to determine minimum data needed for effective personalization.

Result: Personalized models significantly improve prediction of adverse events (hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia) compared to traditional methods. Fine-tuning strategies effectively capture individual variability. Multimodal patient-specific approaches outperform CGM-only methods. Ablation studies identified minimum data requirements for effective personalization, addressing practical challenges in real-world data collection.

Conclusion: Personalized glucose prediction models show strong potential for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms. The approach enables more precise and timely interventions, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions by accounting for individual variability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

### [208] [Multimodal Rumor Detection Enhanced by External Evidence and Forgery Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14954)
*Han Li,Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal rumor detection model that combines visual forgery features, external evidence, and dual contrastive learning to detect subtle inconsistencies in social media image-text posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media rumors exploit subtle inconsistencies between images and text, with deep semantic mismatch rumors being particularly challenging. Existing methods have limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, inflexible fusion, and ignore external factual evidence needed for complex rumor verification.

Method: Uses ResNet34 visual encoder, BERT text encoder, and forgery feature module (frequency-domain traces + compression artifacts via Fourier transform). BLIP generates image descriptions to bridge semantic spaces. Dual contrastive learning between text-image and text-description pairs detects semantic inconsistencies. Gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion.

Result: Outperforms mainstream baselines on Weibo and Twitter datasets in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal rumor detection model with external evidence and forgery features effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and improves detection of subtle inconsistencies in social media posts.

Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

*Harry Mead,Bruno Lacerda,Jakob Foerster,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEGen improves UED scaling by providing denser reward signals for level generators and introducing MNA, a better regret approximation that identifies more challenging levels, leading to superior performance especially in larger environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UED methods struggle with credit assignment problems and poor regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, particularly as environment size grows. These limitations hinder effective curriculum generation for RL agents.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Environment Generation (DEGen) to provide denser reward signals for level generators, reducing credit assignment difficulty. Also introduces Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA) as an improved regret approximation metric that better identifies challenging levels.

Result: Empirical results show MNA outperforms current regret approximations, and DEGen+MNA consistently outperforms existing methods, with particularly strong performance gains as environment size increases.

Conclusion: DEGen with MNA enables UED to scale effectively to larger environments by addressing credit assignment problems and improving identification of challenging levels, leading to better curriculum generation and RL agent performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

### [210] [InstructTime++: Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling via Implicit Feature Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968)
*Mingyue Cheng,Xiaoyu Tao,Huajian Zhang,Qi Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructTime++ reformulates time series classification as multimodal generative task using language models, converting continuous sequences to discrete tokens and incorporating implicit feature modeling for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discriminative time series classification methods struggle to incorporate contextual features and capture semantic relationships among classes, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes InstructTime framework that treats time series classification as multimodal generative task with continuous sequences, contextual text, and instructions as inputs, and class labels as textual outputs. Introduces time series discretization, alignment projection, and generative self-supervised pre-training. InstructTime++ extends this with implicit feature modeling using statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning to generate textual descriptions of patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of InstructTime++ compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Reformulating time series classification as multimodal generative task with implicit feature modeling addresses limitations of discriminative approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

*Liping Chen,Mujie Liu,Haytham Fayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FG-Trac is a framework that provides verifiable, sample-level traceability in ML pipelines without modifying models, using cryptographic commitments to track individual data samples throughout preprocessing and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML transparency mechanisms operate at model level but lack sample-level traceability, leaving practitioners unable to verify when/how specific samples were used, processed, or whether records remain intact over time in multistage pipelines.

Method: FG-Trac establishes verifiable sample-level traceability through: 1) explicit mechanism for capturing/verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, 2) computing contribution scores grounded in training checkpoints, and 3) anchoring traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. It integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives.

Result: Experiments on a CNN and multimodal graph learning pipeline show FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling ML systems to provide verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution, with practical computational overhead.

Conclusion: FG-Trac provides a practical, model-agnostic solution for establishing verifiable sample-level traceability in ML pipelines, addressing the gap in current transparency mechanisms and enabling auditable data-usage histories without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.

### [212] [Lineup Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (L-RAPM): Basketball Lineup Ratings with Informed Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15000)
*Christos Petridis,Konstantinos Pelechrinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes L-RAPM, a regression-based method to evaluate basketball lineups that controls for opposition quality and leverages player information, improving prediction accuracy especially with sparse lineup data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lineup evaluation in basketball is crucial but challenging due to frequent substitutions creating highly sparse data (NBA teams use 600+ lineups per season with only 25-30 possessions each), resulting in noisy statistics with low predictive value. No existing public work addresses this problem.

Method: Regression-based approach (L-RAPM) that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup while utilizing information about the players making up the lineups.

Result: L-RAPM provides improved predictive power compared to currently used baselines, with the improvement increasing as the sample size for lineups gets smaller (i.e., with sparser data).

Conclusion: The proposed L-RAPM method effectively addresses the sparse data problem in lineup evaluation by incorporating opposition quality and player information, offering better predictive performance especially for lineups with limited playing time.

Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

*Michael Feil,Julius Lipp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RadixMLP eliminates redundant computation of shared prefixes in batch transformer inference by compressing identical segments into a trie structure for position-wise operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch inference workloads often process sequences with common prefixes (system prompts, few-shot examples, shared queries), but standard engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix.

Method: RadixMLP exploits position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings. It dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. The approach is stateless and operates within a single forward pass.

Result: In MS~MARCO v1.1 reranking benchmarks with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59× speedups in realistic workloads, with up to 5× speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

Conclusion: RadixMLP effectively eliminates redundancy in batch transformer inference by compressing shared prefixes, providing significant speedups for practical workloads with common sequence prefixes.

Conclusion: FluidGym establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control by providing a unified, differentiable benchmark suite that addresses limitations of existing AFC evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE architectures in image classification achieve slightly better accuracy than dense models with balanced expert utilization, but show different sharpness characteristics without clear generalization benefits. Naive conditional routing doesn't provide inference speedups at small scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study MoE behavior in image classification (instead of language modeling), focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization, and to understand the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

Method: Compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on CIFAR10 under comparable model capacity. Use regularization to maintain balanced expert utilization, compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics (largest eigenvalue and trace), and perform loss surface perturbation analyses. Evaluate empirical inference efficiency.

Result: Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than dense baseline while avoiding expert collapse. SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE have similar curvature. All models achieve comparable generalization. Naive conditional routing doesn't yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale.

Conclusion: MoE architectures can improve accuracy in image classification with proper regularization, but show different sharpness characteristics without clear generalization benefits. The gap between theoretical and realized efficiency highlights that naive conditional routing doesn't provide practical speedups at small scales.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

### [216] [Factorizable joint shift revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15036)
*Dirk Tasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for analyzing distribution shift with general label spaces (beyond categorical), generalizing factorizable joint shift (FJS) and extending EM algorithms for class prior estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on factorizable joint shift (FJS) is limited to categorical label spaces, but many real-world problems involve continuous or general label spaces (including regression). There's a need to extend distribution shift analysis beyond classification to cover both classification and regression models.

Method: The authors develop a mathematical framework for analyzing distribution shift with general label spaces. They generalize existing FJS results to this broader context and propose an extension of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating class prior probabilities in this setting. They also re-examine generalized label shift (GLS) for general label spaces.

Result: The framework successfully extends distribution shift analysis to general label spaces, covering both classification and regression. The generalized FJS theory and extended EM algorithm provide tools for handling distribution shift in broader machine learning contexts beyond categorical classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between distribution shift analysis for classification and regression problems, providing a unified approach for handling factorizable joint shift and related concepts across general label spaces, with practical algorithmic extensions for model adaptation.

Abstract: Factorizable joint shift (FJS) was proposed as a type of distribution shift (or dataset shift) that comprises both covariate and label shift. Recently, it has been observed that FJS actually arises from consecutive label and covariate (or vice versa) shifts. Research into FJS so far has been confined to the case of categorical label spaces. We propose a framework for analysing distribution shift in the case of general label spaces, thus covering both classification and regression models. Based on the framework, we generalise existing results on FJS to general label spaces and propose a related extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for class prior probabilities. We also take a fresh look at generalized label shift (GLS) in the case of general label spaces.

*Mertcan Daysalilar,Fuat Uyguroglu,Gabriel Nicolosi,Adam Meyers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum-based DRL framework for EVRPTW achieves stable training and strong generalization by gradually increasing problem complexity through three learning phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL models for EVRPTW struggle with training instability and poor generalization when constraints are dense, failing to converge or maintain feasibility.

Method: Three-phase curriculum learning: Phase A (distance/fleet optimization), Phase B (battery management), Phase C (full EVRPTW). Uses modified PPO with phase-specific hyperparameters, value/advantage clipping, adaptive learning rates, and heterogeneous graph attention encoder with global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation.

Result: Model trained only on N=10 instances generalizes robustly to unseen instances (N=5 to N=100), outperforming baselines on medium-scale problems with high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances.

Conclusion: Curriculum-guided DRL effectively bridges the gap between neural speed and operational reliability, solving training instability in constrained optimization problems like EVRPTW.

Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.

TL;DR: HyNeA is a generative testing method that uses hypernetworks to efficiently control diffusion models for generating realistic failure cases to test deep learning systems, without needing failure-labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial attacks create unrealistic perturbations and only test robustness, not functional behavior. Existing generative testing methods are limited to simple datasets or constrained domains, while diffusion models are computationally expensive and lack controllability for large-scale testing.

Method: HyNeA uses hypernetworks to provide dataset-free controllability over diffusion-based generation, enabling targeted manipulation without architecture-specific conditioning or dataset-driven fine-tuning. It employs instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring failure-labeled datasets.

Result: HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators, generates realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods, and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

Conclusion: HyNeA enables efficient, targeted generation of realistic failure cases for systematic evaluation of deep learning systems, addressing limitations of traditional adversarial attacks and existing generative testing methods while overcoming computational and controllability constraints of diffusion models.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAP improves GNN quantization performance by injecting low-rank prompts into aggregated features during quantization-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN quantization reduces model size and accelerates inference for resource-constrained environments, but current methods have limitations in optimizing quantized aggregation results.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP) which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize quantized aggregation results during QAT.

Result: Extensive evaluations on 4 QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets show LoRAP consistently enhances low-bit quantized GNN performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: LoRAP effectively addresses limitations of feature-only prompting for GNN quantization, providing a practical solution for improving quantized GNN performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

*Oleg Shchendrigin,Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for testing continual memory updating in RL, finding that classic recurrent models outperform modern structured memories and transformers in memory rewriting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision-making requires memory that is both stable (retaining information long-term) and adaptive (updating outdated content). Current RL benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus mainly on retention, leaving memory rewriting largely unexplored despite its critical importance.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability. They compare three types of memory architectures: recurrent models, transformer-based memories, and structured memory architectures on this benchmark.

Result: Classic recurrent models demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories (which succeed only under narrow conditions) and transformer-based agents (which often fail beyond trivial retention cases).

Conclusion: Current approaches have fundamental limitations in balancing memory retention with adaptive updating. The work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and suggests designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

*Anmol Goel,Alan Ritter,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current machine unlearning methods fail to truly erase forgotten data, as information remains linearly decodable from model representations, revealing a critical privacy vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between apparent unlearning success and persistent information leakage in language models, exposing a critical limitation in current unlearning approaches.

Method: Introduce an interpretable information-theoretic framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to audit unlearning by comparing model representations before and after unlearning, decomposing mutual information into unlearned vs. residual knowledge components.

Result: Analysis reveals that redundant information shared across both models persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to adversarial reconstruction attacks, enabling a representation-based risk score for abstention on sensitive inputs.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning with theoretical insight and practical tools for safer language model deployment, highlighting the need for more effective unlearning methods.

Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

*Haonan Yuan,Qingyun Sun,Jiacheng Tao,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAG-GFM is a retrieval-augmented graph foundation model that externalizes knowledge from parameters to improve scalability, adaptability, and interpretability in graph learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) suffer from in-memory bottlenecks where knowledge is encoded into model parameters, limiting semantic capacity, causing lossy compression with conflicts, and entangling graph representation with knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, scalability, and interpretability.

Method: Proposes RAG-GFM with: 1) dual-modal unified retrieval module (semantic store from prefix-structured text and structural store from centrality-based motifs), 2) dual-view alignment objective to preserve heterogeneous information by contrasting both modalities, and 3) in-context augmentation for downstream adaptation using retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets show RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: RAG-GFM successfully addresses limitations of parameter-centric GFMs by externalizing knowledge through retrieval augmentation, enabling better scalability, adaptability, and performance across diverse graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

### [223] [DeepFedNAS: A Unified Framework for Principled, Hardware-Aware, and Predictor-Free Federated Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15127)
*Bostan Khan,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFedNAS introduces a two-phase framework for Federated Neural Architecture Search that optimizes supernet training using Pareto-optimal architectures and enables fast subnet discovery without accuracy predictors, achieving SOTA accuracy with 61x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FedNAS approaches suffer from unguided supernet training leading to suboptimal models, and require costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery, making hardware-aware FL deployments impractical.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training uses pre-computed Pareto-optimal architectures as curriculum to optimize supernet weights; 2) Predictor-Free Search Method uses multi-objective fitness function as direct accuracy proxy for on-demand subnet discovery.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (up to 1.21% improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter/communication efficiency, 61x speedup in total pipeline time, reducing from 20+ hours to ~20 minutes, with individual subnet searches in 20 seconds.

Conclusion: DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical by solving key bottlenecks in FedNAS through principled multi-objective optimization and efficient search methods.

Abstract: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

### [224] [CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141)
*Tianshi Xu,Yuteng Chen,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEANER is a method that uses LLMs' self-correction capabilities to purify noisy trajectories in agentic RL, improving policy optimization by replacing failures with successful self-corrections during data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-constrained LLMs (4B-7B) in agentic RL suffer from frequent execution failures during exploration, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Standard outcome-based rewards cause credit assignment issues where erroneous actions get reinforced alongside successes. Existing solutions face trade-offs: dense rewards lead to reward hacking, while supersampling is computationally expensive.

Method: CLEANER uses Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism that autonomously constructs clean trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. The model trains on these self-purified paths to internalize correct reasoning patterns.

Result: Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, demonstrating trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

Conclusion: CLEANER effectively addresses the credit assignment problem in agentic RL by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic self-correction capabilities to purify noisy trajectories. This approach enables more efficient policy optimization without the computational costs of supersampling or the risks of reward hacking, making it a scalable solution for parameter-constrained models.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

*Yuval Ran-Milo,Yotam Alexander,Shahar Mendel,Nadav Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained with sparse RL rewards can develop Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and this paper analyzes the gradient dynamics behind this emergence using a synthetic graph traversal task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism by which sparse outcome-based rewards drive Transformers to discover systematic Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which remains poorly understood despite empirical observations.

Method: Analyze gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that requires Chain-of-Thought. Prove theoretical convergence properties and characterize distributional requirements for emergence of interpretable algorithms.

Result: Despite training only on final-answer correctness, gradient flow converges to structured, interpretable iterative algorithms. Critical factor is sufficient mass on "simple examples" (instances requiring fewer reasoning steps) in training distribution.

Conclusion: The emergence of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from sparse rewards is driven by gradient dynamics that discover interpretable algorithms when training distributions include simpler instances, with theoretical findings validated on both synthetic and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

TL;DR: ZENITH optimizer adapts learning rate using gradient norm evolution, achieving better accuracy faster than baselines across vision tasks without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive optimizers have issues: computational/memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal learning rate choices. Manual learning rate scheduling requires oversight or hyperparameter tuning.

Method: ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) adapts learning rate using temporal evolution of gradient norm.

Result: Achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time across 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks for image classification. Also yields superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using R-CNN models.

Conclusion: ZENITH provides an effective adaptive learning rate method without computational overhead, compatible with regularization for better generalization across various computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

*Garrett G. Wen,Buxin Su,Natalie Collina,Zhun Deng,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Authors propose an author-assisted mechanism using the Isotonic Mechanism to elicit truthful author rankings of their own papers, which improves best paper award selection quality in large ML conferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML) receive tens of thousands of submissions, making best paper award selection challenging and increasingly debated. Current peer review processes struggle with quality and consistency for award selection.

Method: Uses Isotonic Mechanism to elicit authors' self-assessments as rankings, then adjusts raw review scores to optimally estimate ground-truth quality. Extends mechanism to handle overlapping authorship. Proves truthful reporting incentives under convex additive utility functions.

Result: Validated convexity assumption using ICLR (2019-2023) and NeurIPS (2021-2023) review data. Proved truthfulness holds even with nondecreasing additive utility for single-quota authors. Simulations show significant improvement in award selection quality.

Conclusion: Author-assisted mechanism effectively improves best paper award selection in large ML conferences by eliciting truthful author self-assessments and optimizing score adjustments, with practical extensions for real-world implementation.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

Conclusion: MolecularIQ provides a better evaluation framework for chemistry LLMs, guiding development of models that can reason faithfully over molecular structure by identifying specific failure modes and capability patterns.

Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.

*Junhyuk Heo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A self-supervised score-based generative model for SAR image despeckling that transforms data to log domain to convert multiplicative Gamma-distributed speckle into additive Gaussian noise, enabling efficient training and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery suffers from speckle noise that degrades image quality and complicates analysis. Existing despeckling methods face challenges due to the multiplicative and Gamma-distributed nature of SAR speckle, and many self-supervised techniques have long inference times.

Method: Transform SAR data into log domain to convert multiplicative Gamma-distributed speckle into approximately additive Gaussian noise residuals. Then apply score-based generative models trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective that learns from further corrupted versions of the input data itself.

Result: The method achieves significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques while providing robust SAR image restoration. The transformation enables effective application of score-based models to the challenging SAR speckle problem.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised score-based framework offers a practical and efficient solution for SAR image despeckling by transforming the problem domain to enable effective application of generative models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The speckle noise inherent in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery significantly degrades image quality and complicates subsequent analysis. Given that SAR speckle is multiplicative and Gamma-distributed, effectively despeckling SAR imagery remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework for SAR image despeckling based on score-based generative models operating in the transformed log domain. We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration.

Conclusion: LGANet++ demonstrates superior performance over existing methods and shows potential to support clinical workflows requiring reliable and efficient image registration. The framework addresses challenges in registering regions with high anatomical variability.

Abstract: Deformable image registration is a critical technology in medical image analysis, with broad applications in clinical practice such as disease diagnosis, multi-modal fusion, and surgical navigation. Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks.

TL;DR: Proposed PDANet with contour-weighted segmentation to address data imbalance in medical images, improving segmentation of small/underrepresented structures across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data imbalance issues where models bias toward larger/more frequent structures, overlooking smaller/less represented ones, affecting accuracy and robustness.

Method: Developed PDANet, a lightweight segmentation network based on partial decoder mechanism, with novel contour-weighted approach to improve representation of small/underrepresented structures.

Result: Outperformed nine SOTA methods on three datasets (abdominal organs, brain tumors, pelvic bone fragments), with contour-weighted strategy improving other methods by 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60% average Dice score enhancements.

Conclusion: Contour-weighted segmentation method surpasses current approaches in accuracy/robustness, is model-independent and can enhance various segmentation frameworks, showing practical importance for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Image segmentation is pivotal in medical image analysis, facilitating clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease evaluation. Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.

Experimental results on the Tsinghua DBS dataset (TT14) demonstrate that LiNUS achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.679 with an inference time of only 0.05 seconds per subject, significantly outperforming traditional manual and registration-based methods. Further validation on high-resolution data confirms the model's robustness, achieving a Dice score of 0.89. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) was also developed to facilitate real-time clinical application.

*K. Punnam Chandar,Y. Ravi Kumar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D STL models from 2D DICOM contours using filtering to remove segmentation outliers, improving geometric accuracy compared to unfiltered approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of low-resolution CT images often produces outliers in 2D contour data points, causing reconstructed 3D STL models to deviate from actual geometry. There's a need to handle these imperfections to create accurate 3D models for medical applications.

Method: Process CT images (contrast enhancement, noise reduction, smoothing), segment using thresholding, extract 2D contour points, filter outliers, apply Delaunay triangulation to filtered points for each layer, then join layers layer-by-layer to reconstruct 3D STL model.

Result: The method was validated on basic shapes and human pelvic bone ROI. 3D STL models reconstructed from filtered 2D data points showed improved geometry compared to models from unfiltered data points.

Conclusion: Filtering 2D contour data points before 3D reconstruction significantly improves the geometric accuracy of STL models, making the approach valuable for medical applications requiring precise 3D representations from CT scans.

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D Stereo-lithography (STL) Model from 2D Contours of scanned structure in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) images is crucial to understand the geometry and deformity. Computed Tomography (CT) images are processed to enhance the contrast, reduce the noise followed by smoothing. The processed CT images are segmented using thresholding technique. 2D contour data points are extracted from segmented CT images and are used to construct 3D STL Models. The 2D contour data points may contain outliers as a result of segmentation of low resolution images and the geometry of the constructed 3D structure deviate from the actual. To cope with the imperfections in segmentation process, in this work we propose to use filtered 2D contour data points to reconstruct 3D STL Model. The filtered 2D contour points of each image are delaunay triangulated and joined layer-by-layer to reconstruct the 3D STL model. The 3D STL Model reconstruction is verified on i) 2D Data points of basic shapes and ii) Region of Interest (ROI) of human pelvic bone and are presented as case studies. The 3D STL model constructed from 2D contour data points of ROI of segmented pelvic bone with and without filtering are presented. The 3D STL model reconstructed from filtered 2D data points improved the geometry of model compared to the model reconstructed without filtering 2D data points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase synchronization among distributed TRPs is essential for coherent joint transmission and high-precision sensing in mmWave cell-free massive MIMO systems, but existing methods have limitations in dynamic scenarios and overhead.

Method: Bidirectional calibration scheme with calibration coefficient estimation method, phase tracking using unilateral uplink/downlink CSI, and leveraging sensing results for dynamic scenario tracking through reciprocity calibration.

Result: Simulations show effective reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission and lower sensing error. Experimental results demonstrate OTA bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for TRPs and UEs with beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional calibration and phase tracking methods successfully enable phase synchronization for mmWave cell-free massive MIMO, achieving bidirectional empowerment of communication and sensing through reciprocity calibration and sensing feedback.

Abstract: Phase synchronization among distributed transmission reception points (TRPs) is a prerequisite for enabling coherent joint transmission and high-precision sensing in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper proposes a bidirectional calibration scheme and a calibration coefficient estimation method for phase synchronization, and presents a calibration coefficient phase tracking method using unilateral uplink/downlink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper introduces the use of reciprocity calibration to eliminate non-ideal factors in sensing and leverages sensing results to achieve calibration coefficient phase tracking in dynamic scenarios, thus enabling bidirectional empowerment of both communication and sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission, and resolving non-ideal factors to acquire lower sensing error in sensing applications. Experimental results show that, in the mmWave band, over-the-air (OTA) bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for both collaborative TRPs and collaborative user equipments (UEs), achieving beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing capabilities.

TL;DR: GPR-based channel estimation with novel spatial-correlation kernel achieves MMSE-optimal performance with 50% pilot reduction, lower complexity than conventional MMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead and computational complexity in multi-antenna systems, leveraging physics- and geometry-aware propagation models rather than purely statistical descriptions.

Method: Proposed Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework with novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures channel's second-order statistics. Derived closed-form expression for SC-based GPR estimator.

Result: Achieves lowest normalized mean-square error, highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior spectral efficiency preservation with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction. Maintains lower computational complexity than conventional MMSE estimator.

Conclusion: The proposed SC-based GPR estimator is MMSE-optimal under second-order statistics without requiring Gaussian channel distribution, offering practical advantages in pilot efficiency, accuracy, and computational complexity for multi-antenna systems.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead and computational complexity is key to efficiently utilizing multi-antenna wireless systems. Motivated by the evolution from purely statistical descriptions toward physics- and geometry-aware propagation models, this work focuses on incorporating channel information into a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework for improving the channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a GPR-based channel estimation framework along with a novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures the channel's second-order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression of the proposed SC-based GPR estimator and prove that its posterior mean is optimal in terms of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) under the same second-order statistics, without requiring the underlying channel distribution to be Gaussian. Our analysis reveals that, with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction, the proposed method achieves the lowest normalized mean-square error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior preservation of spectral efficiency compared to benchmark estimators, while maintaining lower computational complexity than the conventional MMSE estimator.

Conclusion: The ISCC framework represents a systemic paradigm that transcends traditional isolated designs, enabling improved overall performance for UAV swarms through tightly-coupled integration of sensing, communication, and control functions.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are pivotal in the applications such as disaster relief, aerial base station (BS) and logistics transportation. These scenarios require the capabilities in accurate sensing, efficient communication and flexible control for real-time and reliable task execution. However, sensing, communication and control are studied independently in traditional research, which limits the overall performance of UAV swarms. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a deeply coupled scheme of integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC) for UAV swarms, which is a systemic paradigm that transcends traditional isolated designs of sensing, communication and control by establishing a tightly-coupled closed-loop through the co-optimization of sensing, communication and control. In this article, we firstly analyze the requirements of scenarios and key performance metrics. Subsequently, the enabling technologies are proposed, including communication-and-control-enhanced sensing, sensing-and-control-enhanced communication, and sensing-and-communication-enhanced control.

TL;DR: Absorption mode data processing improves 2D mass spectrometry by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power for both proteomics and metabolomics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand absorption mode data processing to 2D mass spectra of any size and frequency range, overcoming previous limitations and improving analytical performance for complex biological samples.

Method: Applied absorption mode 2D MS with linear phase correction in precursor dimension and quadratic in fragment dimension to top-down analysis of oxidized ubiquitin proteoforms (from FPOP) and ergot alkaloid extracts.

Result: Absorption mode processing significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power compared to standard magnitude mode, leading to better sequence coverage in proteomics and more accurate precursor-fragment correlation in metabolomics.

Conclusion: Absorption mode data processing is a valuable enhancement for 2D MS that provides substantial analytical improvements for both proteomics and metabolomics applications, enabling better analysis of complex biological samples.

Abstract: Two-dimensional mass spectrometry (2D MS) is a method for tandem mass spectrometry that enables the correlation between precursor and fragment ions without the need for ion isolation. On a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer, the phase correction functions for absorption mode data processing were found to be linear in the precursor ion dimension and quadratic in the fragment ion dimension. Absorption mode data processing on limited data sets has previously shown improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power by a factor of 2. Here, we have expanded absorption mode data processing to 2D mass spectra regardless of size and frequency range. We have applied absorption mode 2D MS to top-down analysis of variously oxidized ubiquitin proteoforms generated by fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and to an extract of ergot alkaloids. We show that absorption mode data processing significantly improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of the 2D mass spectrum compared to standard magnitude mode in terms of sequence coverage in top-down proteomics, as well as the accuracy of precursor-fragment correlation in metabolomics.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a secured dual-functional radar-communication system using movable antennas to enhance communication security by maximizing achievable sum rate while satisfying radar performance and covertness constraints against multiple Willies (eavesdroppers).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movable antenna technology offers flexible channel reconfiguration, but securing dual-functional radar-communication systems against eavesdroppers (Willies) remains challenging. The paper aims to enhance communication security in such systems while maintaining radar performance.

Method: The authors develop a unified design framework with two approaches: 1) For non-colluding Willies, they use Lagrangian dual transformation, block coordinate descent with SDR, PGD, Dinkelbach transformation, and SCA; 2) For colluding Willies, they derive minimum detection error probability using generalized Erlang distribution and develop an MMSE-based algorithm.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method significantly improves covert sum rate and achieves superior balance between communication and radar performance compared to benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: Movable antennas can effectively enhance security in dual-functional radar-communication systems, with the proposed unified framework providing robust solutions for both non-colluding and colluding eavesdropper scenarios.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Analysis of sampling jitter effects on OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication systems, showing that state-of-the-art hardware provides sufficient robustness when RMS jitter is below 10^-11 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the impact of sampling jitter (SJ) on OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly for radar sensing performance which hasn't been thoroughly studied despite SJ being well-understood for communication-only OFDM systems.

Method: Analyzed SJ effects on OFDM-based ISAC systems considering both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies with different oversampling factors. Examined colored SJ from PLL-based oscillators and its impact on digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in single-input single-output systems with various OFDM parameterizations.

Result: SJ causes intercarrier interference (ICI) in BB sampling, and carrier phase error plus more severe ICI in BP sampling due to phase noise-like effects. Degradation becomes non-negligible only for RMS SJ values above 10^-11 seconds at both DAC and ADC (0.5*10^-2 times critical sampling period without oversampling).

Conclusion: State-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as femtosecond-range RMS SJ values can be achieved, making SJ-induced degradation negligible for practical ISAC implementations.

Abstract: To enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in cellular networks, a wide range of additional requirements and challenges are either imposed or become more critical. One such impairment is sampling jitter (SJ), which arises due to imperfections in the sampling instants of the clocks of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). While SJ is already well studied for communication systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is expected to be the waveform of choice for most sixth-generation (6G) scenarios where ISAC could be possible, the implications of SJ on the OFDM-based radar sensing must still be thoroughly analyzed. Considering that phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillators are used to derive sampling clocks, which leads to colored SJ, i.e., SJ with non-flat power spectral density, this article analyzes the resulting distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in OFDM-based ISAC for both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies and different oversampling factors. For BB sampling, it is seen that SJ induces intercarrier interference (ICI), while for BP sampling, it causes carrier phase error and more severe ICI due to a phase noise-like effect at the digital intermediate frequency. Obtained results for a single-input single-output OFDM-based ISAC system with various OFDM signal parameterizations demonstrate that SJ-induced degradation becomes non-negligible for both BB and BP sampling only for root mean square (RMS) SJ values above 10^-11 s at both DAC and ADC, which corresponds to 0.5*10^-2 times the considered critical sampling period without oversampling. Based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that state-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as RMS SJ values in the femtosecond range can be achieved.

TL;DR: DL-based CSI reconstruction framework using port-cycling to reduce overhead while maintaining accuracy for 6G systems


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future wireless systems with more transmit ports increase CSI estimation overhead, reducing data throughput despite improved spectral efficiency

Method: Port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different CSI port portions across time, plus CsiAdaNet model exploiting sparse measurements and capturing spatial-temporal correlations

Result: Achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems by balancing overhead reduction with accurate reconstruction

Abstract: Future wireless systems are expected to employ a substantially larger number of transmit ports for channel state information (CSI) estimation compared to current specifications. Although scaling ports improves spectral efficiency, it also increases the resource overhead to transmit reference signals across the time-frequency grid, ultimately reducing achievable data throughput. In this work, we propose an deep learning (DL)-based CSI reconstruction framework that serves as an enabler for reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems. The proposed solution involves designing a port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different portions of CSI ports across time, thereby lowering the overhead while preserving channel observability. The proposed CSI Adaptive Network (CsiAdaNet) model exploits the resulting sparse measurements and captures both spatial and temporal correlations to accurately reconstruct the full-port CSI. The simulation results show that our method achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical constellation designs like PSK and QAM lose optimality under realistic channels and hardware constraints, requiring better approaches that balance spectral efficiency, robustness, and energy consumption.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of multiple constellation types (classical, lattice-based, asymmetric, probabilistically shaped, Golden Angle, heuristic-optimized, and ML-assisted) using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations under AWGN and Rayleigh fading, incorporating PAPR-aware and power amplifier models.

Result: SER-optimal designs are not always energy-optimal; small trade-offs in SER can yield substantial energy savings. Machine learning approaches effectively optimize reliability, robustness, and energy efficiency jointly.

Conclusion: Constellation design requires holistic optimization considering both communication performance and hardware constraints, with machine learning offering promising flexible solutions for joint optimization of multiple objectives.

Abstract: Modulation constellation design is a core challenge in digital communications, especially under stringent demands on spectral efficiency, robustness, and energy consumption. Classical schemes like PSK and QAM, while analytically tractable, often lose optimality under realistic channels and nonlinear hardware constraints. This paper provides a unified study of constellation design from geometric, probabilistic, optimization, and machine learning perspectives, focusing on symbol error rate (SER), fading robustness, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and energy efficiency. We evaluate classical, lattice-based, asymmetric, probabilistically shaped, Golden Angle, heuristic-optimized, and machine learning assisted constellations under AWGN and Rayleigh fading via large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Incorporating PAPR-aware and power amplifier models reveals that SER-optimal designs are not always energy-optimal; small SER trade-offs can yield substantial energy savings. Machine learning approaches offer flexible joint optimization of reliability, robustness, and energy efficiency by embedding channel and hardware constraints into the learning objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive MIMO is crucial for 5G/6G but faces security challenges with passive eavesdroppers. Physical Layer Security offers promise but needs evaluation of different transmission strategies for secure communication when eavesdropper CSI is unknown.

Method: Extensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate three secure transmission schemes: Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Artificial Noise (AN)-aided beamforming. Performance assessed under varying system parameters (antenna count, SNR, power allocation).

Result: Comparative insights on strengths/limitations of different PLS strategies, including energy efficiency, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy sum rate metrics. Results highlight trade-offs between different beamforming approaches for secure massive MIMO.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for designing scalable, energy-efficient, and robust secure transmission techniques for future 6G networks, identifying open research directions for physical layer security in massive MIMO systems.

Abstract: Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) has become a crucial enabling technology for 5G and beyond, providing previously unheard-of increases in energy and spectrum efficiency. It is still difficult to guarantee secure communication in these systems, particularly when it comes to passive eavesdroppers whose base station is unaware of their channel state information. By taking advantage of the inherent randomness of wireless channels, Physical Layer Security (PLS) offers a promising paradigm; however, its efficacy in massive MIMO is heavily reliant on resource allocation and transmission strategies. In this work, the performance of secure transmission schemes, such as Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Artificial Noise (AN)-aided beamforming, is examined when passive eavesdroppers are present. This work will use extensive Monte Carlo simulations to assess important performance metrics such as energy efficiency, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy sum rate under different system parameters (e.g., number of antennas, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), power allocation). The results aim to provide comparative insight into the strengths and limitations of different PLS strategies and to highlight open research directions to design scalable, energy-efficient, and robust secure transmission techniques in future 6G networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Mobile EEG study shows reliable selective attention tracking in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios using scalp electrodes, with consistent above-chance classification accuracy across various attention conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neural attention tracking studies are limited to controlled lab settings with clean audio-only stimuli, lacking real-world applicability to dynamic, multisensory everyday communication involving shifting attention and overlapping speech/visual cues.

Method: Used mobile EEG system (44 scalp + 20 cEEGrid electrodes) with 24 normal-hearing participants in audiovisual paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to single talker, attention switching between talkers, and unscripted conversations with competing talker. Applied TRF modeling, optimal lag analysis, and selective attention classification with varying decision windows.

Result: Scalp EEG showed significant P2-peak differences between attended/ignored speech across conditions. No performance difference between switching/sustained attention suggests robustness. Conversation stimuli showed narrower optimal lag peaks. Selective attention classification achieved 55-70% accuracy for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid performed worse.

Conclusion: Mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios, providing guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications, though cEEGrid needs methodological improvements.

Abstract: Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.

TL;DR: Active sensing with sparse arrays offers improved resolution using fewer sensors by leveraging virtual arrays created through transmit-receive beamforming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active sensing applications (radar, sonar, wireless communications, medical ultrasound) require efficient sensor arrays that can focus and steer energy while minimizing hardware costs and complexity.

Method: Design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations using sum co-array concept, symmetric array framework extending passive geometries to active case, synthetic beamforming via image addition to mitigate side lobes, and physical beamforming weight optimization.

Result: Sparse arrays enable identification of more scatterers than physical sensors through virtual arrays, provide scalable symmetric array designs, and offer effective side lobe mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: Sparse arrays are valuable for active sensing applications, offering computational efficiency and hardware reduction while maintaining performance through innovative array design and beamforming techniques.

Abstract: This chapter focuses on active sensing using sparse arrays. In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing.

Result: Achieved classification accuracies of 99.38% for precipitation rate and 98.99% for wind speed. Estimation errors were 1.2 mm/h for precipitation rate and 1.5 km/h for wind speed.

Conclusion: Weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, expanding their service portfolio and increasing market value by leveraging existing infrastructure for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: One of the key features of sixth generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.

Motivation: High-mobility wireless networks need accurate target and beam tracking, especially for NLoS paths. Existing approaches struggle with tracking performance in dynamic environments with both LoS and NLoS conditions.

Method: Proposes CKM-assisted dual-domain tracking with EKF for coordinate domain tracking, beam transition models for beam domain tracking, and joint predictive beamforming with power allocation to minimize AoA estimation errors.

Result: Significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for NLoS path AoA tracking.

Conclusion: CKM effectively facilitates both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications by integrating dual-domain information and predictive optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.
