TL;DR: Fine-tuning ESA-IBM's TerraMind GFM on multimodal FloodsNet dataset improves flood mapping accuracy, with base-unfrozen model offering best balance of performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods are devastating global hazards, and while EO satellites provide critical data, operational flood mapping depends on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent GFMs offer improved generalizability but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.

Method: Fine-tuned TerraMind GFM for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet dataset (85 global flood events with co-located Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery). Tested four configurations: base vs. large models with frozen vs. unfrozen backbones. Compared against TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and U-Net trained on both datasets.

Result: Base-unfrozen configuration provided best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at lower computational cost. Large unfrozen model achieved highest recall. FloodsNet-trained models outperformed Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations but with slightly lower accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal optical/SAR data and fine-tuning GFMs can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale GFM evaluations for flood segmentation, highlighting both potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function with two convergence targets to address information distortion in contrastive learning, improving both generalization performance and convergence speed across 8 benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning can introduce information distortion where models over-rely on samples with identical labels while neglecting positive pairs from the same original image, especially in large datasets.

Method: A context-enriched contrastive loss function with two components: (1) label-sensitive component that differentiates features of identical vs. distinct classes to boost training efficiency, and (2) a component that draws closer augmented samples from the same source image while distancing all other samples.

Result: Achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in generalization performance and convergence speed across 8 benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, CelebA). Shows 22.9% improvement on BiasedMNIST dataset compared to original contrastive loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses information distortion in contrastive learning, demonstrating promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training, particularly in handling systematic distortion tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint evaluation framework for text-to-image models and vision-language models by testing VLMs' ability to identify 27 specific failure modes in T2I-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in prompts (like object counts and colors), while VLM benchmarks haven't kept pace with the complexity of scenes they need to annotate. Existing metrics are insufficient to capture nuanced errors in generative models.

Method: Develops a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in images generated by T2I models from challenging prompts. Creates a dataset with prompts, images from 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3 variants), and corresponding VLM annotations (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) verified by LLM (Llama3).

Result: Analysis reveals systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation across T2I models. Shows that current metrics fail to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the need for targeted benchmarks.

Conclusion: Targeted benchmarks are crucial for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability. The proposed joint evaluation framework provides a more comprehensive assessment of both T2I model performance and VLM annotation capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLOST: A dual variational autoencoder model that predicts somatic mutation profiles from medical images using point cloud representations and shared latent space with normalizing flow priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early cancer diagnosis and treatment are crucial for efficacy. Medical imaging is used initially, followed by genetic information for treatment selection. The paper aims to bridge these domains by predicting somatic mutations directly from medical images to enable earlier genetic insights.

Method: 1) Convert lesion images to point cloud representations for modality invariance. 2) LLOST model with dual variational autoencoders for lesion point clouds and somatic mutation counts. 3) Three latent spaces coupled by shared latent space. 4) Conditional normalizing flow priors for each domain to handle diverse distributions.

Result: Model shows predictive performance on counts of specific mutations and accurately predicts mutation occurrence. Identifies shared patterns between imaging and somatic mutation domains that reflect cancer type. Experiments conducted on TCIA medical images and Pan Cancer dataset somatic mutations.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges imaging and genetic domains for cancer diagnosis. Future work includes model improvements and extending to other genetic domains beyond somatic mutations.

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02268)
*Jeremy Andrew Irvin,Jiaqi Han,Zikui Wang,Abdulaziz Alharbi,Yufei Zhao,Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan,Daniele Visioni,Andrew Y. Ng,Duncan Watson-Parris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPF is a new flow matching approach for climate emulation that uses spatiotemporal pyramids to enable efficient, parallel generation across multiple timescales, outperforming baselines on ClimateBench and scaling with the new ClimateSuite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative approaches for climate emulation rely on slow weather-scale autoregression that struggles with long climate horizons and nonstationary forcings, limiting practical climate modeling applications.

Method: Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF) partition the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution while coupling each stage with specific timescales to enable direct sampling at any temporal level, with conditioning on physical forcings.

Result: SPF outperforms flow matching baselines and pre-trained models on ClimateBench at yearly and monthly timescales with fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. The scaled model using ClimateSuite (33,000+ simulation-years) shows good generalization to held-out scenarios.

Conclusion: SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios, enabling transformative climate modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

### [6] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution only to undersampled regions using camera pose and geometry information, producing sharper and more consistent 3DGS renders than uniform SR approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard super-resolution applied uniformly to all views introduces multi-view inconsistencies in 3D Gaussian Splatting, leading to blurry renders. Existing methods don't account for which regions actually need SR enhancement based on available high-frequency information across different views.

Method: SplatSuRe uses camera pose relative to scene geometry to identify undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision. It selectively applies super-resolution only to these regions rather than uniformly across all images, leveraging that close-up views may contain high-frequency information for regions captured in distant views.

Result: The method outperforms baselines on Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

Conclusion: Selective super-resolution based on camera geometry and available high-frequency information yields superior results compared to uniform SR application, addressing multi-view inconsistency issues in 3DGS rendering.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [7] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSurg improves surgical scene segmentation generalization across centers and modalities by exploiting style-content separation with instance normalization, feature covariance mapping, and a restitution module to retain task-relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical scene segmentation methods fail to generalize to unseen distributions (different centers) and modalities. While OOD generalization methods exist for natural scenes, they don't work for surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and extreme diversity. The paper aims to address generalization gaps in surgical scene segmentation.

Method: 1) Exploit style and content information using instance normalization and feature covariance mapping for robust feature representations. 2) Introduce a restitution module within ResNet backbone to retain useful task-relevant features that might be lost during normalization. 3) Provide a newly curated multiclass, multicentre dataset for surgical scene segmentation.

Result: RobustSurg achieved ~23% improvement over baseline DeepLabv3+ and 10-32% improvement over SOTA on unseen HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. On EndoUDA polyp dataset, it achieved ~22% improvement over baseline and ~11% improvement over recent SOTA.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in surgical scene segmentation by separating style and content features while preserving task-relevant information, demonstrating significant improvements on unseen distributions and modalities.

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [8] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces multifractal recalibration methods for deep learning, showing they outperform other channel-attention mechanisms in medical image segmentation tasks using U-Net architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multifractal analysis is underutilized in deep learning despite its proven ability to capture regularities in self-seeding phenomena. Existing methods rely on heavy pooling or feature-space decimation that constrain tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Introduces two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These leverage relationships between probability mass of exponents and multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks using a U-Net framework.

Result: Multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over baselines with other channel-attention mechanisms that use higher-order statistics. Validated on three medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).

Conclusion: Multifractal recalibration is effective for medical image segmentation. Insights reveal that excitation responses don't become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net due to skip connections, and their effectiveness relates to global statistics of instance variability.

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [9] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified-VQA is a diagnostic mixture-of-experts framework for video quality assessment that provides both global quality scores and interpretable artifact vectors across multiple video formats without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods are monolithic, provide single scores without diagnostic feedback, and are format-specific rather than truly generic solutions that work across different perceptual domains.

Method: Proposes Unified-VQA framework with multiple perceptual experts for distinct domains, using multi-proxy expert training with ranking-inspired loss, and diagnostic multi-task head for global scores and artifact vectors via weakly-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection across 17 databases with HD, UHD, HDR, HFR formats, using static parameters without retraining.

Conclusion: Represents an important step toward practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment by unifying multiple formats and providing diagnostic feedback.

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on fine-grained speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos, focusing on who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech, often being visually solvable or only coarsely evaluating speech, limiting insight into models' ability to align speakers, content, and timing.

Method: Created AV-SpeakerBench with 3,212 multiple-choice questions featuring: (1) speaker-centered formulation treating speakers as core reasoning units, (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies, and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity.

Result: Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems, highlighting current limitations in audiovisual fusion capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron for SNN-based image deraining, achieving SOTA performance with 87% less energy than existing SNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are biologically plausible and energy-efficient but under-explored for low-level vision tasks like image deraining. Traditional spiking neurons lack spatial contextual understanding and have frequency-domain saturation limitations.

Method: Introduces Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron to overcome spatial context limitations. Uses VLIF to create Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods across five benchmark datasets while using only 13% of their energy consumption.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks, demonstrating practical viability of SNNs for real-world applications.

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by generating restoration trajectories instead of natural motion, achieving improved perceptual metrics and zero-shot generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models have strong temporal generation capabilities but their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. The authors aim to repurpose these models for progressive visual restoration tasks.

Method: Fine-tune CogVideo to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement with gradual transitions from degraded to clean frames. Compare two prompting strategies: uniform text prompt vs. scene-specific prompting using LLaVA multi-modal LLM refined with ChatGPT.

Result: The fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) across frames. It effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. The model generalizes to real-world scenarios on ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness.

Conclusion: CogVideo can be successfully repurposed for progressive visual restoration tasks, learning restoration trajectories that improve image quality over time while maintaining temporal coherence, with strong generalization to real-world scenarios without additional training.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

TL;DR: MORP-Synth improves SAR oil spill segmentation transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian coast using synthetic data augmentation with morphological perturbation and texture generation.


<details>

Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, especially problematic for Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data is scarce.

Method: Two-stage synthetic augmentation framework: Stage A applies Morphological Region Perturbation (curvature-guided label space method) to generate realistic geometric variations; Stage B renders SAR-like textures from edited masks using conditional generative INADE model.

Result: Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8% to 51.8% mIoU on Peruvian domain; MORP-Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Conclusion: MORP-Synth effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges for SAR oil spill segmentation, improving model generalization from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions through synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

*Chenshuang Zhang,Kang Zhang,Joon Son Chung,In So Kweon,Junmo Kim,Chengzhi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised tracker using video diffusion models' motion representations outperforms existing methods on visually similar object tracking by 6 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised trackers struggle with visually similar objects when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting scalability without extensive labeled data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained video diffusion models that inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking, as their denoising process isolates motion in early high-noise stages separate from appearance refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and new tests for tracking visually similar items. Enables robust tracking of identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models provide effective motion representations for self-supervised tracking, particularly for distinguishing visually similar objects where existing methods fail.

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

TL;DR: TALO: A plug-and-play framework for temporal alignment of 3D vision foundation model predictions using Thin Plate Spline with globally propagated control points for long-term consistency in online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D vision foundation models show strong generalization but struggle with temporal consistency in online settings like driving scenarios. Existing alignment methods have limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness to noisy geometry.

Method: Proposes a higher-DOF alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline with globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. Uses point-agnostic submap registration design for robustness to noisy geometry predictions. Fully plug-and-play and compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups (monocular or surround-view).

Conclusion: The proposed TALO framework demonstrates robust and general temporal alignment capabilities for 3D vision foundation models in online deployment scenarios, with publicly available code.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

TL;DR: Proposes MS-CAM, a visual explanation method for CNNs in SAR applications that combines channel-wise and element-wise weights to improve interpretability and enable weakly-supervised object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN opacity hinders high-reliability requirements in SAR applications, limiting their deployment. Improving interpretability is crucial for SAR development.

Method: Multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) matches SAR images with CNN feature maps and gradients, combining channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize decision basis.

Result: MS-CAM more accurately highlights network's regions of interest and captures detailed target features, enhancing interpretability. Validated for weakly-supervised object localization with analysis of key factors like pixel thresholds.

Conclusion: MS-CAM improves CNN interpretability for SAR applications, enabling better understanding of model decisions and supporting weakly-supervised localization tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

*Shwai He,Chaorui Deng,Ang Li,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inefficiencies in unified multimodal models, finds generation components are sensitive to compression, and proposes MoE adaptation to enable sparse activation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models integrating both understanding and generation capabilities suffer from inference inefficiencies, as specific tasks or samples may not require the full model capacity. There's limited systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis using training-free pruning as probing methodology (depth pruning and width reduction). 2) Proposed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation that partitions generation module into multiple experts with sparse activation. 3) Validated through expert-frozen tuning and fully trainable adaptation.

Result: Understanding components show notable compressibility, especially in generation tasks. Generation components are highly sensitive to compression. MoE adaptation enables BAGEL model to achieve comparable performance to full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE adaptation effectively addresses inefficiencies in unified multimodal models by enabling sparse activation of generation components, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

*Bin Li,Daijie Chen,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSCF-MVCC: A weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method that uses only crowd counts (not density maps) as supervision, with self-supervised ranking loss and semantic matching for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view crowd counting methods require expensive camera calibrations and crowd annotations (density maps or image-level counts). There's a need for more practical, cost-effective approaches that minimize annotation requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes WSCF-MVCC with: 1) Weak supervision using only crowd counts instead of density maps for single-view counting module; 2) Self-supervised ranking loss with multi-scale priors to enhance perceptual ability without extra annotations; 3) Semantic information utilization for more accurate view matching and scene-level estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, demonstrating superior practical deployment suitability compared to calibrated methods.

Conclusion: WSCF-MVCC provides an effective calibration-free multi-view crowd counting solution with minimal annotation requirements, making it more suitable for practical real-world deployment than existing methods that need costly calibrations and annotations.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

TL;DR: VACoT is a framework that dynamically applies image augmentations during VLM inference to improve robustness on challenging inputs, especially OCR-related adversarial scenarios, without requiring expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs rely heavily on large-scale real data or synthetic diversity but struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle well. Retraining VLMs on augmented data is costly and yields diminishing returns, creating a need for inference-time augmentation approaches.

Method: VACoT dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference using a structured collection of general visual augmentations. It employs efficient agentic reinforcement learning with a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentations while penalizing verbose responses.

Result: VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. It demonstrates superiority on 13 perception benchmarks and introduces AdvOCR to highlight generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations.

Conclusion: VACoT provides an effective framework for improving VLM robustness through inference-time visual augmentations, addressing limitations of traditional training approaches while reducing computational overhead and maintaining concise reasoning.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TB diagnostic methods like sputum smear microscopy and culture are inefficient, especially in resource-limited settings, creating a need for automated, accessible diagnostic tools using advanced technologies like deep learning.

Method: Used a Kaggle dataset of 4,200 chest X-rays, applied data splitting, augmentation, and resizing for preprocessing. Compared pretrained ResNet-50 and general SqueezeNet models, evaluating performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix metrics.

Result: SqueezeNet significantly outperformed ResNet-50: SqueezeNet achieved 89% accuracy, 98% precision, 80% recall, 87% F1 score with 32% loss, while ResNet-50 achieved only 73% accuracy, 88% precision, 52% recall, 65% F1 score with 54% loss.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows strong potential for TB detection, with SqueezeNet demonstrating superior performance. Integration into mobile devices could expand accessibility in resource-limited areas, but continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate models is needed to combat TB globally.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Conclusion: The proposed map-free trajectory prediction algorithm successfully addresses efficiency and accuracy challenges in complex interactive scenarios by adaptively selecting critical information across multiple domains and filtering redundancies, showing promising results for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

*Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Peifeng Zhang,Haohuan Fu,Juepeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a style-adaptive generalization framework that synthesizes visual prompts to improve domain generalization for semantic segmentation without modifying frozen model parameters, addressing privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world scenarios, model parameters and architectural details are often inaccessible due to privacy and security constraints, preventing traditional fine-tuning. There's a need for input-level strategies that enhance generalization without modifying model weights.

Method: SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles. It first uses style transfer to construct diverse style representations from the source domain, then adaptively fuses these style cues based on each input's visual context to create dynamic prompts that harmonize image appearance without touching the model interior.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints, and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and unseen domain diversity through a closed-loop design that synthesizes adaptive visual prompts, providing a practical solution for domain generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time UAV photogrammetry is crucial for time-critical applications like disaster response and digital-twin maintenance, but existing methods lack quality evaluation and guided feedback for image acquisition optimization.

Method: On-the-fly Feedback SfM framework with three modules: 1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation from sparse point clouds, 2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators, and 3) predictive path planning for trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time, significantly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs through actionable feedback, enabling intelligent adaptive exploration workflows.

Conclusion: The framework enables transition from traditional passive photogrammetry to intelligent adaptive exploration by integrating data collection, processing, reconstruction, assessment, and online feedback in real-time UAV operations.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDTA introduces a feature refinement framework with three adapters (spatial, temporal, identity) to enhance object discriminativeness in end-to-end MOT, addressing low association accuracy caused by high inter-object similarity in DETR-based embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end MOT methods using DETR architecture suffer from low association accuracy due to excessively high inter-object similarity. These methods focus on category-level discrimination within single frames, but tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity.

Method: FDTA (From Detection to Association) introduces three complementary adapters: 1) Spatial Adapter (SA) integrates depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, 2) Temporal Adapter (TA) aggregates historical information for temporal dependencies, and 3) Identity Adapter (IA) uses quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability.

Result: FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, demonstrating the effectiveness of the discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed FDTA framework successfully addresses the association accuracy limitation in end-to-end MOT by enhancing object discriminativeness through complementary spatial, temporal, and identity perspectives, leading to improved tracking performance.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Motivation: Despite 4D radar's potential for robust perception in adverse conditions, radar semantic segmentation research is limited by scarce open-source datasets and labels. Existing datasets like RaDelft only provide LiDAR annotations with no public code for radar label generation, hindering reproducibility and downstream research.

Method: The authors develop a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline that projects radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation results and applies spatial clustering to generate accurate radar labels without human annotation.

Result: The method reproduces RaDelft's numerical results and generates labels that significantly enhance radar labeling accuracy. It establishes a reproducible framework for training and evaluating labeled 4D radar data, and quantifies how different fog levels affect radar labeling performance.

Conclusion: The camera-guided radar labeling pipeline provides an effective solution to the radar dataset scarcity problem, enabling reproducible research and advancing 4D radar semantic segmentation without reliance on human annotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal agentic systems treat image manipulation and web search as separate capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces.

Method: Developed a 30B parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and interleaved reasoning. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories with stepwise consistency filtering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: Sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: Nav-R² is a framework for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation that uses structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Similarity-Aware Memory to improve decision-making and success rates for locating unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-goal navigation approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rates when locating unseen objects in open-vocabulary settings.

Method: Explicitly models target-environment relationships and environment-action planning through structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning, combined with a Similarity-Aware Memory that preserves target-relevant and observation-relevant features from temporal and semantic perspectives without adding parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects, avoids overfitting to seen object categories, and maintains real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: Nav-R² provides a streamlined, efficient pipeline for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation with transparent reasoning and improved performance on novel objects.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

*Anoop Cherian,River Doyle,Eyal Ben-Dov,Suhas Lohit,Kuan-Chuan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE is a multi-agent debate framework for multimodal reasoning that uses heterogeneous experts (Solvers and Reflectors) with a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for solution aggregation, achieving 2-7% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has shown promise for leveraging complementary strengths of LLMs, but its application has been limited to language-only tasks, leaving multimodal reasoning problems underexplored. The authors aim to extend MAD to vision-and-language reasoning by developing a framework that can handle heterogeneous experts with different capabilities.

Method: WISE (Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts) partitions agents into Solvers (generate solutions) and Reflectors (verify correctness, assign weights, provide feedback). It uses a two-stage debate model with a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for aggregating solutions across rounds, accounting for response variance and feedback weights.

Result: WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks (SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and new SMART-840++) and various LLM configurations.

Conclusion: The WISE framework successfully extends multi-agent debate to multimodal reasoning problems, demonstrating that heterogeneous expert agents with specialized roles (Solvers and Reflectors) can effectively collaborate to improve reasoning accuracy across diverse vision-and-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MitUNet is a hybrid neural network for precise wall segmentation in floor plans, combining Mix-Transformer encoder with U-Net decoder and Tversky loss optimization to improve boundary accuracy and thin structure detection for 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wall segmentation methods for floor plans struggle with detecting thin structural components and produce masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision needed for subsequent vectorization in 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Method: MitUNet uses a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for boundary recovery. It employs Tversky loss optimization with fine-tuned hyperparameters to balance precision and recall, suppressing false positives while maintaining sensitivity to thin structures.

Result: Experiments on the CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset show that MitUNet generates structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

Conclusion: MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines by addressing the specific challenges of wall segmentation in floor plans.

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

*Xinyao Li,Yinjie Min,Hongbo Chen,Zhekai Du,Fengling Li,Jingjing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GuiDG, a domain-expert-guided framework for vision-language model fine-tuning that improves domain generalization by training multiple domain experts instead of a single universal model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for vision-language models face a trade-off between domain specificity and generalization ability. Fine-tuning a universal model on entire datasets compromises generalization to unseen domains, creating a need for better approaches that maintain both domain adaptation and generalization capabilities.

Method: Two-step GuiDG framework: 1) Uses prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts from partitioned domains, 2) Introduces Cross-Modal Attention module to guide vision encoder fine-tuning through adaptive expert integration. Also constructs ImageNet-DG benchmark for few-shot domain generalization evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and the new ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency, validating the theoretical insight that multiple domain experts generalize better than a single universal model.

Conclusion: Training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better domain generalization than fine-tuning a universal model, and the proposed GuiDG framework effectively implements this insight with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: GUI Exploration Lab: A simulation environment for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible screen composition and full environment access, showing that supervised fine-tuning + reinforcement learning improves navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world GUI environments (PC software, mobile apps) are complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation, which hinders systematic investigation of agent navigation capabilities.

Method: Introduce GUI Exploration Lab - a simulation environment engine that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs while providing full access to environment information. Use three-stage training: 1) supervised fine-tuning for memorization, 2) single-turn reinforcement learning for generalization, 3) multi-turn reinforcement learning for exploration strategies.

Result: Supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, single-turn RL enhances generalization to unseen scenarios, and multi-turn RL encourages exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to improved screen navigation performance. Methods validated on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating generalization to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approaches show advantages in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents. The GUI Exploration Lab enables comprehensive agent training and evaluation that was previously limited by proprietary real-world environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

*Woongyeong Yeo,Kangsan Kim,Jaehong Yoon,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldMM is a multimodal memory agent for long video understanding that uses three complementary memory types (episodic, semantic, visual) with adaptive retrieval across multiple temporal scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long video QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video LLMs struggle with hours- or days-long videos due to limited context capacity and loss of visual details. Current memory-augmented methods rely too heavily on textual summaries and fixed temporal scales, failing to utilize visual evidence and handle events with variable durations.

Method: WorldMM constructs three complementary memory types: episodic memory (factual events across multiple temporal scales), semantic memory (continuously updated high-level conceptual knowledge), and visual memory (detailed scene information). An adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects relevant memory sources and temporal granularities based on queries.

Result: WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WorldMM demonstrates effective long video reasoning through its multimodal memory architecture with adaptive retrieval, addressing limitations of text-heavy approaches and fixed temporal scales in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

TL;DR: LightHCG is a lightweight causal representation learning model for glaucoma detection that achieves high performance with 93-99% fewer parameters than existing vision models while enabling AI-driven intervention analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches have limitations in reliability, excessive parameter usage, potential spurious correlations, and lack of capability for intervention analysis or clinical simulations.

Method: LightHCG uses a Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model with HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised causal representation learning to capture true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors.

Result: The model achieves high glaucoma classification performance with 93-99% less weights compared to advanced vision models like InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, while enhancing potential for AI-driven intervention analysis.

Conclusion: LightHCG represents a novel causal representation approach that addresses key limitations of current AI glaucoma detection methods by being lightweight, reliable, and enabling clinical intervention analysis.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

TL;DR: Proposes momentum self-distillation method for efficient vision-language model training in healthcare, achieving competitive performance with single GPU while reducing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical healthcare faces challenges in obtaining detailed annotations, requiring robust VLMs. Contrastive learning for VLMs needs large batch sizes, making it computationally demanding and limiting accessibility. With limited healthcare data, knowledge extraction from both data and models is crucial for performance improvement.

Method: Leverages momentum method combined with distillation: (1) momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integration of momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge effective batch size without increasing resource consumption.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with SOTA in zero-shot classification, substantial boost in few-shot adaptation (over 90% AUC-ROC), improves retrieval tasks by 2-3%, and maintains high training efficiency with single GPU and reasonable training time.

Conclusion: The approach advances efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods, making VLM training more accessible for healthcare applications with limited computational resources.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

TL;DR: BOLT extracts orthogonal spectral bases from existing fine-tuned models and adapts within that subspace for efficient transfer to new tasks with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches face challenges: meta-learning requires expensive meta-training, while the growing number of task-specific pre-trained models lacks efficient transfer methods with minimal additional training.

Method: Two-phase approach: offline phase extracts dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases; online phase freezes these bases and trains only small diagonal coefficients per layer for new tasks.

Result: BOLT provides strong training-free initialization for unseen tasks and achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines and meta-learned initialization with very few trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace offers an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer, leveraging existing models without weight merging.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

*Fan Luo,Zeyu Gao,Xinhao Luo,Kai Zhao,Yanfeng Lu*

TL;DR: TDE enhances SNNs for object detection by generating diverse temporal inputs and using spike-driven attention to reduce energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNNs have limited expressive power because they replicate or aggregate inputs at fixed intervals, leading to nearly identical stimuli across time steps, which is particularly problematic for complex tasks like object detection.

Method: Proposes Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) with two modules: Spiking Encoder (SE) generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and Attention Gating Module (AGM) guides SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Also introduces Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to eliminate high-energy multiplication operations from AGM.

Result: TDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on PASCAL VOC and 47.6% on EvDET200K. SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Conclusion: TDE effectively enhances SNNs' temporal modeling capacity for object detection while maintaining energy efficiency through spike-driven attention, making it a promising approach for energy-efficient visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: To document the creation and technical details of the influential nuScenes dataset that have not been previously published, and to analyze its impact on autonomous driving research and subsequent datasets in the field.

Method: The authors conduct a retrospective analysis of nuScenes, including its extensions (nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes), examining technical specifications, data collection processes, and comparing it with other datasets. They trace its influence on subsequent datasets and review methodological developments in autonomous driving research using nuScenes.

Result: The paper reveals previously unpublished technical details about nuScenes' creation, demonstrates its pioneering role as the first dataset with radar data, diverse urban scenes from two continents, and collected using fully autonomous vehicles. It shows how nuScenes established numerous community standards and influenced many subsequent autonomous driving datasets.

Conclusion: nuScenes has been a foundational dataset that revolutionized autonomous driving research by setting new standards for multi-modal sensor fusion, diverse data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, with lasting impact on the field's development and methodology.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseLayout3D is a new real-world benchmark for full building-scale 3D layout estimation, addressing limitations of current models that only handle single rooms/floors and lack global spatial context for multi-floor structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D layout estimation models are trained on synthetic datasets with simple single-room/single-floor environments, making them unable to handle large multi-floor buildings. They require scene splitting which removes essential global spatial context for reasoning about connecting structures like staircases.

Method: The authors introduce HouseLayout3D benchmark and present MultiFloor3D, a simple training-free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods. MultiFloor3D doesn't require additional training and builds upon existing techniques.

Result: MultiFloor3D already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both the new HouseLayout3D benchmark and prior datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach and highlighting the need for further research in full building-scale layout estimation.

Conclusion: The work addresses a significant gap in 3D layout estimation by providing a real-world benchmark for multi-floor buildings and showing that even a simple training-free baseline can outperform existing methods, indicating substantial room for improvement in this research direction.

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

*Kerui Chen,Jianrong Zhang,Ming Li,Zhonglong Zheng,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClusterStyle: A clustering-based framework for stylized motion generation that captures intra-style diversity using prototype-based structured embeddings at global and local levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stylized motion generation models fail to capture intra-style diversity - the ability to generate diverse motion variations within a single style category. Current approaches learn unstructured embeddings that don't effectively model the rich variations within a style.

Method: Proposes ClusterStyle with two key components: 1) Uses prototypes to model diverse style patterns across motions of the same category, 2) Captures both global-level diversity among style motions and local-level diversity within temporal dynamics, creating structured global and local embedding spaces aligned with non-learnable prototype anchors. Also introduces Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate style features into pretrained text-to-motion models.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both stylized motion generation and motion style transfer tasks.

Conclusion: ClusterStyle effectively addresses the limitation of capturing intra-style diversity in motion generation by using prototype-based structured embeddings, demonstrating superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

TL;DR: STL is a self-training framework that enhances VLMs' multimodal reasoning by using structured "see-before-think" templates and negative rationales, outperforming baselines without costly human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with effective multimodal reasoning due to weaknesses in either perception or reasoning. Existing methods to improve reasoning rely on expensive human annotations, proprietary models, or self-training that ignores perception, creating a need for cost-effective solutions.

Method: STL introduces a structured reasoning template that forces models to first extract visual attributes in textual form ("see") before using them for reasoning ("think"). The framework uses self-training where models generate and learn from their own structured rationales, augmented with negative rationales that explain why wrong answers are incorrect.

Result: Experiments across diverse domains show STL consistently outperforms baselines trained only on answers or self-generated reasoning. Qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales.

Conclusion: STL provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning in VLMs by jointly improving perception and reasoning through structured self-training with negative rationales.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

*Jianzong Wu,Hao Lian,Dachao Hao,Ye Tian,Qingyu Shi,Biaolong Chen,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Audio-video joint denoising training improves video generation quality even when only video quality matters, by using audio as a privileged signal to learn physical causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether audio-video joint denoising training can improve video generation quality beyond just achieving audio-video synchrony, even when the primary goal is video quality alone.

Method: Introduced AVFullDiT, a parameter-efficient architecture leveraging pre-trained T2V and T2A modules for joint denoising. Trained both T2AV (audio-video) and T2V-only models under identical settings for comparison.

Result: Audio-video joint denoising consistently improves video quality, especially on challenging subsets with large motions and object contacts. Audio acts as a privileged signal that helps the model learn causal relationships between visual events and acoustic consequences.

Conclusion: Cross-modal co-training (audio-video joint denoising) is a promising approach for developing stronger, more physically grounded world models, providing benefits beyond just synchrony to improve video generation quality itself.

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-Bench introduces a sequential embodied AI benchmark for real-world sequential tasks, and 3DSPMR is a novel approach that incorporates 3D spatial memory with geometric cues into MLLMs for improved reasoning and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world embodied agents face sequential tasks where sub-tasks build on previous ones, requiring reuse of spatial knowledge from prior explorations. Current research focuses on single-task settings, leaving sequential embodied tasks underexplored despite their practical significance.

Method: Proposes 3DSPMR (3D Spatial Memory Reasoning) that augments Multi-Modal Large Language Models with relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions. This is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding for sequential embodied tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN) tasks in the SEER-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The work addresses the important challenge of sequential embodied AI by introducing a new benchmark and demonstrating that incorporating 3D geometric information into MLLMs significantly improves performance on sequential exploration and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

TL;DR: TGDD improves dataset distillation by dynamically aligning synthetic and original data distributions along the model's training trajectory, achieving 5.0% accuracy gains on high-resolution benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distribution matching (DM)-based dataset distillation methods overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits synthetic data expressiveness and weakens downstream performance.

Method: TGDD reformulates distribution matching as dynamic alignment along the model's training trajectory, capturing evolving semantics at each stage while introducing distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap.

Result: TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten datasets with 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks, maintaining favorable balance between performance and efficiency without additional optimization overhead.

Conclusion: TGDD effectively preserves semantic diversity and representativeness in synthetic data through trajectory-guided dynamic alignment, significantly improving downstream task performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with temporally- and spatially-consistent long-term world modeling due to prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs.

Method: WorldPack uses efficient compressed memory with two components: trajectory packing for high context efficiency, and memory retrieval to maintain consistency in rollouts and support spatial reasoning for long-term generations.

Result: WorldPack significantly outperforms strong state-of-the-art models on the LoopNav benchmark in Minecraft, demonstrating notable improvements in spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation.

Conclusion: WorldPack's compressed memory approach effectively addresses the computational challenges of long-context video world modeling while improving spatial consistency and generation quality for long-term predictions.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCAgents is a hierarchical multi-agent framework for medical VQA that enforces unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models in medical diagnosis suffer from reasoning detachment where explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Existing multi-agent frameworks for MDT debates amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence.

Method: UCAgents uses a hierarchical multi-agent framework inspired by clinical workflows, forbidding position changes and limiting agent interactions to targeted evidence verification. It introduces one-round inquiry discussions to uncover visual-textual misalignment risks, constraining both visual ambiguity and textual noise through a dual-noise bottleneck formalized via information theory.

Result: UCAgents achieves 71.3% accuracy on PathVQA (+6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost. It strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference, demonstrating both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: UCAgents effectively addresses reasoning detachment in medical VLMs by enforcing evidence-based convergence, making it suitable for real-world clinical deployment due to its combination of diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D-SLIM replaces causal attention masks with adaptive spatial masks for better 3D scene-language reasoning, eliminating sequential bias and improving object-instruction attention without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use standard LLM decoders with causal attention masks, which create two problems: 1) sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects, and 2) restricted object-instruction attention that hinders task-specific reasoning.

Method: Proposes 3D-SLIM (3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask) with two components: Geometry-adaptive Mask (constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order) and Instruction-aware Mask (enables object tokens to directly access instruction context).

Result: Substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks, validated through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM demonstrates the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning, offering a simple, parameter-free solution that adapts attention to spatial structure while maintaining instruction guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Motivation: Existing diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation have made progress in synthesizing long sequences with audio-visual synchronization, but music-performance videos with camera motions remain largely unexplored. Current long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control.

Method: A cascaded framework integrating audio semantic analysis, interpretable shot planning (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, long-sequence consistency modeling, camera adapter module for embedding camera poses into latent noise, and time-aware dynamic window range strategy for adaptive denoising based on audio embeddings.

Result: The method achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos with precise music-motion-camera synchronization, as demonstrated through comprehensive benchmark tests.

Conclusion: YingVideo-MV represents the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation, enabling automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals with explicit camera motion control and enhanced continuity between clips.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes invariance issues in deep learning-based partial-to-partial point set registration using GMMs, identifies limitations in DeepGMR, and proposes an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer to achieve transformation-invariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates problems with feature vector invariance under translation and rotation in partial-to-partial point set registration, particularly in deep learning methods using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The authors aim to uncover why existing methods like DeepGMR fail in partial-to-partial scenarios and propose a solution.

Method: The authors introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer that robustly identifies a common reference point between two partial point sets using attention mechanisms. This layer helps acquire transformation-invariant features by finding a common reference point rather than focusing on overlap regions.

Result: The ARPS layer significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its variant UGMMReg. These extended models outperform prior deep learning methods that use attention blocks and Transformers to extract overlap regions or common reference points.

Conclusion: The findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs, demonstrating that focusing on common reference points rather than overlap regions leads to better transformation-invariant features and improved performance in partial-to-partial point set registration.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: Aligning generative process with data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) remains challenging in computer vision. The authors aim to improve Vision Transformer performance for SISR by leveraging self-supervised pre-training to learn rich visual representations before fine-tuning for the target task.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: 1) Self-supervised pre-training on a colorization task to learn generalizable visual representations, 2) Fine-tuning for 4x super-resolution. The model predicts a high-frequency residual image added to initial bicubic interpolation, simplifying residual learning.

Result: On DIV2K benchmark dataset, ViT-SR achieves SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB, demonstrating strong performance for 4x super-resolution.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach with self-supervised pre-training is effective for complex image restoration tasks. Larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks could yield further improvements.

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyMoE is a Mixture-of-Experts vision-language model designed for remote sensing tasks that uses adaptive routing and context-disentangled augmentation to handle multiple tasks and granularity levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 21 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision-language models are suboptimal for remote sensing tasks, and existing geospatial VLMs struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding.

Method: SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions to specialized LLM experts, plus a context-disentangled augmentation strategy creating contrastive pairs between local and global features to promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating SkyMoE's adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Conclusion: SkyMoE effectively addresses the limitations of existing geospatial VLMs by providing specialized expert handling for diverse remote sensing tasks and granularity levels, with comprehensive evaluation on the new MGRS-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

*Tai Le-Gia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This dissertation addresses zero-shot anomaly classification/segmentation by analyzing consistent anomalies, proposing CoDeGraph framework, extending to 3D medical imaging, and bridging batch/text-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot anomaly detection is crucial for industrial inspection and medical imaging where labeled training data is unavailable. The research aims to solve core challenges in detecting anomalies without any training samples.

Method: 1) Formalized consistent anomalies problem and analyzed patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, identifying similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. 2) Developed CoDeGraph framework using multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement. 3) Extended to 3D medical imaging with training-free volumetric tokenization for MRI. 4) Bridged batch/text-based methods using CoDeGraph pseudo-masks to supervise vision-language models.

Result: The dissertation provides theoretical understanding of consistent anomalies and practical solutions including CoDeGraph framework that effectively suppresses consistent anomalies, enables zero-shot 3D anomaly detection in medical imaging, and bridges different zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: This dissertation offers comprehensive theoretical insights and algorithmic solutions for zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation, addressing key challenges through principled approaches that work across industrial and medical domains without requiring training data.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

TL;DR: Noisy Query Tokens method bridges Vision-Language Models with Diffusion Models using distributed representations to prevent task generalization collapse and enable stable continual learning across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using fixed learnable query tokens suffer from task generalization collapse - they fail to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks, limiting their practical application in multimodal learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes Noisy Query Tokens that learn a distributed representation space between Vision-Language Models and Diffusion Models via end-to-end optimization. Also introduces a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details.

Result: Experimental results confirm the approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks, overcoming limitations of previous fixed-token methods.

Conclusion: The Noisy Query Tokens method successfully addresses the generalization collapse problem in bridging VLMs with Diffusion Models, providing a more robust and adaptable framework for multimodal continual learning.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free acceleration scheme for multi-view 3D models achieves 8-10× speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy by converting early global layers to frame attention and subsampling global attention with diagonal preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D models like VGGT and π³ rely heavily on global self-attention, resulting in high computational costs. While sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, there's no systematic understanding of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning.

Method: 1) Conducted in-depth analysis of global attention modules in VGGT and π³, revealing role division in alternating global-frame architecture. 2) Proposed training-free two-step acceleration: convert early global layers to frame attention, and subsample global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and mean-fill component.

Result: Achieves 8-10× speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving accuracy of original models. Remains robust in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Conclusion: The systematic analysis reveals clear role division in global attention modules, enabling effective training-free acceleration that maintains performance while dramatically reducing computational cost, even in challenging dense multi-view scenarios.

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

TL;DR: OmniPerson is a unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks that enables controllable data augmentation with high identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person re-identification suffers from limited training data due to privacy concerns and annotation costs. Existing pedestrian generation methods fail to ensure identity consistency and lack sufficient controllability for effective dataset augmentation.

Method: 1) OmniPerson unified generation model with holistic/fine-grained control over pedestrian attributes, supporting RGB/IR image/video generation with multiple reference images, poses, and text. 2) Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation from any number of reference images. 3) PersonSyn dataset with automated curation pipeline transforming public ReID benchmarks into richly annotated resources.

Result: OmniPerson achieves state-of-the-art in pedestrian generation with excellent visual fidelity and identity consistency. Augmenting existing datasets with generated data consistently improves ReID model performance.

Conclusion: OmniPerson provides an effective solution for data augmentation in ReID tasks by enabling controllable, identity-preserving pedestrian generation across multiple modalities, with open-source release of code, models, and dataset.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

TL;DR: Panel2Patch: A data pipeline that extracts hierarchical vision-language supervision from biomedical figures by parsing layouts, panels, and markers to create multi-granular training pairs, enabling more effective pretraining with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical vision-language pretraining uses coarse figure-level pairs, discarding fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually use when examining local structures in scientific figures.

Method: Panel2Patch parses biomedical figures and captions to extract hierarchical structure (layouts, panels, visual markers), constructing aligned vision-language pairs at figure, panel, and patch levels. Uses granularity-aware pretraining strategy with heterogeneous objectives from coarse to fine descriptions.

Result: Panel2Patch extracts far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data when applied to only a small set of literature figures.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach to biomedical vision-language pretraining preserves local semantics and fine-grained correspondences that are clinically relevant, leading to more efficient and effective model training.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

### [60] [Co-speech Gesture Video Generation via Motion-Based Graph Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02576)
*Yafei Song,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for co-speech gesture synthesis using diffusion models for motion generation followed by motion-based retrieval from a graph, addressing the many-to-many mapping challenge between audio and gestures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for co-speech gesture synthesis using motion graphs rely on one-to-one mapping between audio features and motions, which is inadequate for the many-to-many nature of audio-gesture relationships. This limitation hinders synchronization accuracy and naturalness.

Method: 1) Use a diffusion model to generate gesture motions by learning the joint distribution of audio and motion from multi-level audio features. 2) Apply a motion-based retrieval algorithm to find the best path in a motion graph using global and local similarity assessment. 3) Stitch discontinuous segments from the retrieved path into coherent video output.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over prior approaches in both synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the many-to-many mapping challenge in audio-gesture synthesis by combining diffusion-based motion generation with motion-graph retrieval, resulting in more synchronized and natural co-speech gestures.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

*Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Fredo Durand,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture-mapped Gaussian Splatting that adaptively adjusts texture resolution to represent fine appearance details more efficiently than using many small Gaussian primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods waste resources by representing fine appearance details as numerous small Gaussian primitives, even when geometry and appearance have different frequency characteristics. Texture mapping offers a more efficient alternative for detailed appearance representation.

Method: Proposes per-primitive texture maps for 2D Gaussian primitives with adaptive texture resolution that bounds texel size by image sampling frequency. Uses adaptive upscaling/downscaling during optimization and enables control of primitive count based on texture resolution.

Result: The approach achieves favorable image quality with fewer total parameters compared to alternative textured Gaussian primitive solutions, demonstrating more efficient representation of detailed appearance.

Conclusion: Texture mapping integrated into Gaussian Splatting optimization provides a principled way to represent detailed appearance efficiently, reducing parameter count while maintaining image quality through adaptive texture resolution control.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on visual perception factors (aesthetics, instruction adherence, temporal coherence) but largely ignore rule-based reasoning capabilities. Recent preliminary explorations lack fine-grained decomposition of reasoning abilities and comprehensive evaluation protocols.

Method: Built upon text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. Evaluation uses a checklist with four metrics, leveraging GPT-o3 for scoring with 85% alignment to human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models achieve only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, indicating significant room for improvement in reasoning capabilities. The benchmark demonstrates current models' limitations in rule-based reasoning.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating reasoning abilities in video generation models, revealing substantial gaps in current capabilities. The insights will facilitate development of reasoning-aware video generation toward vision foundation intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion suffer from poor generalization to unseen datasets due to limited real training data and domain gaps between different satellite sensors.

Method: Constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations to natural and remote sensing images, then pretrains fusion models on these simulated data to learn robust spatial-spectral representations.

Result: Pretrained models significantly improve generalization across six satellite datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) in zero-shot and one-shot settings, with superior performance across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion, and demonstrates the potential of foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

TL;DR: SelVA is a text-conditioned selective video-to-audio generation model that produces only user-intended sounds from multi-object videos, enabling precise audio editing in multimedia production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-audio approaches generate mixed sounds from all objects at once, making precise audio editing difficult. Multimedia production requires individual audio tracks for each sound source for editing, mixing, and creative control.

Method: SelVA treats text prompts as explicit selectors, modulates video encoder to extract prompt-relevant features, uses supplementary tokens to suppress text-irrelevant activations via cross-attention, and employs self-augmentation to overcome lack of mono audio supervision.

Result: SelVA outperforms existing methods on the VGG-MONOAUDIO benchmark, demonstrating effectiveness in audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization through extensive experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: SelVA successfully addresses the selective video-to-audio generation task, providing a practical solution for multimedia production where individual sound source control is essential.

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid document retrieval system combining ColPali's patch-level visual similarity with OCR bounding boxes to retrieve specific regions instead of entire pages, improving precision for RAG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs like ColPali retrieve entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for RAG where precise context is needed. OCR systems extract structured text with coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment.

Method: Unified hybrid architecture using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. Formalizes coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduces intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establishes theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Operates at inference time without additional training.

Result: The approach enables retrieval of specific document regions rather than entire pages. Implementation released as open-source Snappy system with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture successfully bridges the gap between visual semantic retrieval and precise spatial localization, offering improved precision for retrieval-augmented generation applications without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

*Derui Shan,Qian Qiao,Hao Lu,Tao Du,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR embeds polarization priors into 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of specular scenes without environment maps or restrictive material assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for specular scene reconstruction face limitations: Polarization-aware NeRF is slow and dependent on material/viewpoint assumptions, while 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with reflection-geometry entanglement and requires environment maps for deferred reflection modules.

Method: Proposes a polarization-forward-guided paradigm with bidirectional coupling: 1) uses 3DGS geometric priors to resolve polarization ambiguity, 2) uses refined polarization cues to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation, achieving reflection separation without environment maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis on public and self-collected datasets while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: First framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: UAUTrack provides an effective unified framework for cross-modal Anti-UAV tracking that addresses current limitations in multimodal fusion and achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

*Zhongbao Yang,Jiangxin Dong,Yazhou Yao,Jinhui Tang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR is a lightweight diffusion method for image super-resolution that reduces computational costs through progressive pruning and phase-guided adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution models rely on large backbones like SDXL and DiT, causing excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference.

Method: 1) Progressive pruning approach to remove redundant blocks from diffusion backbone while preserving restoration capability; 2) Phase-exchange adapter module that uses phase information of inputs to guide the pruned model for better performance.

Result: Achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption compared to large diffusion models.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR provides an efficient alternative to large diffusion models for image super-resolution by combining progressive pruning with phase-guided adaptation, maintaining performance while reducing resource requirements.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

*Huankun Sheng,Ming Li,Yixiang Wei,Yeying Fan,Yu-Hui Wen,Tieliang Gong,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASA is a two-stage foreground-aware slot attention framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to improve object discovery, using dual-slot competition and pseudo-mask guidance to reduce background interference and over-segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, leading to background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. There's a need for explicit foreground-background separation to enable precise object discovery.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Coarse scene decomposition with dual-slot competition to distinguish foreground from background using clustering-based initialization. 2) Masked slot attention where first slot captures background and remaining slots compete for foreground objects, enhanced with pseudo-mask guidance from patch affinity graphs using self-supervised features.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

Conclusion: FASA demonstrates that explicit foreground-background separation and pseudo-mask guidance significantly improve object discovery performance, providing a more robust approach for unsupervised scene decomposition that handles real-world data better than previous methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

*Abdullah Al Asif,Farhana Chowdhury Tisha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system using attention-inceptionv3 model to detect mask usage and social distancing compliance with 98-99.5% accuracy for COVID-19 risk area identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help minimize COVID-19 spread by automatically detecting violations of WHO protocols (mask wearing and 6-foot physical distancing) to identify high-risk areas.

Method: Developed a system using customized attention-inceptionv3 model trained on 10,800 images from two datasets (with/without masks) to detect mask usage and social distancing compliance.

Result: Achieved 98% training accuracy, 99.5% validation accuracy, 98.2% precision, and 25 FPS frame rate for real-time monitoring of COVID-19 protocol compliance.

Conclusion: The system can effectively identify high-risk virus spreading zones, enabling authorities to take timely preventive measures and alert local populations about protocol violations.

Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.

### [73] [ClimaOoD: Improving Anomaly Segmentation via Physically Realistic Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02686)
*Yuxing Liu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClimaDrive is a semantics-guided image-to-image framework that synthesizes realistic out-of-distribution driving data with weather diversity and physical plausibility, addressing limitations of existing synthetic data generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly segmentation for autonomous driving suffers from scarce and limited-diversity anomaly data, while existing synthetic data generation methods lack contextual coherence and physical realism, creating domain gaps between synthetic and real data.

Method: ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting to create semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. The framework constructs ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six driving scenarios under clear and adverse weather conditions.

Result: Training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation across four state-of-the-art methods. AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD enhances model robustness and offers valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantically coherent and physically plausible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: ALDI++ domain adaptation framework improves object detection in security X-ray imagery by addressing domain shifts caused by device and environmental variations, achieving SOTA performance with ViTDet backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation is crucial for object detection in real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance.

TL;DR: DF-Mamba: A deformable Mamba-based framework for 3D hand pose estimation that addresses occlusion challenges by better capturing global context through selective state modeling and deformable scanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D hand pose estimation methods struggle with severe occlusions (like overlapping hands) and rely on ResNet/CNN backbones that have limited capability to model global context needed for robust feature learning in occluded scenarios.

Method: Proposes Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba) framework using state space modeling (Mamba) with deformable state scanning. It aggregates local features from convolution while selectively preserving useful global context cues through deformable scanning, enabling better modeling of relationships between local features and global context.

Result: Outperforms latest image backbones (VMamba, Spatial-Mamba) on all five divergent datasets covering single-hand/two-hand scenarios, hand-only/hand-object interactions, and RGB/depth-based estimation. Achieves state-of-the-art performance with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D hand pose estimation by better capturing global context through Mamba's selective state modeling and deformable scanning, offering superior accuracy with efficient inference.

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoBridge is a foundation model for cross-view geo-localization that uses semantic anchors to bridge multi-view features through textual descriptions, enabling bidirectional matching across drone, satellite, and street views with language-to-image retrieval support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional satellite-centric geo-localization is limited by availability of high-resolution/up-to-date satellite imagery and fails to exploit complementary cues across different views (drone, satellite, street) and modalities (language, image).

Method: Proposes GeoBridge with a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions. Also introduces GeoLoc dataset - first large-scale cross-modal multi-view aligned dataset with 50,000+ image pairs and textual descriptions from 36 countries.

Result: GeoLoc pre-training significantly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The model supports bidirectional matching across views and language-to-image retrieval.

Conclusion: GeoBridge addresses limitations of traditional satellite-centric geo-localization by leveraging multi-view and multi-modal data through semantic anchors, with the GeoLoc dataset enabling robust, flexible localization across diverse geographic contexts.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

TL;DR: RAMF framework improves hate speech detection in videos through multimodal fusion and adversarial reasoning, achieving 3-7% performance gains over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech in online videos is becoming more serious as content becomes multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods struggle with complex multimodal semantic relationships and nuanced hateful content understanding.

Method: Proposes Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework with two key components: (1) Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) for capturing local cues and global temporal structures, and Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) for fine-grained multimodal interaction; (2) Adversarial reasoning using a vision-language model to generate objective descriptions, hate-assumed inferences, and non-hate-assumed inferences for enriched contextual understanding.

Result: Evaluation on two real-world hateful video datasets shows robust generalization performance, improving state-of-the-art methods by 3% in Macro-F1 and 7% in hate class recall.

Conclusion: The RAMF framework effectively addresses multimodal hate speech detection challenges through innovative fusion techniques and adversarial reasoning, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner is a training-free token pruning method for vision-language models that balances redundancy and spatial sparsity to reduce computational costs while preserving object details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods for VLMs either overlook inter-token redundancy (retaining duplicated tokens) or ignore spatial relationships (leading to overly sparse selections that fail to cover target objects), limiting deployment on mobile devices due to high computational costs.

Method: Proposes centrifugal token pruning paradigm for near-to-far selection, Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion to defer selection of spatially distant tokens, parallel greedy strategy for efficient selection, and selective fusion of salient information from discarded tokens to retained ones.

Result: VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9% pruning rate while delivering end-to-end inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free token pruning algorithm effectively balances redundancy and spatial sparsity, enabling efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained devices while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: A sex-stratified whole-body MR image registration method using adipose tissue and muscle masks improves registration accuracy for UK Biobank data compared to intensity-only and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UK Biobank collects whole-body MR images and health data, requiring robust inter-subject registration for spatial standardization and correlation analysis between imaging and non-imaging parameters.

Method: Sex-stratified registration using subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle masks from VIBESegmentator to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration, evaluated on 4000 subjects.

Result: Mean Dice scores of 0.77/0.75 (males/females), 6pp higher than intensity-only, 8-13pp higher than other methods; reduced label error frequency; less noisy age-correlation maps with better anatomical alignment.

Conclusion: Using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images, enabling better spatial standardization and correlation analysis for medical research.

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

*Mohamed Awad,Mahmoud Akrm,Walid Gomaa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial training paradoxically increases transferability of adversarial attacks, creating new ecosystem risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial training improves model robustness, its effect on attack transferability is underexplored. The paper investigates whether adversarial training unintentionally makes attacks more transferable between models.

Method: Trained 36 diverse models (CNNs and ViTs) and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments to analyze how adversarial training affects attack transferability.

Result: Adversarially trained models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, revealing a paradox where robustness enhancement increases ecosystem risk.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluations should assess both resistance to transferred attacks and propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples. The authors release all models, code, and scripts for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoViS is a geospatially rewarded visual search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring multimodal LLM visual grounding capabilities to remote sensing imagery is challenging due to extremely small targets in kilometer-scale scenes and complex geospatial relations involving relative positions, spatial hierarchies, and contextual dependencies across distant objects.

Method: GeoViS reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process using a tree-structured sequence of visual cues. It actively explores the global image through multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to iteratively refine geospatial hypotheses.

Result: Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, showing strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: GeoViS effectively addresses the challenges of remote sensing visual grounding by enabling detection of subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness through its progressive search-and-reasoning framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

*Yifan Li,Yingda Yin,Lingting Zhu,Weikai Chen,Shengju Qian,Xin Wang,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVSeg introduces explicit multi-step reasoning for video object segmentation by decomposing the task into three sequential operations and using reinforcement learning to optimize the reasoning chain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object segmentation methods collapse complex reasoning about dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions into simplified latent embeddings, making the reasoning chain opaque and intractable. The paper aims to make reasoning explicit and interpretable.

Method: ReVSeg decomposes reasoning into three explicit operations: semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding, executed sequentially using pretrained vision-language models. Reinforcement learning is employed to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain from outcome-driven signals.

Result: ReVSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and produces interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition of reasoning into sequential operations, combined with reinforcement learning optimization, enables more effective and interpretable video object segmentation compared to traditional latent embedding approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

TL;DR: CAEVL is a novel image-based localization method for UAVs that eliminates the need for paired UAV-satellite training data by learning directly from satellite images using domain shift simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV localization methods require expensive paired UAV-satellite datasets that are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting practical applicability in GNSS-denied environments.

Method: The approach uses a training paradigm that learns directly from satellite-view reference images without UAV imagery, employing a dedicated augmentation strategy to simulate visual domain shifts between satellite and real-world UAV views. The CAEVL model is designed to exploit this paradigm.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities on the new ViLD dataset of real-world UAV images.

Conclusion: CAEVL provides an effective solution for UAV image-based localization without requiring paired training data, offering practical advantages for real-world applications in GNSS-denied environments.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

*Rakib Ahsan,MD Sadik Hossain Shanto,Md Sultanul Arifin,Tanzima Hashem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet is an attention-enhanced deep learning framework that combines NDMI with attention U-Net for methane plume detection in Sentinel-2 imagery, achieving better performance than existing methods with lower false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas requiring accurate detection for climate action. Current methods (band differences/ratios) generate many false positives requiring expert verification, while CNN-based deep learning lacks mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features.

Method: AttMetNet integrates Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with attention-enhanced U-Net architecture. It uses methane-aware design to fuse NDMI's plume-sensitive cues with attention-driven feature selection, amplifying methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. Focal loss addresses class imbalance from limited plume samples and sparse plume pixels.

Result: AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with lower false positive rate, better precision-recall balance, and higher IoU. It's trained on real methane plume dataset for robustness in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: AttMetNet establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery by jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection.

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

*Qifan Liang,Junlin Li,Zhen Han,Xihao Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Bin Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANet: First smoke-type-aware laparoscopic video desmoking network that distinguishes between Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke, outperforming existing methods and improving surgical task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke from electrocautery/lasers obstructs laparoscopic video guidance. Existing desmoking methods fail to account for different smoke types with distinct motion patterns and spatio-temporal characteristics.

Method: Proposes STANet with two sub-networks: 1) smoke mask segmentation network with coarse-to-fine disentanglement module for mask and type prediction, 2) smokeless video reconstruction network guided by smoke masks. Uses attention-weighted mask aggregation and smoke-type-aware cross attention.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations and shows superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks. Also constructs first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

Conclusion: STANet effectively addresses smoke-type-specific distinctions in laparoscopic videos, providing better desmoking performance and practical utility for surgical guidance and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

TL;DR: MRD is a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding that addresses object fragmentation in crop-based methods by using multi-resolution semantic fusion and open-vocabulary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images. Existing crop-based methods fragment objects across multiple crops, disrupting semantic similarity computation and object integrity.

Method: Proposes Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD) with: 1) Multi-resolution semantic fusion to integrate similarity maps from different resolutions, 2) Open-vocabulary object detection with sliding-window approach for direct object localization.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks show effectiveness across different MLLMs.

Conclusion: MRD effectively addresses object fragmentation in high-resolution image understanding by preserving object integrity through multi-resolution processing and direct object detection.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Xu Han,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Xianzhi Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX is a structured diffusion framework that jointly generates multiple intrinsic scene properties (albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, color) from text prompts with physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-intrinsic generation methods lack structural consistency and physical coherence when generating multiple intrinsic scene properties simultaneously. There's a need for a framework that can produce comprehensive, physically consistent intrinsic maps from text descriptions.

Method: LumiX uses two key innovations: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention that shares queries across all maps in self-attention blocks to ensure structural consistency, and 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that efficiently models cross-map relations for joint training. This enables stable joint diffusion training for multiple intrinsic properties.

Result: LumiX achieves 23% higher alignment and better preference scores (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to state-of-the-art methods. It produces coherent, physically meaningful results and can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

Conclusion: LumiX provides an effective structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation, enabling joint production of multiple physically consistent scene properties through novel attention and adaptation mechanisms.

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

*Yancheng Zhang,Guangyu Sun,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGGS (Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting) is a hybrid 2D/3D Gaussian representation that balances appearance fidelity and geometric accuracy for novel view synthesis, outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting methods have trade-offs: 3DGS provides high appearance fidelity but suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, while 2DGS ensures multi-view consistency but loses texture details. There's a need for a method that balances both appearance quality and geometric accuracy.

Method: EGGS integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians with three key components: 1) Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, 2) Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and 3) Frequency-Decoupled Optimization to exploit strengths of each representation type. The system is CUDA-accelerated for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: EGGS successfully addresses the limitations of both 2DGS and 3DGS by combining their strengths in a hybrid representation, achieving superior balance between appearance fidelity and geometric consistency for novel view synthesis applications.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5 improves small object tracking by adding motion direction awareness and occlusion handling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TrackNet versions have limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to reliance on visual cues only, while V4 introduces motion inputs but suffers from directional ambiguity by discarding motion polarity information.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module that decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields to encode both movement occurrence and trajectory direction, and 2) Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head, a Transformer-based module using factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate corrective residuals for recovering occluded targets.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and accuracy of 0.9733 on TrackNetV2 dataset, significantly outperforming previous versions with only 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: TrackNetV5 successfully addresses the limitations of previous versions by incorporating directional motion priors and robust occlusion handling, establishing a new benchmark for fast-moving small object tracking in sports applications.

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Motivation: Existing video benchmarks focus on physical commonsense but lack evaluation of scientific reasoning capabilities needed for accurate modeling of real-world scientific laws and phenomena.

Method: Created VideoScience-Bench with 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics/chemistry. Evaluated 7 state-of-the-art video models using expert annotations across 5 dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Used VLM-as-a-Judge for assessment.

Result: Strong correlation observed between VLM-as-a-Judge assessments and human expert evaluations. The benchmark reveals current video models' limitations in scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models as scientific reasoners, not just generators, requiring demonstrations of scientific understanding consistent with expected physical/chemical phenomena.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Result: The pipeline yields UnicEdit-10M (10M-scale dataset) and UnicBench benchmark. Analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the data scarcity and evaluation challenges in multimodal image editing by providing scalable, high-quality training data (UnicEdit-10M) and a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark (UnicBench) with novel evaluation metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUD is a novel hierarchical uncertainty-aware disambiguation network for composed video retrieval that addresses modality information density disparity to improve multi-modal query understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CVR methods overlook the information density disparity between video (rich semantics) and text (sparser semantics), leading to modification subject referring ambiguity and limited detailed semantic focus, which degrades retrieval performance.

Method: HUD framework with three key components: (1) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation for cross-modal interaction, (2) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling for fine-grained semantics, and (3) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment to exploit overlapping semantics and enhance detailed semantic focus.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) and Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks.

Conclusion: HUD effectively addresses modality disparity issues through hierarchical uncertainty-aware disambiguation, enabling precise composed feature learning and superior retrieval performance across video and image domains.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of shared world modeling - generating multiple videos from input images that represent the same underlying world from different camera perspectives. Current video-based world models need better methods to ensure consistency across generated videos in terms of both scene geometry and object motion.

Method: IC-World leverages the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models for parallel generation. It's further fine-tuned via reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization, combined with two novel reward models: one for enforcing scene-level geometry consistency and another for object-level motion consistency across generated videos.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency metrics. The paper represents the first systematic exploration of shared world modeling with video-based world models.

Conclusion: IC-World successfully addresses the shared world modeling problem by combining in-context generation capabilities with reinforcement learning optimization for cross-video consistency, establishing a new benchmark for generating consistent multi-view video representations of the same world.

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

*Fan Wu,Cheng Chen,Zhoujie Fu,Jiacheng Wei,Yi Xu,Deheng Ye,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCustom is a fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to accurately customize physical concepts through novel regularization losses, addressing limitations of existing methods that fail to reflect physical properties in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods excel at concrete concepts like styles and shapes but fail at physical concept customization due to lack of explicit physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in prompts, existing methods cannot accurately reflect corresponding physical properties in generated results.

Method: PhyCustom introduces a fine-tuning framework with two novel regularization losses: 1) isometric loss to activate diffusion models to learn physical concepts, and 2) decouple loss to eliminate mixture learning of independent concepts.

Result: Experiments on a diverse dataset show PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in physical customization both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables diffusion models to perform accurate physical concept customization through explicit introduction of physical knowledge and novel regularization techniques.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAG method uses single-frame multimodal features (RGB + depth) with prior action context for competitive action anticipation without temporal video aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can predict upcoming actions from single moments with sufficient context, but conventional methods rely on temporal video aggregation. The paper investigates whether models can achieve similar single-frame anticipation competence.

Method: AAG (Action Anticipation at a Glimpse) combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action context from either textual summaries (Vision-Language Models) or single-frame action recognizer predictions.

Result: AAG performs competitively compared to temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

Conclusion: Multimodal single-frame action anticipation can effectively replace video aggregation for action prediction tasks, demonstrating that models can achieve human-like anticipation competence from glimpses when provided with sufficient contextual information.

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic study of identity-preserving AI-generated content detection for Indian/South-Asian faces, showing fine-tuned detectors overfit to training-generator cues and fail to generalize to held-out IP-AIGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern image editors can create identity-preserving AI-generated content (IP-AIGC) where the same person appears with new attributes, but the robustness and fairness of current detectors for under-represented populations like Indian/South-Asian faces remains unclear.

Method: Assembled Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF datasets, created two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. Evaluated two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained and fine-tuned regimes using AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (e.g., AIDE AUC drops from 0.923 to 0.563), indicating overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, pretrained performance remains high, suggesting specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than generic distribution shift.

Conclusion: IP-AIGC-Indian represents a challenging and practically relevant scenario that motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to address generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning effectively addresses data scarcity in digital dentistry, with successful SSL methods for segmentation and registration. Public data and code ensure reproducibility and advance the field.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current video diffusion models rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for camera control, leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored despite its potential for better optimization.

Method: Introduces online RL post-training framework with verifiable geometry reward that provides dense segment-level feedback. Estimates 3D camera trajectories for generated and reference videos, divides trajectories into segments, computes segment-wise relative poses, and compares generated-reference segment pairs for alignment scores.

Result: The online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Conclusion: Online RL post-training with verifiable geometry rewards and comprehensive datasets effectively improves camera-controlled video generation, offering a promising direction beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Motivation: To understand how different 2D projection methods from LiDAR point clouds affect metric place recognition performance when used with vision foundation models, and to determine which projection characteristics are most important for practical autonomy applications.

Method: Developed a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol to isolate the influence of 2D projections. Used consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios to analyze projection characteristics.

Result: Identified projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments validated practical relevance and showed carefully designed projections can effectively serve as surrogate for end-to-end 3D learning.

Conclusion: Well-designed LiDAR-to-image projections can be an effective alternative to end-to-end 3D learning for LiDAR place recognition, with specific projection characteristics being crucial for performance in practical autonomy applications.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model.

Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have computational bottlenecks requiring many inference steps. Existing distillation methods for fewer steps suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization.

Method: Propose phase-aware acceleration strategy with two specialized LoRA adapters: Slow-LoRA for early semantic stages (smaller speedups) and Fast-LoRA for later redundant phases (larger speedups). Uses lightweight adapters instead of full retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 5× acceleration over base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. LoRA experts trained with only 1 sample on a single V100 within one hour, yet generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Conclusion: Lightweight phase-aware LoRA adapters provide efficient diffusion acceleration with strong generalization, avoiding heavy retraining costs while achieving significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

TL;DR: DiverseAR addresses sample diversity limitations in bitwise autoregressive image generation models by introducing adaptive logits scaling and energy-based path search to enhance diversity while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. Current bitwise AR models suffer from limited diversity due to binary classification constraints and overly sharp logits distributions that cause sampling collapse.

Method: DiverseAR introduces two key components: (1) an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of binary output distributions during sampling for smoother predictions, and (2) an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens to preserve visual quality while enhancing diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation without sacrificing visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed DiverseAR method effectively addresses diversity limitations in bitwise AR models through principled techniques that balance diversity enhancement with visual fidelity preservation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: LoVoRA presents a novel mask-free approach to video object editing that eliminates the need for external guidance, offering improved scalability and generalization while maintaining spatial and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

*Guowen Zhang,Chenhang He,Liyi Chen,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVDilation is a LiDAR-centric fusion framework for 3D object detection that prioritizes LiDAR data while using image features as implicit guidance to address point cloud sparsity and semantic limitations, achieving SOTA performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LiDAR-camera fusion methods suffer from degraded performance due to indiscriminate fusion of geometrically disparate sensors. The fundamental accuracy gap between LiDAR (precise geometry) and cameras (depth estimation errors) causes spatial misalignment when naively fused.

Method: Proposes BEVDilation with two key components: 1) Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that densifies foreground voxels using image priors to mitigate point cloud sparsity, and 2) Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block that enhances LiDAR feature diffusion with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. Formulates image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion methods.

Conclusion: BEVDilation's LiDAR-centric strategy with image features as implicit guidance effectively addresses spatial misalignment issues, mitigates point cloud sparsity, and enhances semantic understanding, resulting in superior 3D object detection performance with better robustness to sensor noise.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIA is a novel image-centric jailbreak attack method that embeds harmful queries into benign visual contexts using multi-agent systems and visualization strategies, outperforming existing text-image interplay attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM jailbreak attacks focus on text-image interplay and treat visual modality as secondary prompts, underutilizing images' potential to carry complex contextual information for attacks.

Method: Proposes Contextual Image Attack (CIA) using multi-agent system to embed harmful queries into benign visual contexts with four visualization strategies, plus contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques.

Result: Achieves toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, with ASR reaching 86.31% and 91.07%, significantly outperforming prior work on MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset.

Conclusion: Visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs, demonstrating the need for stronger safety alignments against image-centric attacks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InEx is a training-free multi-agent framework that uses introspective reasoning and external cross-modal verification to autonomously mitigate hallucinations in multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in LLMs, hindering reliable MLLM development. Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize agents' autonomous mitigation capabilities. The authors draw inspiration from human decision-making processes where people use introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and external verification from diverse perspectives.

Method: InEx is a training-free, multi-agent framework with internal introspective reasoning guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: InEx effectively addresses hallucination in MLLMs through a cognitive-inspired approach combining introspective reasoning and external verification, offering a promising direction for autonomous hallucination mitigation without requiring training.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U4D is an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling that addresses varying spatial uncertainty in dynamic 3D environments through hard-to-easy generation and spatio-temporal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks for 4D LiDAR world modeling treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This leads to artifacts in complex/ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability for autonomous driving and embodied AI applications.

Method: U4D first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to identify semantically challenging regions. It then performs two-stage generation: (1) uncertainty-region modeling for high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion for remaining areas using learned structural priors. It also incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block for adaptive fusion of spatial and temporal representations during diffusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Conclusion: U4D presents an effective uncertainty-aware framework that improves 4D LiDAR world modeling by addressing spatial uncertainty variations, enabling more realistic and temporally stable reconstructions for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

TL;DR: LogMe collects smartphone sensor data with dual labels (sedentary activity + social context), and DySTAN uses multi-task learning with cross-task attention to jointly classify both context dimensions, significantly improving accuracy over single-task and existing multi-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main challenges: 1) Recognizing sedentary activities (studying, lectures, relaxing, eating) with highly similar inertial patterns is difficult, and 2) Social context is critical for understanding user behavior but often overlooked in mobile sensing research.

Method: 1) LogMe mobile app passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, rotation vector) with hourly self-reports for dual labels. 2) DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network) - a multi-task learning framework with task-specific layers and cross-task attention to jointly classify both sedentary activity and social context from shared sensor inputs.

Conclusion: Modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions (sedentary activity + social context) improves accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition. The proposed DySTAN framework effectively captures subtle distinctions through multi-task learning with cross-task attention.

Abstract: Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.

Abstract: In the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, ultra-short pulse laser micromachining stands out as a promising solution while also offering high-precision and qualitative laser processing. However, unlocking the full potential of ultra-short pulse lasers requires an optimized monitoring system capable of early detection of defective workpieces, regardless of the preprocessing technique employed. While advances in machine learning can help predict process quality features, the complexity of monitoring data necessitates reducing both model size and data dimensionality to enable real-time analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training. Through these advancements, we aim to establish the baseline for a more sustainable manufacturing process.

TL;DR: Seizure-NGCLNet: A node-graph dual contrastive learning framework that learns spatial epileptogenic patterns from SEEG data for accurate drug-resistant epilepsy seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with complex spatial connectivity patterns in epilepsy (interictal suppression and ictal propagation) due to low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates and difficulty obtaining expert labels for spatial pathological patterns.

Method: 1) Adaptive graph augmentation using centrality metrics to generate seizure-related brain networks; 2) Dual-contrastive learning combining global graph-level and local node-graph contrast to encode spatial structural and semantic features; 3) Fine-tuning pretrained embeddings via top-k localized graph attention network for classification.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on large-scale SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients: 95.93% accuracy, 96.25% sensitivity, 94.12% specificity. Visualizations show clear separation of ictal from interictal states, reflecting clinically relevant suppression and propagation patterns.

Conclusion: Seizure-NGCLNet effectively learns interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection accuracy and seizure onset zone localization for drug-resistant epilepsy.

Abstract: Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.

TL;DR: Hardware impairments degrade ISAC sensing performance by amplifying clutter noise; proposed distortion-aware precoding and power allocation methods overcome these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While hardware impairments' impact on communication spectral efficiency is well-studied, their effect on sensing performance in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems remains unexplored, particularly in cluttered environments where distortions can mask target echoes.

Method: Derived sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) to quantify hardware distortion effects, then proposed two approaches: 1) distortion- and clutter-aware precoding that minimizes deviation from communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness, and 2) alternative power allocation-based approach for reduced computational complexity.

Result: Numerical results confirm hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, and the proposed approaches effectively overcome hardware- and clutter-induced limitations with significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.

Conclusion: Hardware impairments pose serious challenges to ISAC sensing in cluttered environments, but distortion-aware designs (precoding and power allocation) can mitigate these effects and improve system robustness against hardware-induced limitations.

Abstract: The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WDM was previously developed for line-of-sight holographic MIMO systems, but real-world channels often involve non-line-of-sight propagation. The paper aims to extend WDM theory to NLoS scenarios to enable more practical holographic MIMO system design.

Method: Extends WDM to NLoS holographic MIMO channels, derives angular-domain representation through power spectral factor and power spectral density analysis, obtains closed-form characterization for isotropic scattering, and validates with numerical simulations.

Result: Successfully extends WDM to NLoS channels, obtains angular-domain representation, recovers Jakes' isotropic model as a special case, and provides numerical evaluation of degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity for both isotropic and non-isotropic scattering.

Conclusion: WDM can be effectively extended to NLoS holographic MIMO channels, providing theoretical foundations and practical insights for designing holographic MIMO systems in realistic propagation environments.

Abstract: Wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) was introduced as a counterpart of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing in the spatial-frequency domain for line-of-sight holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we extend WDM to holographic MIMO channels with non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation. We show that applying WDM to the NLoS channel yields the corresponding angular-domain representation, which we characterize through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further obtain a closed-form characterization for the case of isotropic scattering, recovering Jakes' isotropic model. The analysis is complemented by numerical results evaluating the degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity under both isotropic and non-isotropic scattering.

Conclusion: The framework achieves favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment, with demonstrated improvements through simulations and real-world experiments using commercial devices.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication is widely acknowledged as a foundational technology for next-generation mobile networks. Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently planning low-altitude ISAC networks where UAVs operate in structured air corridors, requiring both sensing and communication coverage while minimizing deployment costs.

Method: Uses channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites before deployment. Formulates the problem as large-scale nonconvex integer programming minimizing weighted sum of corridor length and BS count. Develops hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm to solve it.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed joint design reduces overall deployment cost while ensuring coverage of low-altitude ISAC networks.

Conclusion: The joint air corridor planning and BS deployment approach using CKM-based offline planning and hierarchical optimization algorithm effectively balances cost reduction with coverage requirements for low-altitude ISAC networks.

Abstract: This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology for next generation wireless systems, combining the benefits of distributed antenna systems (DAS) and traditional MIMO technology. In this work, we present the first extensive channel measurements for CF-mMIMO in the mid-band (FR3, 6-24 GHz), using a virtual widely distributed antenna array comprising 512 elements in the urban Macrocell (UMa) environment.

TL;DR: Proposes an integrated CSI acquisition framework for FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems combining CSI feedback, UL/DL channel estimation, and channel prediction to overcome training overhead and fast temporal variation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FR3 (upper mid-band) systems face significant CSI acquisition challenges: increased antennas and bandwidth cause prohibitive training overhead with traditional approaches, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster channel temporal variation.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) JUDCEN (Joint UL/DL Channel Estimation Network) fuses incomplete SRS and CSI-RS observations for full spatial CSI reconstruction; 2) TMCFN (Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network) uses MLP to exploit angle- and delay-domain features; 3) MCPN (Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network) employs selective state-space models for long-range temporal prediction in angle-delay domain.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks in both CSI acquisition accuracy and transmission spectral efficiency while maintaining lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: The integrated CSI acquisition framework effectively addresses FR3 challenges by combining estimation, feedback, and prediction components, enabling accurate CSI acquisition with reduced overhead and improved system performance.

Abstract: In next-generation wireless communication systems, the newly designated upper mid-band has attracted considerable attention, also called frequency range 3 (FR3), highlighting the need for downlink (DL) transmission design, which fundamentally relies on accurate CSI. However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks in both CSI acquisition accuracy and transmission spectral efficiency with lower computational complexity.

Motivation: Power amplifier non-linearity degrades linear precoding performance in MU-MIMO systems. While DPD modules can linearize PAs, they are costly and power-hungry. The paper seeks alternative solutions that can achieve interference cancellation despite PA non-linearity.

Method: Proposes non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes that exploit knowledge of PA non-linear response. Provides initial iterative solutions for two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenarios with even number of BS antennas, where each antenna has third-order memory-less PA non-linearity.

Result: The proposed approach achieves NLA-ZF precoding (up to adjustable tolerance) and provides performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference, offering an alternative to costly DPD modules.

Conclusion: NLA-ZF precoding enables interference cancellation despite PA non-linearity without requiring perfect DPD modules, offering a practical solution for MU-MIMO systems with non-linear power amplifiers.

Abstract: In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, the non-linear behavior of the power amplifiers (PAs) may cause degradation of the linear precoding schemes dealing with interference between user equipments (UEs), e.g., the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder. One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference.

TL;DR: Switch-based beamforming architectures can approach all-digital MIMO performance at much lower cost and complexity when using proper electromagnetic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional all-digital and hybrid MIMO beamforming architectures become excessively expensive and power-hungry when scaling to large antenna arrays. Existing switch-based solutions use oversimplified models that ignore key electromagnetic effects like antenna coupling and matching losses.

Method: Used a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches.

Result: Demonstrated that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain performance of all-digital solutions while offering significantly lower cost and complexity.

Conclusion: Switch-based beamforming with proper electromagnetic modeling is a viable, cost-effective alternative to conventional MIMO architectures for large-scale antenna arrays.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers substantial spectral-efficiency gains, but scaling to very large antenna arrays with conventional all-digital and hybrid beamforming architectures quickly results in excessively high costs and power consumption. Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity.

TL;DR: Proposes a physics-inspired diffusion model for Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) construction in 6G systems that integrates physical constraints with generative diffusion models to improve accuracy and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CKM construction methods treat the task as image super-resolution/generation using computer vision models, which fail to capture wireless propagation physics. Need for physically consistent CKMs in 6G environment awareness.

Method: Designs three physics-based constraint terms for large-scale fading patterns, integrates them with state-of-the-art diffusion model, derives loss function with physics constraints, and designs training/generation framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms all existing methods in construction accuracy. Provides unified framework for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKMs.

Conclusion: The physics-inspired diffusion model successfully addresses limitations of vision-based approaches by incorporating wireless propagation physics, offering strong potential for accurate CKM generation in 6G systems.

Abstract: The ability to construct Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) with high precision is essential for environment awareness in 6G wireless systems. However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, we focus on the construction of CKM for large-scale fading scenarios and design three physics-based constraint terms to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with a state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM.

*Alejandro Roig-Herrero,Luis M. San-José-Revuelta,Rafael Navarro-González,Rodrigo de Luis-García,Vicente Molina*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Brain aging acceleration in schizophrenia patients isn't primarily caused by antipsychotic medication, as shown by comparing medicated vs. non-medicated bipolar patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether accelerated brain aging in schizophrenia is progressive and whether antipsychotic medication contributes to this phenomenon, given previous findings of brain age gaps in patients.

Method: Used Brain Age paradigm with two models: 1) transformer-inspired model using harmonized volumetric brain features from FastSurfer, and 2) previously trained deep learning model. Compared first-episode psychosis patients vs healthy controls (ANCOVA with covariates), and medicated vs non-medicated bipolar patients (Mann-Whitney U test).

Result: Medicated bipolar patients did not show significantly larger Brain Age Gap compared to non-medicated patients. Both models converged on the conclusion that antipsychotic medication alone is unlikely to explain accelerated brain aging.

Conclusion: Accelerated brain aging in schizophrenia is not primarily driven by antipsychotic medication. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the temporal dynamics of brain aging in this population.

Abstract: Accelerated brain aging has been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia.

*Hefei Gao,Tianyao Huang,Letian Guo,Jie He,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction that integrates measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors, achieving significant performance improvements over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imaging faces challenges from noise, undersampling, and complex scattering. Conventional methods (matched filtering, compressed sensing) suffer from artifacts, sidelobes, and detail loss. Existing diffusion-based methods have degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework that alternately performs likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling. This integrates measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors, ensuring progressive convergence toward the true posterior while leveraging diffusion priors' expressive power.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB). On real-world Sentinel-1A data, achieves 1.6 dB average PSNR gain while reducing artifacts and preserving scene details (ridges, edges, fine textures).

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robust and generalizable high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios, overcoming limitations of conventional and existing diffusion-based methods through rigorous integration of measurement fidelity with diffusion priors.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios.

*Omar Mahmood,Pedro O. Pinheiro,Richard Bonneau,Saeed Saremi,Vishnu Sresht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VoxCap is a voxel captioning method that generates SMILES strings from voxelized molecular representations, addressing scaling and fecundity issues in conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening through de-novo design and fast search workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ligand-based drug discovery using pharmacophore-shape similarity searches scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing compounds. There's a need for more scalable and creative approaches that can generate novel molecules rather than just searching existing libraries.

Method: VoxCap: a voxel captioning method that generates SMILES strings from voxelized molecular representations. Two workflows are proposed: 1) de-novo design to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and 2) fast search combining generative design with cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification.

Result: VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse de-novo hits. When combined with the fast search workflow, it reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling search of large libraries intractable to brute force methods.

Conclusion: VoxCap addresses key limitations of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening by providing a scalable generative approach that enables both de-novo molecule design and efficient large-scale library searching, representing a significant advancement in ligand-based drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The boundary element method (BEM) is efficient for multiple scattering in unbounded domains but has computational bottlenecks in solving boundary integral equations. Learning-based approaches can accelerate this first step.

Method: PIBNet uses a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions, with a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating multiple scattering.

Result: PIBNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on multiple scattering tasks and exhibits superior generalization to settings with increased numbers of obstacles.

Conclusion: PIBNet provides an effective learning-based alternative to accelerate the computationally expensive first step of BEM for multiple scattering problems, with strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature fusion for lyrical content classification by moving beyond simple output-layer fusion and instead integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the Transformer's self-attention mechanism for better synergy between structural and semantic information.

Method: Proposes SFL Transformer with Contextual Gating mechanism (Intermediate SFL) that modulates hidden states within BERT encoder stack using low-dimensional structural features, rather than fusing at final output layer. Applied to binary classification of UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings.

Result: Achieved Accuracy 0.9910 and Macro F1 0.9910, surpassing previous SFL model (0.9894 accuracy). Maintained exceptional reliability with low Expected Calibration Error (0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

Conclusion: Injecting auxiliary structural context mid-stack is the most effective approach for combining structural and semantic information, creating models with superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ada-MoGE is an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model that dynamically adjusts the number of experts based on spectral analysis to handle shifting frequency distributions in multivariate time series forecasting, preventing information loss and noise contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE models with fixed numbers of experts struggle with evolving spectral distributions in time series data, leading to frequency coverage imbalance - too few experts overlook critical information while too many introduce noise.

Method: Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the optimal number of experts. It uses Gaussian band-pass filtering for smooth frequency domain feature decomposition instead of direct band truncation to prevent noise introduction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Ada-MoGE successfully addresses the frequency coverage imbalance in time series forecasting by adaptively adjusting expert numbers based on spectral analysis, providing an efficient solution for handling evolving frequency distributions.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic complexity and overfit sparse data, linear models can't capture non-linear dynamics, and existing multi-scale frameworks lose high-frequency information through average pooling.

Method: Uses Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid for orthogonal decomposition, Dual-Path Trend Mixer with global linear mapping and patch-based MLP-Mixer, and adaptive multi-scale fusion weighted by channel stationarity.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DPWMixer provides an efficient solution for LTSF by addressing spectral aliasing and information loss while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: HTG-GCL leverages graph transformations to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes representing topological granularity, creates diverse topological views, and uses multi-granularity decoupled contrast with granularity-specific weighting based on uncertainty estimation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate HTG-GCL's effectiveness and superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Conclusion: HTG-GCL successfully addresses the limitations of existing GCL approaches by introducing hierarchical topological granularity and uncertainty-based weighting, enabling better adaptation to varying topological requirements across different tasks.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses key challenges in multi-modal federated learning by ensuring feature extraction centers on improving downstream regression performance through multi-constraint learning that handles non-IID data, multi-modal fusion, and catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Aheer Sravon,Md. Ibrahim,Devdyuti Mazumder,Ridwan Al Aziz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Four pricing algorithms (Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, DDPG) analyzed across three duopoly models under stochastic demand shocks, revealing DDPG's strong collusive tendencies and varying market responses to demand uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous pricing algorithms significantly impact digital market competition, but their behavior under realistic demand conditions with uncertainty remains poorly understood, creating a need for systematic analysis.

Method: Analyzed four pricing algorithms across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes, using profit- and price-based collusion indices.

Result: Reinforcement-learning algorithms sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand (DDPG most collusive). Demand shocks have varied effects: Logit markets decline, Hotelling remains stable, Linear markets experience profit inflation. Algorithm rankings remain consistent across environments.

Conclusion: Market structure and demand uncertainty critically shape algorithmic competition outcomes, with important implications for policy discussions on autonomous pricing behavior in digital markets.

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

*Yuxuan Shu,Peter H. Charlton,Fahim Kawsar,Jussi Hernesniemi,Mohammad Malekzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEF: A clinical-guided contrastive learning framework for single-lead ECG foundation models that uses clinical risk scores to weight negative pairs, outperforming existing self-supervised methods and matching supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised ECG foundation models don't incorporate clinical domain knowledge from metadata, limiting their diagnostic performance despite the availability of clinical risk scores and metadata in ECG recordings.

Method: Clinical-guided contrastive learning that uses established clinical risk scores to adaptively weight negative pairs, aligning ECG embedding similarities with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with explicit handling of missing metadata. Pretrained on 12-lead ECGs from 161K MIMIC-IV patients.

Result: CLEF outperforms 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms on 18 clinical tasks across 7 datasets: medium CLEF achieves ≥2.6% AUROC improvement in classification and ≥3.2% MAE reduction in regression. When pretrained on lead-I only, matches supervised state-of-the-art ECGFounder.

Conclusion: CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis by incorporating clinical metadata into self-supervised learning, advancing remote health monitoring capabilities with publicly available models.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSAE introduces ordered sparse autoencoders that establish strict feature ordering and deterministic dimension usage to improve consistency across seeds/hyperparameters compared to prior nested SAE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders are widely used for neural network interpretability, but their learned features often vary across different seeds and hyperparameter settings, making consistent interpretation difficult.

Method: Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE) extend Matryoshka SAEs by: (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features, and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods.

Result: Theoretically, OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in sparse dictionary learning settings where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically, OSAEs improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M models.

Conclusion: OSAE provides a more consistent and deterministic approach to sparse autoencoder-based interpretability by addressing feature ordering and dimension usage issues in prior methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Doughnut framework is popular for assessing sustainability, but there's a need to demonstrate how machine learning can be practically applied to find policies that achieve both environmental and social sustainability within this framework.

Method: Applied frugal ML methods (Random Forest Classifier and Q-learning) to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut framework to: 1) find policy parameters consistent with 'living within the Doughnut', and 2) identify optimal trajectories toward desired policies in parameter space.

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model capable of generating realistic synthetic sperm whale codas for research purposes, enabling better study of whale communication without requiring extensive field recordings.

Method: Finetuned VampNet (masked acoustic token model pretrained on music) using 10k coda recordings collected over 20 years, using iterative masked token prediction to generate synthetic codas.

Result: Generated high-fidelity synthetic codas preserving key acoustic features; achieved strong performance on downstream classification tasks (rhythm, social unit, vowel classification) despite being trained for generation.

Conclusion: WhAM successfully generates realistic sperm whale codas and learns useful representations for classification tasks, providing a valuable tool for marine bioacoustics research.

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructLR: A framework for generating high-quality instruction datasets for low-resource languages using LLM-driven generation with dual-layer quality filtering (automated RAG-based filtering + human validation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with low-resource languages due to lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Existing methods like automated translation and synthetic data generation produce outputs that lack fluency and orthographic consistency, particularly affecting African languages and other regions.

Method: InstructLR integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: 1) automated filtering using retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and 2) human-in-the-loop validation layer. Inspired by MMLU benchmarks for task definition.

Result: Created three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k, each containing 50,000 high-quality instruction examples for these low-resource languages.

Conclusion: InstructLR provides an effective framework for generating high-quality instruction datasets for low-resource languages, addressing the data scarcity problem that hinders LLM performance in these languages.

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

*Krishnendu S. Tharakan,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMTFL-based caching system for wireless VR that personalizes FOV prefetching at base stations using decentralized multi-task federated learning to handle statistical heterogeneity across users and locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless VR requires seamless, high-quality real-time video delivery but faces challenges from stringent latency requirements, QoE demands, and limited device capabilities. Traditional federated learning approaches suffer from bias toward certain users and fail to capture statistical heterogeneity across users and base stations.

Method: Proposes a decentralized multi-task fair federated learning (DMTFL) algorithm that learns individual caching models at each base station. The approach personalizes content delivery by caching and prefetching each VR user's field of view (FOV) with strategies tailored to each BS. Provides theoretical guarantees using Rademacher complexity and PAC bounds.

Result: Simulations using realistic VR head-tracking dataset demonstrate superiority of the proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms for wireless VR content delivery.

Conclusion: DMTFL-based caching effectively addresses wireless VR challenges by providing personalized, fair content delivery with theoretical performance guarantees, outperforming existing approaches in handling statistical heterogeneity across users and base stations.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

*Benjamin K. Rosenzweig,Matthew W. Hahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can learn phylogenetic distance functions that approximate classic methods, offering scalability and comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art inference with smaller computational footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phylogenetic inference methods (Bayesian and maximum likelihood) are computationally intensive and don't scale well to large datasets. There's a need for more efficient approaches that can handle large numbers of taxa and molecular characters while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Develop minimal neural network architectures that learn phylogenetic distance functions under various molecular evolutionary models. These networks are designed to be computationally lightweight and scalable, contrasting with complex model-based methods and recent deep learning approaches.

Result: The learned distance functions generalize well and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art inference methods when given appropriate training data. They maintain accuracy while being more scalable to large datasets.

Conclusion: Minimal neural network architectures offer a promising alternative for phylogenetic distance estimation, providing the scalability needed for modern large-scale phylogenetic analyses while maintaining competitive accuracy with traditional methods.

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

TL;DR: Using adversarial wireless jamming to regularize autoencoder latent space to match diagonal Gaussian distribution, achieving comparable distribution matching to VAE/WAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel approach for distribution matching in autoencoder latent spaces using adversarial jamming as regularization, inspired by theoretical results about minimax games involving jammers in wireless communication.

Method: Proposes using adversarial wireless jamming as auxiliary objective to regularize latent space. Formulates minimax game between encoder-decoder pair and adversarial jammer, where jammer tries to disrupt recovery of Gaussian source. Theoretical result shows saddle point consists of diagonal Gaussian noise from jammer, which inspires using jamming to encourage aggregated latent posterior to match diagonal Gaussian distribution.

Result: Achieves distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders (VAE) and Wasserstein autoencoders (WAE). Approach can be generalized to other latent distributions beyond diagonal Gaussian.

Conclusion: Adversarial jamming provides effective regularization for distribution matching in autoencoder latent spaces, offering a novel alternative to existing methods like VAE and WAE with potential for generalization to various latent distributions.

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

### [146] [The Effect of Enforcing Fairness on Reshaping Explanations in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02265)
*Joshua Wolff Anderson,Shyam Visweswaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairness improvements in ML models can significantly alter feature importance explanations, potentially undermining clinical trust when explanations shift unexpectedly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare ML needs predictive performance, fairness, and explainability, but little is known about how fairness improvements affect explainability. Clinicians may distrust models whose explanations change after fairness constraints are applied.

Method: Examined how fairness bias mitigation techniques reshape Shapley-based feature rankings across three datasets (pediatric UTI risk, anticoagulant bleeding risk, recidivism risk). Evaluated multiple model classes on stability of Shapley-based rankings after fairness constraints.

Result: Increasing model fairness across racial subgroups significantly alters feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. Fairness improvements can substantially change which features are considered most important.

Conclusion: Accuracy, fairness, and explainability must be jointly considered in model assessment rather than in isolation, as fairness improvements can meaningfully change explanations that clinicians rely on for trust.

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

### [147] [Limitations of Membership Queries in Testable Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02279)
*Jane Lange,Mingda Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Membership queries cannot significantly speed up testable learning beyond sample-only learning, and efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether membership queries can provide computational speedups in the testable learning model, where learners must verify distribution properties before outputting hypotheses.

Method: Reduction from sample-based refutation to testable learning with queries (TL-Q), connecting TL-Q lower bounds to PAC learning complexity. Also defines "statistical" MQ algorithms and shows they imply efficient statistical-query refutation.

Result: No m-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best m-sample PAC learner. Efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable due to SQ dimension lower bounds.

Conclusion: Membership queries do not provide significant computational advantages in testable learning beyond what's achievable with samples alone, and efficient MQ learners are inherently incompatible with testability requirements.

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Adapt-TKM, an efficient transfer learning method using tensor kernel machines that transfers knowledge via regularization, requiring 100x fewer parameters than adaptive SVM for faster inference on wearable devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning can optimize target task performance by leveraging related source problems, but existing methods like adaptive SVM can be parameter-heavy and inefficient for resource-constrained applications like wearable EEG devices.

Method: Adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) that uses low-rank tensor networks to learn compact non-linear models in primal domain, transferring knowledge from source to target via regularization without adding parameters.

Result: Applied to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG, Adapt-TKM achieves better performance than patient-independent and fully patient-specific models while requiring ~100x fewer parameters than adaptive SVM, enabling faster inference.

Conclusion: Adapt-TKM provides an efficient transfer learning approach particularly suitable for resource-constrained wearable devices by combining knowledge transfer with parameter efficiency through tensor kernel machines.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

### [149] [Training Dynamics of Learning 3D-Rotational Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02303)
*Max W. Shen,Ewa Nowara,Michael Maser,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Models learn 3D rotational equivariance quickly (≤2% error within 1k-10k steps) because it's easier than the main prediction task, with equivariant models only being better if they overcome computational efficiency gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quickly symmetry-agnostic models learn to respect symmetries through data augmentation, and to quantify equivariance error in a principled way.

Method: Derived a principled measure of equivariance error for convex losses, then empirically investigated 3D-rotation equivariance on molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels).

Result: Models reduce equivariance error quickly to ≤2% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, robust to model and dataset size. Learning 3D-rotational equivariance has smoother, better-conditioned loss landscape than main prediction task.

Conclusion: For 3D rotations, non-equivariant models may outperform equivariant ones computationally unless efficiency gaps are narrowed, as the loss penalty for non-equivariance is small throughout training.

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

### [150] [Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323)
*Kentaro Kubo,Hayato Goto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SAL framework combining Langevin SB sampler and CEM for efficient training of general Boltzmann machines beyond restricted models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Boltzmann machines are powerful but computationally expensive to train, especially for models beyond Restricted BMs. MCMC Boltzmann sampling is accurate but slow due to parallelization difficulties.

Method: Develops Langevin SB (LSB) sampler inspired by quantum-inspired simulated bifurcation for parallelizable Boltzmann sampling. Also creates conditional expectation matching (CEM) to estimate inverse temperature during learning. Combines both into sampler-adaptive learning (SAL) framework.

Result: LSB enables parallel sampling with accuracy comparable to MCMC, applicable to general BMs. CEM addresses temperature control limitations. SAL provides efficient learning framework for more expressive BMs.

Conclusion: SAL framework enables practical training of general Boltzmann machines, expanding energy-based generative modeling beyond Restricted BMs with efficient parallel sampling and temperature control.

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAM-OL extends SGD with a small memory buffer for retrieval-augmented online learning under concept drift, improving accuracy on periodic streams while matching baseline on noisy streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented models combine parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their application to streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. The paper aims to address how such models can handle non-stationary environments in online classification tasks.

Method: Proposes RAM-OL (Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, it retrieves nearest neighbors of the current input in hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on current example and retrieved neighbors. Two variants: naive replay and gated replay (with time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting constraints).

Result: On strongly and periodically drifting streams (electricity pricing and load data), RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to ~7 percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds. On noisy airline delay stream, gated variant closely matches purely online baseline. Theoretical analysis shows retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift, effectively balancing fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

*Sai Siddharth Nalamalpu,Kaining Yuan,Aiden Zhou,Eugene Pinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares statistical and machine learning models for predicting Boston MBTA subway usage (via station entries) and system delays, finding that temporal features (day of week, season) are more important than weather data for prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MBTA public transit system in Boston faces frequent delays and ridership fluctuations that negatively impact efficiency and passenger satisfaction. There's a need to better understand and predict these patterns to improve system performance.

Method: The research evaluates 10 statistical and machine learning models for predicting next-day subway usage (using gated station entries as proxy) and 11 models for predicting delay counts, including a unique self-exciting point process model. Features considered include day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. The study experiments with selective feature inclusion to determine importance and tests model accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Result: Temporal features (day of week or season) provide more substantial benefits to predictive accuracy compared to weather data. Surprisingly, including weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting models tend to overfit when weather features are included.

Conclusion: For predicting MBTA subway usage and delays, focusing on temporal patterns (day of week and season) yields better results than incorporating weather data. The unique application of a self-exciting point process model for delay prediction represents a novel approach to MBTA delay modeling.

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

*Zhendong Tan,Xingjun Zhang,Chaoyi Hu,Junjie Peng,Kun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecPV accelerates long-context LLM generation using self-speculative decoding with partial KV state verification and periodic full verification, achieving up to 6x speedup with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context generation is crucial for tasks like code generation and document understanding, but speculative decoding faces bottlenecks in verification as context length grows.

Method: SpecPV uses self-speculative decoding with partial key-value state verification for fast processing, combined with periodic full verification to correct accumulated errors.

Result: Achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation across multiple long-context benchmarks and models including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series.

Conclusion: SpecPV effectively addresses the verification bottleneck in long-context speculative decoding, providing significant acceleration while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOVA is a vote-based offline federated reinforcement learning framework that addresses performance degradation with mixed-quality data by using a vote mechanism to identify high-return actions and consistent AWR-based objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline FRL methods suffer dramatic performance drops when dealing with mixed-quality data (data collected by policies with varying qualities across clients), creating a need for more robust approaches.

Method: FOVA introduces a vote mechanism to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, mitigating negative effects of low-quality behaviors. It builds on advantage-weighted regression (AWR) to construct consistent local and global training objectives.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over behavioral policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: FOVA effectively addresses the mixed-quality data challenge in offline FRL through its vote mechanism and consistent AWR-based objectives, achieving superior performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

*Jonathan Baxter,Peter L. Bartlett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPOMDP is a gradient-based algorithm for optimizing policy performance in POMDPs that estimates gradient of average reward using single sample paths, one free parameter for bias-variance tradeoff, and requires no state knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient gradient-based optimization methods for policy performance in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that overcome limitations of existing approaches by requiring minimal information and computational resources.

Method: Introduces GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm that estimates gradient of average reward using only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, with one free parameter β ∈ [0,1) controlling bias-variance tradeoff, and requiring no knowledge of underlying state.

Result: Proves convergence of GPOMDP algorithm and demonstrates how its gradient estimates can be used in conjugate-gradient procedures to find local optima of average reward in controlled POMDPs.

Conclusion: GPOMDP provides an efficient, practical approach for direct policy optimization in POMDPs with minimal requirements, offering theoretical guarantees and practical utility for finding locally optimal policies.

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

TL;DR: The paper develops a risk-sensitive q-learning algorithm for continuous-time reinforcement learning with nonlinear reward functionals, proving optimal policies are Markovian and demonstrating effectiveness in portfolio selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL often uses expected cumulative rewards, but many real-world applications require risk-sensitive decision-making. Continuous-time environments with stochastic differential equations and nonlinear reward functionals present theoretical and algorithmic challenges that need to be addressed.

Method: The paper proves that with optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) functionals, optimal policies are Markovian in an augmented environment. It proposes CT-RS-q, a risk-sensitive q-learning algorithm based on a novel martingale characterization approach.

Result: Theoretical results establish Markovian optimal policies for OCE functionals. The CT-RS-q algorithm is developed and validated through simulation studies on dynamic portfolio selection problems, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper provides both theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for risk-sensitive RL in continuous time, addressing important challenges in decision-making under uncertainty with nonlinear reward structures.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) in continuous time, where the environment is characterized by a controllable stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the objective is a potentially nonlinear functional of cumulative rewards. We prove that when the functional is an optimized certainty equivalent (OCE), the optimal policy is Markovian with respect to an augmented environment. We also propose \textit{CT-RS-q}, a risk-sensitive q-learning algorithm based on a novel martingale characterization approach. Finally, we run a simulation study on a dynamic portfolio selection problem and illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

*Hongxiang Liu,Zhifang Deng,Tong Pu,Shengli Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESACT is an end-to-end sparse accelerator for Transformers that uses local similarity prediction to reduce computation by 52% with minimal accuracy loss, achieving 3.29 TOPS/W energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have high computational costs that hinder hardware deployment. Existing sparse accelerators mainly exploit intra-row sparsity in attention, with few considering inter-row sparsity. Approaches using inter-row sparsity rely on costly global similarity estimation, reducing acceleration benefits, and typically only apply sparsity to 1-2 transformer components.

Method: Proposes ESACT with Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism that uses HLog quantization to predict local attention sparsity before QK generation. Includes three architectural innovations for efficient hardware realization, enabling sparsity across all transformer components with lower computational overhead.

Result: SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with <1% accuracy loss on 26 benchmarks. ESACT achieves 3.29 TOPS/W end-to-end energy efficiency, improving attention-level efficiency by 2.95x over SpAtten and 2.26x over Sanger.

Conclusion: Local similarity enables efficient end-to-end sparse acceleration for Transformers. ESACT demonstrates significant computation reduction and energy efficiency improvements over state-of-the-art accelerators through its SPLS mechanism and architectural innovations.

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

*Oshada Jayasinghe,Farhana Choudhury,Egemen Tanin,Shanika Karunasekera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic on-street parking space configuration using multi-agent reinforcement learning reduces traffic congestion by optimizing parking allocation in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion worsened by on-street parking limiting road width; need to minimize parking's impact on traffic flow using vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies.

Method: Two-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning framework: lane-level agents optimize parking configurations using novel Deep Q-learning with LSTM and graph attention networks; block-level agents coordinate lane agents to maintain sufficient parking.

Result: Reduces average travel time loss up to 47% with negligible increase in walking distance for parking, validated on synthetic and real-world Melbourne data using SUMO.

Conclusion: Dynamic parking space configuration via multi-agent RL effectively reduces traffic congestion while maintaining parking availability, scalable to large urban networks.

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

*Yizhou Zhang,Lun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data curation methods like pruning and synthetic data generation have varying effectiveness - static pruning provides limited improvements while ideal time-dependent curation can accelerate learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some data-centric strategies (pruning, synthetic data, RLHF, etc.) improve training efficiency while others fail, and to formalize data curation's effect on neural scaling laws.

Method: Formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and analyze its effect on the eigenstructure of data-induced operators. Analyze both static pruning and time-dependent curation mathematically.

Result: 1) Static pruning induces bounded operators and cannot change spectral tail exponents, providing only finite-region improvements. 2) Ideal time-dependent curation (tracking spectral residuals) can provably accelerate learning, though practical systems only approximate this.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of data curation depends on whether it can alter the spectral structure of data - static methods have fundamental limitations while dynamic methods with spectral awareness can accelerate learning.

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVDF method selectively filters source domain data using both dynamics and value alignment for cross-domain offline RL, outperforming prior methods across various tasks and low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-domain offline RL methods focus only on dynamics alignment and overlook value alignment (selecting high-quality, high-value samples). Both are essential for policy learning, as shown by theoretical analysis revealing limitations in existing frameworks and sub-optimality gaps.

Method: Proposes Dynamics- and Value-aligned Data Filtering (DVDF) method that selectively shares source domain samples with both high dynamics alignment and high value alignment. The approach filters data based on both criteria rather than just dynamics matching.

Result: DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines across various tasks and datasets, including challenging low-data settings where target domain contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate exceptional performance across multiple dynamics shift settings (kinematic and morphology shifts).

Conclusion: Both dynamics and value alignment are crucial for effective cross-domain offline RL. The proposed DVDF method successfully addresses this by filtering source domain data using both criteria, leading to superior performance compared to methods that only consider dynamics alignment.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

*Tsimur Hadeliya,Mohammad Ali Jauhar,Nidhi Sakpal,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM agents show unexpected performance degradation and inconsistent safety refusal rates when operating on long contexts (100K+ tokens), revealing safety issues in agentic setups that differ from standard LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While new LLMs support longer context windows and tool calling for complex tasks, prior work has mainly evaluated LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setups relatively unexplored from both capability and safety perspectives.

Method: The study evaluates LLM agents on long-horizon tasks with extended context windows, examining performance degradation and refusal rate changes across different context lengths, types, and placements.

Result: LLM agents show severe performance degradation (exceeding 50% drops) at 100K tokens even for models with 1M-2M context windows. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from ~5% to ~40% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from ~80% to ~10% at 200K tokens.

Conclusion: The work reveals potential safety issues with agents operating on longer contexts and questions current evaluation metrics for LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks, showing divergence in capability and safety performance compared to prior LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show strong implicit pro-altruism bias and behave altruistically above chance, but their implicit associations don't predict behavior, and they systematically overestimate their own altruism (virtue signaling gap).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs exhibit altruistic tendencies and whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior, using methods from human social psychology.

Method: Tested 24 frontier LLMs using three paradigms: Implicit Association Test (IAT) for implicit altruism bias, forced binary choice task for behavioral altruism, and self-assessment scale for explicit altruism beliefs.

Result: All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias; behave altruistically above chance (65.6% vs 50%); implicit associations don't predict behavior; models systematically overestimate their altruism (77.5% claimed vs 65.6% actual) - "virtue signaling gap" affecting 75% of models.

Conclusion: Proposes Calibration Gap as standardized alignment metric; only 12.5% of models achieve ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge; well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global urbanization and extreme weather events require high-resolution urban rainfall monitoring. Traditional physics-based models for Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation.

Method: TabGRU: Hybrid deep learning architecture combining Transformer and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to capture both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in CML signal data. Enhanced with learnable positional embedding and attention pooling mechanism.

Result: Achieved high coefficients of determination (R²): 0.91 at Torp site and 0.96 at Barl site. Outperformed deep learning baselines and physics-based approaches, effectively mitigating overestimation problems during peak rainfall events.

Conclusion: TabGRU model effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods, providing robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under tested conditions.

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

TL;DR: DROCO introduces dual robustness for cross-domain offline RL, addressing both train-time and test-time dynamics shifts through a robust Bellman operator and value stabilization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain offline RL focuses only on train-time robustness against dynamics shifts in training data, but neglects test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations during deployment, especially when target domain data is limited.

Method: Proposes Robust Cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator for test-time robustness while maintaining train-time conservatism. Adds dynamic value penalty and Huber loss to prevent value overestimation/underestimation, resulting in DROCO algorithm.

Result: DROCO outperforms strong baselines across various dynamics shift scenarios and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations during evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the dual robustness challenge in cross-domain offline RL, providing both train-time and test-time protection against dynamics shifts through novel algorithmic components.

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a first-order method for computing gradients in differentiable optimization layers, avoiding expensive Hessian computations while matching state-of-the-art complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable optimization layers are valuable for learning systems but current gradient computation via implicit differentiation requires solving linear systems with Hessian terms, which is computationally expensive in both time and memory.

Method: Reformulates differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and introduces an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that uses only first-order information, avoiding Hessian evaluations while providing finite-time approximation guarantees.

Result: Achieves $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time for approximate hypergradient computation and overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, matching best known rates for non-smooth non-convex optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed first-order method enables efficient gradient computation for differentiable optimization layers without Hessian evaluations, with theoretical guarantees and practical implementation available as open-source Python library.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

TL;DR: In-context distillation enables cost-effective LLM agent deployment by using teacher demonstrations to guide cheaper student models, achieving 2.5× cost reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agent deployment at scale incurs high inference costs, but existing solutions like fine-tuning or manual prompt engineering introduce significant development friction and slow down rapid prototyping cycles.

Method: Proposes in-context distillation that retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step to guide a cheaper student model, combined with self-consistency cascades to determine when to trust the student's outputs.

Result: On ALFWorld, achieves teacher-level accuracy at 2.5× lower cost (from $0.059 to $0.024 per episode), with upfront costs amortizing after 843 episodes. On AppWorld, achieves 2× cost reduction at iso-accuracy, shifting the Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: The approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable by reducing operational costs while preserving rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, enabling broader application deployment.

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Feature Learning (FL) model that efficiently learns hyperparameters for tensor-product features using Canonical Polyadic Decomposition and Alternating Least Squares optimization, achieving 3-5x faster training than standard cross-validation with comparable prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While tensor network reparameterization has addressed the curse of dimensionality in kernel approximations using tensor-product features, the important problem of identifying optimal feature hyperparameters remains unsolved and is typically handled through inefficient cross-validation approaches.

Method: The FL model represents tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, the model efficiently learns hyperparameters associated with different features alongside model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method.

Result: Experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than standard cross-validated models while maintaining comparable prediction quality.

Conclusion: The FL model provides an efficient solution for learning optimal feature hyperparameters in kernel approximations, overcoming the limitations of standard cross-validation approaches and enabling faster training without sacrificing prediction performance.

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even heavily-optimized performance-critical kernels like HGEMM can potentially be improved through automated optimization, as manual optimization is limited in exploring vast configuration spaces.

Method: Combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) with CUDA execution speed as the reward signal to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels across 1,000 configurations.

Conclusion: LLM-guided RL automation can systematically explore configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans, demonstrating that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels can be improved through automated optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GoRL separates optimization from generation in RL by using a tractable latent policy with a conditional generative decoder, achieving stable learning and expressive multimodal action distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental tension in RL: Gaussian policies are stable to optimize but limited in expressiveness (unimodal), while generative policies (diffusion/flow matching) are expressive but unstable in online RL due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients.

Method: GoRL decouples optimization from generation using a tractable latent policy optimized with stable gradients, paired with a conditional generative decoder that synthesizes actions. A two-timescale update schedule allows the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder gradually increases expressiveness without requiring tractable action likelihoods.

Result: GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines across continuous-control tasks. On HopperStand, it achieves normalized return above 870, more than 3 times the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: Separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive, addressing the fundamental tension in RL between optimization stability and representational capacity.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heat transfer in chip-substrate assemblies involves steep interfacial temperature gradients due to property mismatches. Conventional numerical methods require excessive discretization, while PINNs often fail near interfaces with unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency.

Method: HeatTransFormer integrates: 1) physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, 2) Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and 3) mask-free attention mechanism for bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. Also includes physics-constrained inverse strategy for property identification.

Result: The model produces coherent temperature fields across interfaces, maintains physical consistency, and remains stable where PINNs typically fail. It enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements.

Conclusion: Physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for both forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems, overcoming limitations of conventional numerical methods and PINNs.

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent effectively addresses VLN agent limitations through dual-view visual prompting and novel step-level reinforcement fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: F2D2 is a framework that jointly distills both sampling and likelihood evaluation in flow-based models, reducing neural function evaluations by two orders of magnitude while maintaining accurate log-likelihood computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion and flow-based models require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) for likelihood computation, creating a computational bottleneck. While distillation methods accelerate sampling, they sacrifice likelihood tractability or still require expensive integration.

Method: F2D2 leverages the insight that in continuous normalizing flows, sampling and likelihood ODEs share a common velocity field. The framework jointly distills both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model with an additional divergence prediction head, making it modular and compatible with existing few-step sampling models.

Result: F2D2 achieves accurate log-likelihood evaluation with few-step NFEs while maintaining high sample quality. It enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024-step teacher model with only one additional backward NFE through lightweight self-guidance.

Conclusion: F2D2 solves the long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models by enabling efficient joint distillation of sampling and likelihood evaluation, opening up practical applications for model comparison, fine-tuning, and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

Motivation: Existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods lack explicit collaboration types across views or use co-regularization that limits global collaboration. There's a need for better multi-view integration that promotes complementary learning while maintaining feature isolation for privacy-preserving scenarios.

Method: AW-LSSVM (Adaptive Weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machine) uses iterative global coupling where each view focuses on hard samples from other views from previous iterations. This promotes complementary learning while keeping raw features isolated.

Result: AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods on most datasets tested, demonstrating superior performance while maintaining feature isolation.

Conclusion: The proposed AW-LSSVM effectively promotes complementary learning through iterative global coupling, achieving better performance than existing methods while being suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios due to feature isolation.

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

### [176] [Distill, Forget, Repeat: A Framework for Continual Unlearning in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02657)
*Naveen George,Naoki Murata,Yuhta Takida,Konda Reddy Mopuri,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for continual unlearning in generative models that addresses sequential deletion requests without catastrophic forgetting, using generative distillation to maintain model stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data privacy regulations (like GDPR's Right to be Forgotten) require removing specific concepts from generative models, but existing unlearning methods fail when deletion requests arrive sequentially, causing stability crises and performance degradation.

Method: Generative distillation-based continual unlearning framework that treats each unlearning step as multi-objective teacher-student distillation, leveraging continual learning principles to maintain model integrity across sequential deletion requests.

Result: Experiments on 10-step sequential benchmark show the method successfully unlearns target concepts with better fidelity while preserving performance on retained concepts and overall image quality, substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for responsible deployment of large-scale generative models, enabling compliance with ongoing data removal requests while maintaining model stability and performance.

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

*Haozhuo Zheng,Cheng Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GVT is a two-stage graph generative model that compresses molecular graphs into discrete latent sequences using a Graph VQ-VAE, then generates them via autoregressive Transformer, achieving SOTA performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models are computationally intensive for molecular generation, while autoregressive models suffer from error propagation issues. There's a need for an efficient yet accurate generative framework for molecules.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Graph VQ-VAE compresses molecular graphs into discrete latent sequences using Graph Transformer with RCM node ordering and RoPE embeddings, 2) Autoregressive Transformer generates these discrete sequences, converting graph generation into sequence modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol benchmarks. Outperforms leading diffusion models on key metrics like FCD and KL Divergence with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: GVT presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models, establishes a strong baseline for discrete latent-space molecular generation, and bridges molecular design with large-scale sequence modeling paradigms for potential LLM synergies.

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

TL;DR: Proposes entropy-constrained conformal correction to improve CP efficiency while controlling prediction entropy, achieving up to 34.4% efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction provides statistically rigorous uncertainty sets, but there's a need to improve its efficiency. While conformal correction helps fine-tune models for better efficiency, there exists a trade-off between CP efficiency and prediction entropy that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes an entropy-constrained conformal correction method that explores better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. The method fine-tunes or wraps base models with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss while constraining prediction entropy.

Result: Extensive experiments on computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate significant efficiency improvements - up to 34.4% better than state-of-the-art CP methods while maintaining entropy constraints.

Conclusion: The entropy-constrained conformal correction method effectively addresses the efficiency-entropy trade-off in conformal prediction, achieving substantial efficiency gains while controlling prediction entropy, making it a valuable enhancement to existing CP frameworks.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Motivation: Existing graph-based anomaly detection models overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability.

Method: Proposes FGC-Comp: partitions neighbors into three label-based groups, applies group-specific transforms to labeled groups while using node-conditioned gate for unknowns, fuses messages via residual connections, and trains end-to-end with binary classification objective.

Result: Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: FGC-Comp is a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly solution that improves aggregation stability and prediction reliability under incomplete node attributes.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification approaches for GNNs rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles, but there's a need for more reliable uncertainty estimation, especially under out-of-distribution conditions and on heterophilic graphs.

Method: Introduce credal graph neural networks (CGNNs) that train GNNs to output set-valued predictions as credal sets, with a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation during message passing.

Result: CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs. Analysis reveals the critical role of graph homophily assumption in shaping uncertainty estimate effectiveness.

Conclusion: CGNNs provide an effective approach for uncertainty quantification in GNNs, particularly valuable for handling distributional shifts and heterophilic graph structures where traditional assumptions may not hold.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates.

TL;DR: FiMMIA is a modular framework for multimodal membership inference attacks that addresses distribution shifts in MLLMs and extends perturbation-based methods to multimodal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference methods perform poorly on multimodal LLMs due to instabilities from multimodal component adaptation and distribution shifts across multiple inputs.

Method: 1) Identify distribution shifts in existing datasets, 2) Release extended baseline pipeline for detection, 3) Generalize perturbation-based membership inference to MLLMs, 4) Train neural network to analyze target model's behavior on perturbed inputs to capture distributional differences between members and non-members.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Conclusion: FiMMIA provides an effective framework for multimodal membership inference that addresses the unique challenges of MLLMs, with publicly available code and framework.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members.

TL;DR: Flow-based diffusion models exhibit a two-stage training dynamic: early stage generalizes across data modes for global layouts, later stage memorizes fine-grained details from nearest samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the memorization-generalization behavior of flow-based diffusion models, which remains poorly understood despite their success in generative modeling for images and videos.

Method: Revisit flow matching objective and analyze its marginal velocity field, which admits closed-form expression allowing exact computation of oracle FM target. Study reveals inherent two-stage training target structure.

Result: Analysis shows flow-based diffusion models formulate two-stage training: early stage guided by mixture of data modes (generalization), later stage dominated by nearest data sample (memorization). This explains effectiveness of practical techniques like timestep-shifted schedules and classifier-free guidance intervals.

Conclusion: The study deepens understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements in flow-based generative models.

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REVIN normalization is the most efficient approach for Time-Series Foundation Models, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89% vs un-normalized baseline and 44% vs other methods, while maintaining in-domain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization is well-studied for dataset-specific time-series models but overlooked in Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) where generalization across domains is critical. Time-series data exhibits significant scale variation across domains/channels and non-stationarity, which can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity.

Method: Systematic evaluation of input normalization methods across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, comparing REVIN against other normalization approaches and un-normalized baselines.

Result: REVIN achieved the best results: 89% reduction in zero-shot MASE relative to un-normalized baseline, 44% reduction versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing. REVIN provides the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: REVIN is the most efficient normalization approach for TSFMs, but its effectiveness depends on architectural design choices and optimization objectives, particularly regarding training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

TL;DR: GraphMatch is a recommendation framework combining pre-trained language models with graph neural networks for text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplaces, outperforming language-only and graph-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommending matches in text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplaces is challenging due to evolving content and interaction graphs. Existing approaches using standalone models don't effectively handle both fine-grained text semantics and time-sensitive graph structure.

Method: GraphMatch fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks, using adversarial negative sampling and point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both evolving text semantics and time-sensitive graph structure. The framework is designed for low-latency inference suitable for real-time use.

Result: Extensive evaluation on Upwork labor marketplace data shows GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. The framework demonstrates effectiveness at large scale.

Conclusion: Unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution for text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained language models and large-scale graphs in practice.

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive DFL (aDFL) with adaptive learning rate adjustment to mitigate abnormal client impact without requiring large normal client numbers or prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFL methods for handling abnormal clients require either sufficiently large numbers of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which limits practical applicability.

Method: Develops adaptive DFL (aDFL) that adaptively adjusts client learning rates - assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients to mitigate negative impact of abnormal clients.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows oracle property without stringent conditions on neighboring nodes or prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: aDFL provides a fully adaptive approach for robust decentralized federated learning that overcomes limitations of previous methods by adaptively adjusting client learning rates based on client behavior.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outer loop tasks like optimization and uncertainty quantification become intractable with expensive high-fidelity models, and data-driven methods need large datasets. Multi-fidelity approaches address these challenges by leveraging inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting with limited high-fidelity data.

Method: Multi-fidelity neural networks learn input-to-output mappings by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity solutions. Investigated various architectures (MLP, Siren, KAN), coordinate encoding mechanisms, exact/learnable low-fidelity information, and varying training dataset sizes across diverse function types.

Result: Performance analysis conducted for low/high-dimensional functions, oscillatory functions, functions with discontinuities, models with equal/dissimilar parametrization, and potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources across numerous architectural and dataset configurations.

Conclusion: The study quantifies performance gains of multi-fidelity approaches through equivalent single-fidelity comparisons, demonstrating the value of fusing multiple information sources for efficient emulation of expensive computational models.

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time policy optimization methods for LLMs use fixed-budget majority voting, which creates substantial computational redundancy by generating unnecessary rollouts. There's a need for more efficient allocation of inference resources during adaptation.

Method: OptPO formulates the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, dynamically halting sampling once posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a threshold.

Result: Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. It offers computational efficiency for test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: OptPO provides a principled framework that unifies statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, offering a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation of LLMs through optimal rollout allocation.

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairy2i converts pre-trained real-valued LLMs to complex-valued form for extreme low-bit quantization (down to 2 bits) while maintaining performance, enabling efficient inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require aggressive quantization for efficiency, but complex-valued models (which offer better low-bit representation) need training from scratch, preventing use of existing pre-trained real-valued models. There's a need to bridge complex-valued efficiency with pre-trained model utility.

Method: 1) Proves mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear complex maps, enabling conversion of pre-trained Transformers to complex domain. 2) Uses phase-aware quantization with fourth roots of unity codebook. 3) Introduces recursive residual quantization to minimize error. 4) Enables multiplication-free accumulation during inference.

Result: Fairy2i restores LLaMA-2 7B performance at effective 2-bit precision to near full-precision levels, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods.

Conclusion: The framework bridges complex-valued arithmetic efficiency with practical utility of pre-trained models, enabling efficient inference on commodity hardware without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed minimax hypothesis testing framework for generalized Thurstone models in pairwise comparison data, establishing optimal testing thresholds and error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for Thurstone models, but lacked fundamental hypothesis testing framework to determine if data actually follows these models.

Method: Introduced separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and Thurstone models; derived upper/lower bounds on testing thresholds; proposed hypothesis test with confidence intervals; used reverse martingale techniques for time-uniform error bounds; applied information-theoretic methods for minimax lower bounds.

Result: Established optimal testing threshold scaling as Θ((nk)^{-1/2}) for complete graphs; developed practical hypothesis test with theoretical guarantees; validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous hypothesis testing framework for Thurstone models with minimax optimality, addressing fundamental model validation problem in pairwise comparison analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: Constructed large multimodal dataset with 9M accident records and 1M satellite images across six U.S. states, annotated with weather statistics, road types, and traffic volume. Evaluated multimodal learning methods integrating visual (satellite) and network (graph) embeddings using graph neural networks.

Result: Multimodal integration achieved 90.1% AUROC, a 3.7% improvement over graph-only models. Causal analysis revealed accident rates increase by 24% with higher precipitation, 22% on higher-speed roads, and 29% due to seasonal patterns. Ablation studies confirmed satellite imagery features are essential for accurate predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating satellite imagery with road network data significantly improves traffic accident prediction accuracy and enables more reliable causal analysis of contributing factors, demonstrating the value of multimodal approaches for transportation safety research.

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

### [191] [Fast Gaussian Process Approximations for Autocorrelated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02925)
*Ahmadreza Chokhachian,Matthias Katzfuss,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes methods to accelerate Gaussian process regression for autocorrelated data by adapting existing fast approximations to work with blocked data, preventing temporal overfitting while maintaining prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fast Gaussian process approximations assume independent, identically distributed data, but autocorrelated data causes temporal overfitting that degrades model performance on new test instances. Existing methods need modification to handle autocorrelation effectively.

Method: Adapts existing fast Gaussian process approximations to work with blocked data, where originally correlated data points are segmented into blocks to de-correlate the data. The paper explains how to modify these approximations to handle the blocked structure.

Result: Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets show the proposed approaches can significantly accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising prediction performance.

Conclusion: The proposed blocked data approach enables efficient Gaussian process regression for autocorrelated data, solving the temporal overfitting problem while maintaining computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

### [192] [Pruning AMR: Efficient Visualization of Implicit Neural Representations via Weight Matrix Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02967)
*Jennifer Zvonek,Andrew Gillette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PruningAMR algorithm creates adaptive mesh from implicit neural representations using weight matrix pruning to guide refinement, enabling memory-efficient visualization without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many visualization tasks using implicit neural representations (INRs) still require discretization to regular grids, which can be memory-intensive. While INRs are more memory-efficient than traditional lattice storage, there's a need for automatic mesh generation that adapts to the underlying function's resolution without requiring access to training data.

Method: PruningAMR uses interpolative decomposition pruning on INR weight matrices to identify geometric features. The pruned network guides adaptive mesh refinement, creating a variable-resolution mesh tailored to the function's inherent resolution. The approach works with pre-trained INRs without needing their training data.

Result: The algorithm produces variable resolution visualizations with substantial memory savings by creating adaptive meshes that match the underlying resolution of the function encoded in the INR.

Conclusion: PruningAMR enables efficient visualization of INR-based data through automatic adaptive mesh generation, addressing memory limitations while maintaining accuracy by adapting to geometric features identified through network pruning.

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides better prognostic value than pre-treatment imaging for predicting functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke, and to develop a robust predictive framework combining imaging and clinical data.

Method: Analyzed 74 AIS patients with paired ADC scans at baseline (J0) and 24-hours (J1). Used 3D ResNet-50 to extract imaging embeddings, fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via PCA (≤12 components), and classified using linear SVMs with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation.

Result: J1 multimodal models achieved highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 ± 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC ≤ 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging, and combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features creates a robust, interpretable framework for predicting 3-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

TL;DR: A two-level Stack of Transformers (TT-Stack) ensemble framework using seven lightweight vision transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance for breast cancer detection in mammograms, with 99.33% accuracy and 99.97% ROC-AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis systems have limitations in feature representation and generalization across diverse mammographic images.

Method: Proposes TT-Stack ensemble framework integrating seven lightweight vision transformers (RepViT, DaViT, EfficientViT, MobileViT, FasterViT, MViT, PVT v2) with a two-tier meta-learning approach. Models process single-channel grayscale mammograms using transfer learning from ImageNet pre-training. Training includes stratified splits, class-balanced upsampling, early stopping, and adaptive learning rate schedules on the Mammogram Mastery dataset.

Result: EfficientViT and PVT-v2 were top-performing individual models with 99.33% validation accuracy, 97.96% F1-score, and perfect 1.000:0 ROC-AUC. The TT-Stack ensemble achieved 99.33% accuracy, 100% precision, 96% recall, 97.96% F1-score, and 99.97% ROC-AUC, demonstrating robust performance through architectural diversity.

Conclusion: The TT-Stack ensemble framework provides a parameter-efficient, clinically applicable solution for breast cancer detection in mammograms, achieving exceptional performance metrics and robustness through the integration of diverse lightweight vision transformer architectures.

Abstract: Breast cancer continues to be the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths around the world, with early detection being important to improve survival rates for patients. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis systems have limitations in their ability to represent features and generalize to the range of mammographic images. We present a new two-level Stack of Transformers (TT-Stack) ensemble framework based on using heterogeneous lightweight vision transformer architectures to automatically identify breast cancer in mammograms. Specifically, we integrate seven state-of-the-art vision transformers: RepViT, DaViT, EfficientViT, MobileViT, FasterViT, MViT, and PVT v2 while also designing a two-tier meta-learning approach for the ensemble by simply taking the logits from the base model and applying logistic regression for binary classification (Cancer vs. Non-Cancer). Each of the transformer backbone models was developed to process single-channel grayscale mammograms while still taking advantage of transfer learning from pre-training on ImageNet so that they would offer a parameter-efficient approach that may reasonably be applied in clinical practice with minimal variance. The training process included stratified 80/20 splits when necessary, class-balanced upsampling, early stopping, and an adaptive learning rate schedule on the public Mammogram Mastery dataset. In separate evaluations here, it was determined that EfficientViT and PVT-v2 were the top per-forming models achieving 99.33% validation, 97.96% F1-score, and perfect 1.000:0 ROC-AUC with only small train/validation gaps. Finally, the TT-Stack ensemble model by the end of the evaluation reached 99.33% accuracy with 100% precision, 96% recall, 97.96% F1-score and a 99.97% ROC-AUC, and demonstrated robustness in performance due to the diversity of the architecture.

TL;DR: AI-based PETfectior software enables high-quality PET imaging with half the standard radiation dose while maintaining lesion detectability and quantitative accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs in PET imaging while maintaining diagnostic quality by using AI to enhance low-count-rate images.

Method: Prospective study of 258 patients with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Standard scans (100%) were compared with half-counting-statistics versions processed with PETfectior (50%+PETfectior). Lesion detection, SUVmax measurements, and subjective image quality were evaluated.

Result: High sensitivity (99.9%) for lesion detection with only 1 false positive. SUVmax agreement within 12.5% (bias -1.01%). Image quality rated equal to or better than standard scans.

Conclusion: PETfectior can be safely used clinically at half counting statistics, providing high sensitivity, low quantitative bias, and excellent image quality while reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: Background: Diagnostic PET image quality depends on the administered activity and acquisition time. However, minimizing these variables is desirable to reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs. PETfectior is an artificial intelligence-based software that processes PET scans and increases signal-to-noise ratio, obtaining high-quality images from low-count-rate images. We perform an initial clinical validation of PETfectior on images acquired with half of the counting statistics required to meet the most recent EANM quantitative standards for 18F-FDG PET, evaluating lesions detectability, quantitative performance and image quality.
  Materials and methods: 258 patients referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively included. The standard-of-care scans (100% scans) were acquired and reconstructed according to EARL standards 2. Half-counting-statistics versions were generated from list-mode data and processed with PETfecftior (50%+PETfectior scans). All oncologic lesions were segmented on both PET/CT versions, manually or automatically, and lesions detectability was evaluated. The SUVmax of the lesions was measured and the quantitative concordance of 50%+PETfectior and 100% images was evaluated. Subjective image quality was visually assessed by two experienced physicians.
  Results: 1649 lesions were detected in a total of 198 studies. The 50%+PETfectior images showed high sensitivity for lesion detection (99.9%) and only 1 false positive was detected. The SUVmax measured in 100% and 50%+PETfectior images agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement), with a bias of -1.01%. Image quality of the 50%+PETfectior images was rated equal to or better than the standard-of-care images.
  Conclusion: PETfectior can safely be used in clinical practice at half counting statistics, with high sensitivity and specificity, low quantitative bias and high subjective image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize linear codes over Z_{p^s} to codes over finite chain rings, studying simplex codes as important families of codes with good properties for coding theory applications.

Method: Construct linear simplex codes over finite chain rings R and their corresponding R-linear simplex codes of type α and β using generalized Gray map images.

Result: Present fundamental parameters including minimum Hamming distance and complete weight distributions, and analyze optimality with respect to Griesmer-type bound.

Conclusion: The paper successfully constructs and analyzes simplex codes over finite chain rings, providing their complete characterization and optimality properties.

Abstract: A linear code of length $n$ over a finite chain ring $R$ with residue field $\F_q$ is a $R$-submodule of $R^n$. A $R$-linear code is a code over $\F_q$ (not necessarily linear) which is the generalized Gray map image of a linear code over $R$. These codes can be seen as a generalization of the linear codes over $\Z_{p^s}$ with $p$ prime and $s \geq 1$. In this paper, we present the construction of linear simplex codes over $R$ and their corresponding $R$-linear simplex codes of type $α$ and $β$. Moreover, we show the fundamental parameters of these codes, including their minimum Hamming distance, as well as their complete weight distributions. We also study whether these simplex codes are optimal with respect to the Griesmer-type bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address energy constraints in LEO satellite communications by improving energy efficiency and signal performance while reducing power consumption.

Method: Uses double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) positioned in near-field of satellite and user, with far-field distance between RISs, plus dual-stage beamforming for signal optimization.

Result: Simulation shows 40 dB power reduction in uplink with small 0.25 m² RIS near user, enabling energy-efficient LEO satellite communication.

Conclusion: Double-RIS architecture with proper positioning and beamforming significantly improves energy efficiency for low-power LEO satellite communications.

Abstract: We propose a low-power mobile low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication architecture, employing double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency and signal performance. With a distance between RISs that satisfies the far-field requirement, this architecture positions one small RIS each in the near-field of the satellite's antenna and the user on the ground. Moreover, we develop a path loss model for the double-RIS communication link, considering the near-field and far-field effects. Further, with the help of dual-stage beamforming, the proposed system maximizes the signal power and minimizes power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption with 40 dB in the uplink, with a small $0.25^2$ $\text{m}^2$ RIS near the user, to communicate in energy-constrained LEO satellite communication circumstances.

TL;DR: The paper explores how quotients of finite reflection groups and classical groups over finite fields relate to information-theoretic entropies, extending beyond symmetric groups to other Dynkin series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend information-theoretic entropy concepts beyond symmetric groups (which yield Shannon entropy) and general linear groups (which yield Tsallis entropy) to other finite reflection groups and classical groups of Lie type.

Method: Analyze parabolic subgroups as stabilizers of flags, study quotients by these subgroups representing orbits of flags, and examine asymptotic cardinalities of these orbits for different group series (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n and exceptional groups).

Result: Some group series (beyond A_n) are linked to new entropic functionals, with symmetric groups corresponding to Shannon entropy and general linear groups to Tsallis 2-entropy, while other series yield previously unexplored entropy forms.

Conclusion: Finite reflection groups and classical groups over finite fields provide a rich mathematical framework for generating various entropy functionals, extending traditional information theory concepts through group-theoretic constructions.

Abstract: For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes new non-GRS MDS codes with lengths up to (q+3)/2 for odd fields and (q+4)/2 for even fields, analyzes their properties, and develops efficient algorithms for GRS code identification and key recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To construct longer non-GRS MDS codes than existing methods and develop efficient algorithms for determining whether a code is GRS and recovering its key parameters, addressing computational efficiency issues in GRS code analysis.

Method: Uses Cauchy matrix method to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for codes to be MDS and non-GRS MDS. Analyzes inequivalence with twisted GRS codes. Designs two algorithms for GRS code identification (from generator matrix) and key vector recovery with O(nk+n) complexity.

Result: Achieves longer code lengths than previous constructions: up to (q+3)/2 for odd characteristic fields and (q+4)/2 for even characteristic fields. Algorithms significantly outperform Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack (O(qk²n+qk³) vs O(nk+n)).

Conclusion: The proposed non-GRS MDS codes achieve record lengths, and the developed algorithms provide efficient solutions for GRS code identification and parameter recovery problems with superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for constructing a class of non-GRS MDS codes. The lengths of these codes can reach up to $\frac{q+3}{2}$ (for finite fields of odd characteristic) and $\frac{q+4}{2}$ (for even characteristic), respectively. Owing to their special structure, we can use the Cauchy matrix method to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for these codes to be MDS codes and non-GRS MDS codes. Additionally, the inequivalence between these codes and twisted GRS codes is analyzed. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among several existing classes of codes used for constructing non-GRS MDS codes, propose explicit constructions, and discuss the lengths of non-GRS MDS codes based on these constructions. Finally, we design two efficient algorithms to address two main problems in GRS code research, i.e., determining whether an unknown code $C$ is a GRS code from its generator matrix $G$, and recovering the key vectors $\bmα$ and $\bm{v}$ such that $C = \GRS_{n,k}(\bmα, \bm{v})$ if $C$ is indeed a GRS code. A computational complexity comparison of the proposed algorithms ($O(nk+n)$) with that of the Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack (exceeding $O(qk^2n+qk^3)$) shows that our methods offer superior computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical wireless systems face limitations from imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rates, which significantly impact Age of Information (AoI) performance. Existing work often overlooks these practical constraints, creating a need for scheduling algorithms that can optimize AoI under these realistic conditions.

Method: For zero feedback with generate-at-will traffic: derived closed-form lower bound for achievable AoI and proposed a policy using rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback with Bernoulli traffic: developed a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with threshold structure based on Lyapunov optimization theory. Extended DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing computational complexity.

Result: Achieved closed-form lower bound for AoI under zero feedback (first time reflecting zero feedback impact), with proposed policy achieving this bound in many cases. Provided closed-form performance guarantee for DPP policy under Bernoulli traffic. Extended policies maintain low computational complexity while supporting imperfect feedback.

Conclusion: The proposed scheduling algorithms effectively optimize AoI under practical constraints of imperfect feedback and limited transmission rates, outperforming state-of-the-art policies while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper considers a downlink system where an access point sends the monitored status of multiple sources to multiple users. By jointly accounting for imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rate, which are key limited factors in practical systems, we aim to design scheduling algorithms to optimize the age of information (AoI) over the infinite time horizon. For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot structure and multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm for multi-user MIMO-OTFS systems to reduce pilot overhead and improve performance in high-mobility scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional embedded pilot schemes in multi-user OTFS systems require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. There's a need for efficient channel estimation and pilot design for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks.

Method: 1) Multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm: estimates AoAs via subspace decomposition, uses spatial projection matrix to decouple signals and mitigate inter-path interference, then obtains fractional delay and Doppler via compressed sensing. 2) Novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure: reuses users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu sequences to reduce pilot overhead. 3) Improved channel estimation method based on CSEP structure.

Result: CSEP structure saves over 30% pilot overhead compared to conventional embedded pilot structures. The proposed algorithm achieves superior channel estimation performance with favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and BER performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm effectively address pilot overhead and performance challenges in multi-user MIMO-OTFS systems, making them suitable for high-mobility wireless communication scenarios.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to meet the demand for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks. However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance.

*Emanuele Bossi,C. Tyler Diggans,Abd AlRahman R. AlMomani*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI), a normalized measure for clustered continuous data that quantifies how well a partition reflects both cluster population and geometric extent, providing coherent assessment even when traditional metrics fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering metrics often give incomplete or misleading signals, especially in scenarios where both frequency-based and geometry-based distributions matter. There's a need for a measure that captures the interaction between demographic weight and geometric spread in clustered data, particularly for applications like resource allocation and algorithmic governance.

Method: The BSI builds on geometric coarse-graining and information theory principles. It quantifies the interaction between frequency-based probability distributions (cluster populations) and geometry-based probability distributions (effective geometric extent of clusters). The index provides a normalized measure that assesses how well a partition reflects both aspects simultaneously.

Result: BSI demonstrates coherent assessment on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, Iris benchmark, and high-imbalance resource-allocation scenarios. It detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity and provides a smooth, optimization-ready objective that favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in outcome space.

Conclusion: BSI offers a novel normalized measure for clustered continuous data that effectively captures the interaction between frequency and geometry distributions. It serves as both an assessment tool and a gradient-friendly regularizer that can be embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks, addressing limitations of traditional clustering metrics.

Abstract: We introduce the Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI), a normalized measure for clustered continuous data that captures the interaction between frequency-based and geometry-based probability distributions. Building on ideas from geometric coarse-graining and information theory, the BSI quantifies how well a partition reflects both the population of each cluster and its effective geometric extent. We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks.

*Brendon McBain,Yi Hong,Emanuele Viterbo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Develops analytical framework for LEO satellite network capacity under arbitrary handover strategies, deriving ergodic capacity bounds and optimal handover decision rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of satellite mega-constellations have restrictive assumptions (short serving times) or lack tractability for realistic handover strategies, limiting accurate capacity characterization.

Method: Models transmission as shadowed-Rician fading, introduces persistent satellite channel with i.i.d. renewal process, uses renewal theory to derive ergodic capacity, formulates optimal handover as non-linear fractional program solved via Dinkelbach's algorithm variant.

Result: Derives closed-form upper/lower bounds on persistent capacity, obtains explicit optimal handover decision rule, shows simpler strategy maximizing serving capacity closely approximates optimal.

Conclusion: Provides practical framework for designing high-throughput LEO satellite systems with tractable analysis of handover strategies and capacity characterization.

Abstract: Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems.

*Peng Zhang,Jian Dang,Miaowen Wen,Ziyang Liu,Chen Zhao,Huaifeng Shi,Chengsheng Pan,Zaichen Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes an artificial-noise-aided physical layer security scheme for near-field fluid-antenna MIMO systems with joint beamforming and AN design for both compact and large arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With wireless systems evolving toward large-scale arrays and high-frequency reconfigurable architectures, fluid antenna systems operating in the near-field regime provide new degrees of freedom for physical layer security that need to be exploited.

Method: Uses alternating-optimization framework splitting into continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Obtains closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions via generalized spectral water-filling with BCD surrogate, realized by hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming architecture. For FAS port selection, uses row-energy based prune--refit rule aligned with KKT conditions.

Result: Simulation results confirm the proposed design exploits geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where near-field beam focusing alone is inadequate.

Conclusion: The AN-aided PLS scheme effectively leverages near-field fluid-antenna MIMO capabilities to enhance physical layer security, with practical implementation through efficient optimization methods and hardware-aware architectures.

Abstract: With the evolution of wireless systems toward large-scale arrays and high-frequency reconfigurable architectures, fluid antenna systems (FAS) operating in the near-field (NF) regime provide new degrees of freedom (DoF) for physical layer security (PLS). This paper proposes an artificial-noise (AN)-aided PLS scheme for NF fluid-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (FA-MIMO) systems, with joint beamforming (BF) and AN design for both compact and large arrays. An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design exploits the geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where NF beam focusing alone is inadequate.

*Bach Hung Luu,Sinh Cong Lam,Nam Hoang Nguyen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: UAV-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control improves cell-edge user performance using distance-based UAV relay assistance and DQN-based power optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell-edge users suffer from poor channel conditions and low data rates compared to cell-center users due to distance and obstructions, creating a performance gap in cellular networks.

Method: Proposes UAV-assisted cellular network with distance-based criterion where only users beyond reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Uses amplify-and-forward UAV relays for diversity gain. Employs Deep Q-Network learning framework for optimal power allocation without requiring accurate channel models.

Result: Achieves peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at optimal reference distance of 400m, representing 3.6% improvement over no UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement over full UAV assistance. Lower UAV altitudes provide better performance.

Conclusion: Distance-based UAV relay assistance with intelligent power control effectively improves cell-edge user performance. UAV altitude and reference distance are critical optimization parameters for system performance.

Abstract: Cell-edge users (CEUs) in cellular networks typically suffer from poor channel conditions due to long distances from serving base stations and physical obstructions, resulting in much lower data rates compared to cell-center users (CCUs). This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance.

### [208] [Digit-Indexed q-ary SEC-DED Codes with Near-Hamming Overhead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02747)
*Jiaxu Hu,Kenneth J. Roche*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A family of q-ary SEC-DED codes with simple digit-based parity checks, near-Hamming overhead, and fast constant-time decoding, with extensions for higher rates and distance-4 codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create simple, array-friendly error-correcting codes with implementational simplicity rather than optimality, featuring explicit syndrome-to-error mapping and modular design for practical applications.

Method: Construct SEC-DED codes using parity checks tied to base-p digits of coordinate indices, requiring only r+1 parity checks for blocklength n=p^r. Develop two extensions: Code A1 removes redundant trits for higher rate and variable-length encoding; Code A2 adds group-sum checks with 3-wise XOR independence for distance-4 SEC-TED codes.

Result: Achieves near-Hamming overhead with r+1 parity checks, constant-time decoding, and demonstrates generalization to distance d=n+1 codes, recovering the ternary Golay code for n=5.

Conclusion: The codes offer practical advantages in simplicity, array-friendly structure, and modular design, positioning them as attractive alternatives to classical Hamming and SPC/product codes for applications prioritizing implementation ease over theoretical optimality.

Abstract: We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.
  Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.

### [209] [Structural Properties of Entropic Vectors and Stability of the Ingleton Inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02767)
*Rostislav Matveev,Andrei Romashchenko*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper studies constrained versions of the Ingleton inequality in information theory, quantifying its stability under small violations of conditional independence constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the classical Ingleton inequality fails for general entropy profiles, it's known to hold under certain exact independence constraints. The authors want to understand what happens when these constraints are only approximately satisfied (small but non-zero conditional mutual information).

Method: The authors develop a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon-type inequalities. This provides conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking infinite families of inequalities.

Result: The paper shows that the Ingleton inequality continues to hold up to controlled error terms when selected conditional mutual information terms are small. Some bounds recover known results from Matúš (2007) and Dougherty-Freiling-Zeger (2011), while others appear to be new.

Conclusion: The structural lemma approach provides a unified framework for understanding the stability of the Ingleton inequality under approximate independence constraints, offering transparent proofs that avoid explicit use of infinite families of non-Shannon inequalities.

Abstract: We study constrained versions of the Ingleton inequality in the entropic setting and quantify its stability under small violations of conditional independence. Although the classical Ingleton inequality fails for general entropy profiles, it is known to hold under certain exact independence constraints. We focus on the regime where selected conditional mutual information terms are small (but not zero), and the inequality continues to hold up to controlled error terms. A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families. Some of our bounds recover, in a unified way, what can also be deduced from the infinite families of inequalities of Matúš (2007) and of Dougherty--Freiling--Zeger (2011), while others appear to be new.

### [210] [Pseudocodewords of quantum, quasi-cyclic, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes: a fundamental cone perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02941)
*Wittawat Kositwattanarerk,Gretchen L. Matthews,Emily McMillon,Tunchanok Yutitumsatit*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Analysis of pseudocodewords in LDPC codes, focusing on their dependence on parity-check matrices and decoding algorithms, with specific examination of LP decoding connections to graph cover decoding and applications to quantum stabilizer codes, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LDPC codes achieve near-capacity performance with iterative decoders, these decoders may fail to output valid codewords due to pseudocodewords. Understanding pseudocodewords provides insights into modern decoder performance, but they depend on both the parity-check matrix and specific decoding algorithm used.

Method: The paper focuses on LP (Linear Programming) decoding, which has connections to graph cover decoding. The authors analyze pseudocodewords through functions that capture these structures, specifically examining quantum stabilizer codes, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes.

Result: The paper provides structural analysis of pseudocodewords arising from LP decoding in three specific code families: quantum stabilizer codes, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes, revealing their underlying characteristics.

Conclusion: Pseudocodewords are crucial for understanding decoder performance limitations, and their analysis through LP decoding connections to graph cover decoding provides valuable insights into the behavior of modern coding schemes across different code families.

Abstract: While low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are near capacity-achieving when paired with iterative decoders, these decoders may not output a codeword due to the existence of pseudocodewords. Thus, pseudocodewords have been studied to give insight into the performance of modern decoders including iterative and linear programming decoders. These pseudocodewords are found to be dependent on the parity-check matrix of the code and the particular decoding algorithm used. In this paper, we consider LP decoding, which has been linked to graph cover decoding, providing functions which capture these pseudocodewords. In particular, we analyze the underlying structure of pseudocodewords from quantum stabilizer codes that arise from LP decoding, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes.

### [211] [The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080)
*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a formal convergence theorem for LLM-verifier systems, proving termination with provable guarantees and validating it through extensive empirical testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based formal verification methods are unreliable without theoretical foundations, causing unpredictable refinement processes that can wander, loop, or diverge from stable trajectories.

Method: Models LLM-verifier interaction as a discrete-time Markov Chain with error-reduction probability (δ) parameter, develops LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem proving termination for any δ>0 with bounded expected iterations (E[n] ≤ 4/δ), and validates with 90,000+ empirical trials.

Result: Every run reached verification, convergence factor clustered around 1.0, empirical results matched theory precisely, enabling identification of three operating zones (marginal, practical, high-performance) with clear design thresholds.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical guarantees and experimental evidence for predictable LLM-assisted verification, enabling reliable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software deployment.

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for decomposing complex world models (transducers) into modular subcomponents to enable parallelizable, interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic world models for AI agents often have high computational demands, but real-world scenarios typically involve modular subcomponents that interact. This paper aims to exploit this modularity to create more efficient and interpretable world models.

Method: Developed a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers (generalizing POMDPs). The approach inverts the composition process to derive sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces.

Result: The framework enables parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modeling that can support distributed inference, bridging structural transparency with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: These results lay groundwork for bridging AI safety's structural transparency demands with the computational efficiency required for real-world inference through modular decomposition of world models.

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

TL;DR: STRIDE is a framework that determines when to use agentic AI vs simpler LLM approaches, reducing unnecessary agent deployments by 45% and cutting costs by 37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid shift from stateless LLMs to autonomous agents raises questions about when agentic AI is truly necessary, as indiscriminate deployment leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.

Method: STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, recommending between direct LLM calls, guided AI assistants, or fully autonomous agentic AI.

Result: Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months confirmed practical utility.

Conclusion: This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs, distinguishing between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy.

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite numerous digital collaboration tools, routine financial processes still suffer from human error and delays. The research aims to address this gap by investigating whether general-purpose LLM agents can effectively handle wealth-management tasks that currently require human assistants.

Method: Extended TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment, created synthetic domain data, enriched colleague simulations, and prototyped an automatic task-generation pipeline.

*Lewen Yan,Jilin Mei,Tianyi Zhou,Lige Huang,Jie Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TradeTrap is a framework for stress-testing autonomous trading agents by injecting system-level perturbations across four core components, revealing vulnerabilities that can cause extreme financial losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real financial markets but their reliability under adversarial conditions remains unexamined, despite operating in high-risk environments where failures can cause irreversible financial damage.

Method: TradeTrap systematically stress-tests both adaptive and procedural trading agents by targeting four core components: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio/ledger handling, and trade execution. It injects controlled system-level perturbations and evaluates agents in closed-loop historical backtesting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions for fair comparisons.

Result: Small perturbations at single components can propagate through the agent decision loop, inducing extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Conclusion: Current autonomous trading agents have significant vulnerabilities to system-level perturbations, highlighting the need for more robust designs and systematic testing frameworks like TradeTrap to ensure reliability in real-world financial environments.

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI systems lack self-monitoring, self-correction, and autonomous regulation capabilities despite advances in perception and language. Seven core deficiencies prevent robust generalization and real-world autonomy, requiring a shift toward cognitively grounded AI architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid AI progress in perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains, modern systems remain fundamentally limited in self-monitoring, self-correction, and autonomous behavior regulation. These limitations prevent robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy.

Method: Identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies in contemporary AI models through comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition, integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Outlines forward-looking perspective on AI evolution beyond these limitations.

Result: Identifies seven key deficiencies: absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed non-adaptive learning, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and absence of intrinsic agency. Shows scaling alone cannot resolve these structural limitations.

Conclusion: Advocates for paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms to ensure interpretability, governability, and alignment with human values.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

### [218] [DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282)
*Han Luo,Guy Laban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DialogGuard is a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM responses across five dimensions, using LLM-as-a-judge pipelines to improve safety evaluation for mental health and crisis applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in mental health, crisis, and emotionally sensitive services, but their psychosocial safety remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated, creating risks for vulnerable users.

Method: Multi-agent framework with four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines (single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, stochastic majority voting) using a shared three-level rubric to assess five psychosocial risk dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behavior, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behavior.

Result: Multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide best trade-off between accuracy, human alignment, and robustness; debate achieves higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

Conclusion: DialogGuard provides an effective open-source framework for assessing LLM psychosocial safety, supporting prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users through explainable risk scores and rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental- health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent frame- work for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discrimi- natory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse gen- erative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi- agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog- Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language ratio- nales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

Result: Achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs, with experiments revealing an inverse relationship between memory and energy consumption at fixed accuracy levels.

Conclusion: MERINDA demonstrates suitability for resource-constrained, real-time mission-critical autonomous systems by providing efficient FPGA-accelerated Model Recovery with significant memory and runtime improvements over GPU-based approaches.

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

*Varun Kumar Dasoju,Qingsu Cheng,Zeyun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Achieves 95.5% Dice score for breast cell segmentation using only 599 training images by combining quantum-inspired edge enhancement, stabilized multi-component loss, and complexity-based sampling to address severe class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation requires significant time and expertise from pathologists, creating a bottleneck for clinical AI development. The paper addresses the challenge of limited annotated data (just 599 images) with severe class imbalance where breast tissue represents only 4% of pixels.

Method: Uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters as a fourth input channel, stabilized multi-component loss integrating adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms, complexity-based weighted sampling, EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with 4-to-3 channel projection, and robust validation with exponential moving averaging and outlier detection.

Result: Achieves 95.5% +/- 0.3% Dice score and 91.2% +/- 0.4% IoU. Quantum-based enhancement improves boundary accuracy by 2.1%, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%.

Conclusion: The framework significantly reduces medical expert annotation time by achieving high performance with limited data, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development through innovative solutions for class imbalance and boundary detection.

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

*Boyu Zhu,Xiaofei Wen,Wenjie Jacky Mo,Tinghui Zhu,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGuard is a family of omni-modal guardrails that provides safety protection across text, images, videos, and audio with reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations of previous unimodal binary classification approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails for Large Language Models are mostly unimodal and use binary classification, which lacks robustness across diverse modalities and tasks in omni-modal AI systems.

Method: Created OmniGuard with deliberate reasoning ability, trained on a large omni-modal safety dataset (210K+ samples) covering all modalities through unimodal and cross-modal samples, annotated with structured safety labels and expert model critiques.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show strong effectiveness and generalization across wide range of multimodal safety scenarios, providing unified framework for policy enforcement and risk mitigation.

Conclusion: OmniGuard paves the way toward more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems by addressing the safety challenges of omni-modal LLMs across all modalities.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

*Qiyao Xue,Weichen Liu,Shiqi Wang,Haoming Wang,Yuyang Wu,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new benchmark (ReMindView-Bench) reveals that current vision-language models struggle with multi-view spatial reasoning despite good single-view perception, showing failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack geometric coherence and cross-view consistency in spatial reasoning, but there's no fine-grained benchmark isolating multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors.

Method: Created ReMindView-Bench with systematic variation of viewpoint spatial patterns and query types to probe spatial cognition. Evaluated 15 VLMs using explicit phase-wise analysis (LLM-as-a-judge, self-consistency) and implicit analysis (linear probing, entropy dynamics).

Result: VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct/incorrect trajectories observed.

Conclusion: Provides cognitive diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning limitations, revealing how multi-view spatial mental models degrade across reasoning phases. Benchmark enables deeper analysis of spatial reasoning failures.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

*Ran Zhang,Kun Ouyang,Tiancheng Ma,Yida Yang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-powered generative agent simulation system for MMO game optimization that mimics real player behavior using fine-tuned language models and data-driven environment modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MMO optimization methods are costly, disruptive, and rely on limited-fidelity simulations that fail to accurately capture real player reasoning and reactions to game interventions.

Method: Propose a generative agent-based simulation using LLMs fine-tuned with SFT and RL on real player data, combined with a data-driven environment model trained on gameplay logs to reconstruct dynamic game systems.

Result: The system demonstrates strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses to interventions, providing a reliable framework for numerical design optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-powered generative agent simulation offers a cost-efficient, interpretable, and data-driven alternative to traditional MMO optimization methods, enabling realistic player behavior modeling without disrupting actual gameplay.

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

*David X. Wu,Shreyas Kapur,Anant Sahai,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Supervised learning with synthetic error injection fails to induce effective self-correction in LLMs, explaining why on-policy RL remains superior for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find computationally cheaper alternatives to reinforcement learning for eliciting self-correction capabilities in large language models, inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Injecting artificial errors into reasoning chains, masking them, and using supervised learning to train models to recognize and correct these synthetic mistakes.

Result: The method fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Models often parrot original mistakes even when catching errors, and synthetic-to-on-policy distribution shift degrades error-correction capabilities.

Conclusion: Synthetic error injection via supervised learning is ineffective for self-correction, explaining why on-policy reinforcement learning methods remain uniquely effective for this capability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agent pipeline identifies hidden relationships between prediction markets and creates profitable trading strategies using semantic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction markets suffer from fragmentation with overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across different markets, making it difficult to identify relationships between them.

Method: An agentic AI pipeline that: (1) clusters markets into topical groups using natural-language understanding of contract text and metadata, and (2) identifies market pairs with strong outcome dependencies (correlated or anti-correlated) within clusters.

Result: Agent-identified relationships achieve 60-70% accuracy, and trading strategies based on these relationships earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons on Polymarket historical data.

Conclusion: Agentic AI and large language models can effectively uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets, transforming discovered relationships into actionable trading signals with significant profitability.

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-Few introduces a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight to enable stable AI self-evolution, achieving consistent improvements on reasoning benchmarks with minimal human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI self-evolution systems often plateau or degrade due to concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, where models reinforce their own biases and converge to low-entropy behaviors. There's a need for stable, controllable self-evolution with minimal human supervision.

Method: R-Few uses a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. The Challenger samples human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum.

Result: R-Few achieves consistent iterative improvements across math and general reasoning benchmarks. Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and matches performance of General-Reasoner trained on 20× more human data. The framework mitigates drift and yields stable, controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Conclusion: R-Few demonstrates that guided self-evolution with lightweight human oversight enables stable, iterative improvement in AI systems, addressing key challenges of unguided self-evolution while minimizing reliance on extensive human supervision.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COPE is a Chain-of-Thought LLM framework that predicts 90-day functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke from unstructured clinical notes, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich contextual information for stroke outcome prediction but their unstructured nature limits use in traditional predictive models, creating a need for better methods to leverage this valuable data.

Method: Two-step Chain-of-Thought framework using sequential LLaMA-3-8B models: first generates clinical reasoning, second outputs mRS prediction. Compared against GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, structured ML model, and single-step LLM.

Result: COPE achieved MAE of 1.01, +/-1 accuracy of 74.4%, exact accuracy of 32.8% - comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to other models. Consistent performance across subgroups with slightly higher error in older patients, thrombectomy cases, and longer summaries.

Conclusion: COPE provides an accurate, lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source solution for stroke outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text, demonstrating practical utility for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

*Yufei Xiao,Shangfei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal empathy prediction method using video, audio, and text with supervisory documents as privileged information during training only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empathy prediction methods focus on single modalities (usually text) and ignore multi-modal processing and privileged information that could contain additional empathetic content.

Method: Multi-modal empathy prediction with supervisory document assisted training. Uses pre-trained networks to extract video, audio, and text features, followed by cross-modal fusion. Incorporates supervisory documents (counseling topics and counselor empathy displays) as privileged information during training via Latent Dirichlet Allocation to constrain text features.

Result: Experimental results on multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets show superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal approach with supervisory document assisted training effectively improves empathy prediction by leveraging multiple modalities and privileged information during training.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger successfully brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into academic writing environments, addressing technical challenges of in-editor interaction and enabling context-aware operations within LaTeX editors.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Motivation: Address limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, and mitigate error propagation in unidirectional function calls.

Method: Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT) - a computational model that autonomously grows dynamic, recursive agent topologies based on user dialogue, using bidirectional stateful dialogues instead of rigid invocations to enable runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution.

Result: Production deployment in kragent.ai system with qualitative evidence from real-world workflows (no exhaustive benchmark results presented).

Conclusion: IACT provides a general-purpose autonomous system that scales organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks through dialogue-driven dynamic agent topologies with interactional redundancy for error correction.

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

### [232] [Target-specific Adaptation and Consistent Degradation Alignment for Cross-Domain Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02610)
*Yubo Hou,Mohamed Ragab,Min Wu,Chee-Keong Kwoh,Xiaoli Li,Zhenghua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TACDA is a novel domain adaptation method for cross-domain RUL prediction that addresses domain discrepancy by combining target domain reconstruction with consistent degradation stage alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RUL prediction faces domain discrepancy issues where training and testing data come from different distributions, causing existing adversarial domain adaptation methods to perform poorly by ignoring target-specific information and degradation stage inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes TACDA with two key strategies: 1) target domain reconstruction within adversarial adaptation to preserve target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features, and 2) clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

Result: Extensive experiments show TACDA achieves remarkable performance, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches on two different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TACDA effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in RUL prediction by preserving target-specific information and ensuring consistent degradation stage alignment, making it suitable for real industrial settings with domain discrepancies.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel RL method for LTL tasks using Boolean formula sequences and GNN encoding to handle concurrent/interacting propositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTL-to-automata RL approaches fail in environments where multiple atomic propositions can be true simultaneously and interact complexly, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with concurrent events.

Method: Conditions policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae aligned with automaton transitions, encoded via graph neural network (GNN) to create structured task representations.

Result: Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate advantages over existing approaches in handling concurrent/interacting propositions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of prior LTL-based RL approaches by using Boolean formula sequences and GNN encoding to handle environments with concurrent, interacting propositions.

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

### [234] [Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677)
*Zhiyuan He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard transformers struggle with depth generalization (handling deeper nested structures than seen in training), unlike length generalization. The paper proposes a looped locate-and-replace pipeline using specialized models to decompose recursive problems, showing improved performance on out-of-distribution recursion depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel at many tasks but face challenges with recursive reasoning problems requiring nested hierarchical structures. While length generalization has been studied, depth generalization (handling deeper recursion than seen during training) remains underexplored. Standard transformers struggle with maintaining stack-like behavior for tracking multiple levels of nested dependencies.

Method: Developed a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. Uses two specialized models: (1) a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions, and (2) a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. This approach enables handling deeper recursion by breaking down complex nested problems.

Result: Evaluated on three domains with controllable recursion depth: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic. The method effectively alleviates performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth, demonstrating improved depth generalization compared to standard transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Depth generalization is a distinct limitation of standard transformers for recursive reasoning problems. The proposed looped locate-and-replace pipeline addresses this architectural constraint by decomposing problems into solvable subcomponents, enabling better handling of deeper nested structures beyond training distribution.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

*Hyeongseop Rha,Jeong Hun Yeo,Junil Won,Se Jin Park,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIGR is a framework that improves multimodal emotion understanding by guiding reasoning to start from the emotion-dominant modality, reducing reasoning drift and inconsistent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal emotion understanding methods suffer from reasoning drift where models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and explanations become overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths, leading to emotionally inconsistent explanations.

Method: Introduces Modality Importance (MI) mechanism to identify emotion-dominant modality, reorganizes reasoning sequences to start from most critical modality, and uses two-stage framework: modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization.

Result: On DFEW benchmark, MIGR reduces instances of correct predictions with emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%, substantially improving reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: Starting reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality significantly improves the reliability of multimodal emotion understanding, producing more emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations in generative models by understanding how specific training data contributes to model outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models to extract structured triples from images aligned with domain-specific ontologies, then compares knowledge graphs of generated and training images to trace potential influences.

Result: Validated through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning and on large-scale models through style-specific experiments, showing ability to trace training data influences.

Conclusion: The framework supports development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity, and curiosity by enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

TL;DR: StockMem: A dual-layer memory framework for stock prediction that structures news into events and tracks their evolution to extract market expectation discrepancies, outperforming existing memory architectures with explainable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock prediction is difficult due to market volatility and noisy news data. LLMs struggle with finance applications because news lacks explicit answers, and general memory architectures can't identify key price movement drivers.

Method: Proposes StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events with horizontal consolidation (daily events) and longitudinal tracking (event evolution) to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base, then analyzes event-price dynamics to form a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences.

Result: Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Conclusion: StockMem effectively addresses challenges in stock prediction by structuring noisy news data into meaningful events, tracking their evolution, and learning causal experiences, resulting in better performance and explainable forecasting.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Motivation: Traditional rule-based Journal Entry Tests (JETs) generate too many false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities in tax-related ledger records, creating a need for more effective anomaly detection methods.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA and Gemma) on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, comparing them against traditional JETs and machine learning baselines for anomaly detection in double-entry bookkeeping.

### [240] [Self-Improving AI Agents through Self-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02731)
*Przemyslaw Chojecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends psychometric battery theory to dynamical systems by modeling agents as flows parameterized by computational resources, introducing a Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that creates vector fields on parameter manifolds, and deriving a Variance Inequality that ensures stable self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond static agent capability assessments (like AAI scores) to a dynamical systems framework that can model how agents improve over time with computational resources, and to unify various self-improvement architectures under a common theoretical framework.

Method: The paper formalizes agents as flows ν_r parameterized by computational resource r, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. This operator generates vector fields on parameter manifold Θ, with self-improvement coefficient κ defined as the Lie derivative of capability functional along the flow. The key theoretical contribution is the derivation of the Variance Inequality spectral condition for stability.

Result: The main results are: (1) the GVU operator generates a vector field on parameter manifolds, (2) identification of self-improvement coefficient κ as a Lie derivative, (3) derivation of the Variance Inequality as a sufficient condition for stable self-improvement (κ > 0), and (4) demonstration that architectures like STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs, and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator satisfying the Variance Inequality.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified moduli-theoretic framework for understanding self-improving dynamical systems, showing that various recent architectures in language self-play, self-correction, and synthetic data bootstrapping are special cases of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality condition for stable improvement.

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a way to generate both understandable and faithful explanations for non-interpretable models by using causal concept-based approaches and ensuring proper alignment between explanation contexts.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained.

Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated paper reproduction frameworks lack verification mechanisms at each generation step and rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, limiting adaptability and scalability.

Method: Proposes a prompt-free collaborative agent framework with two agents: a verification agent that checks outputs against system prompt requirements, and a refinement agent that revises outputs based on identified issues. Integrated into Paper2Code framework.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy and completeness of reproduced code by approximately 15% and 13% respectively compared to baseline without agents. Outperforms Self-Refine across different datasets, demonstrating robustness and consistency.

Conclusion: The prompt-free collaborative agent framework effectively enhances paper-to-code generation quality without requiring manually crafted refinement prompts, offering improved adaptability and scalability for automated paper reproduction.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI assistant provides comprehensive support for radiologists by automating the entire radiology reporting process with integrated quality control, addressing limitations of existing approaches that focus only on report generation.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency.

### [245] [Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02914)
*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM reasoning shows belief entrenchment - current beliefs predict future updates, violating Bayesian principles. Proposed Martingale Score measures this and correlates with accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in LLM reasoning, evidence suggests iterative reasoning may cause belief entrenchment and confirmation bias rather than truth-seeking. Need systematic evaluation of whether LLMs update beliefs rationally like Bayesian agents.

Method: Propose Martingale Score based on Bayesian Martingale property: under rational updating, future beliefs should be unpredictable from current beliefs. Use unsupervised regression to measure violations where current belief predicts future updates. Evaluate across event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic review domains.

Result: Widespread belief entrenchment across models and setups - current belief positively predicts future updates. Identified models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to entrenchment. Martingale Score predicts ground-truth accuracy where labels available, validating it as proxy for truth-seeking ability.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning exhibits systematic belief entrenchment violating Bayesian principles. Martingale Score provides unsupervised metric to assess truth-seeking ability even without ground truth, revealing limitations in current reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.
